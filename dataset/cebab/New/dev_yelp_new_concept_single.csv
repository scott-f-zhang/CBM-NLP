"Raspberry Macaroon! SOOOO DELICIOUS! They have lots of other pastries and cakes here, but the only thing I ever bought from them are their macaroons because it's just soo good. The outside has the perfect crispness, and the inside is soft, moist, and chewy. The chocolate macaroon tastes like a brownie, but wayyyy better than any normal brownie. I wish I had bought more than just 2 macaroons now :(.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Very busy and unorganized! Grab a number, weave your way to the display case to look at the eye candy and wait about 20+ min in a small cramped shop for your number to be called. I ended up getting a lobster tail, California cheesecake, and crumb cake. Waited another 15+ min for my name to be called so I can pay. There isn't a line for anything, so you really need to pay attention what they're calling out. Ended up being around $25 for those three items. Lobster tail was eh, cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard. California cheesecake was nothing special or unique. The crumb cake was the most disappointing, it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top, not even kidding. Don't waste your time or money here.",Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
"I went here the other day with my sister and I was surprised by how unique the flavors were! The place itself was designed really nicely and they even offer an aesthetic backdrop for your boba drinks and ice cream. I got the matcha & strawberry with boba and it was so good, it was a little sweet so the next time I come back I'm probably going to have to lessen the sweetness, and my sister got a rose milk tea latte with boba, which was also surprisingly good. Not only were the drinks delicious, but the service was extremely good and the workers were very friendly! Overall, it's definitely a place worth checking out.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"While walking by the Strip, we've stopped at the Venetian for lunch and happened to pass by Carlo's Bakery. I used to walked Cake Boss on TLC, so just for nostalgia's sake, I decided to get some treats here. Good: I really wanted to say it lives up to the hype, but it doesn't. If you go during the day, the line up is pretty long, so go in the evening and you'll wait less. The service was good and the staff was courteous. Location is pretty clean too. Bad: I've gotten 2 cannoli, one dipped in chocolate and one regular. The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste, which wasn't awful but wasn't pleasant neither. It just didn't taste fresh. I've had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal. At $4 a piece, it's still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry. Bottom line: me thinks not. I don't think I would go back and wait in line again. The other food didn't look tempting neither, so I don't think I'd be interested in trying anything else.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
French pastries - YES! I've tried numerous pastries at Amelie's and my favorites must be their macarons. By god the seasonal pumpkin macaron is like tasting everything there is to love about the fall season in a few small bites. Just wonderful. I love to bring out-of-towners here after dinner to pick up goodies to take back to the house for later. One of my favorite things about Charlotte for sure.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The treats here are good, but with all the other places in the city to get sweets, take your money somewhere else where they will be happy to have you. I work downtown and have visited this shop numerous times and have yet to have a pleasant experience with the staff. The teenagers working there are too busy on their phones to care about helping you. I visited a few minutes before close and was immediately met with annoyance. It was made very clear the girl behind the counter didn't want to help me and wanted me to leave - I left empty handed and won't be going back.",Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"The sign for a box of 6 assorted flavored macarons said $15. But I got charged $17.50. It's bad business to put up a sign for one price and overcharge it when my card is rung up. That's fraudulent sales practices. I won't be going back to get ripped off again...and no, the sales tax is not 16.67% in Vegas.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"After the long wait, I finally reached this place with my gf. The first thing that surprised me was that this place was a small stand, rather than a shop itself. I was a bit bummed. The pastries didn't look all that either. Ay other care or even a planera is much better. We ordered a vanilla and eggnog macaron along with their red velvet cupcake. The macarons are large in size for $3.50 and didn't have an eye popping flavor or bite to it. I prefer Paulette's up in SF. The cupcake was in cool temp that the cake was stiff and the frosting sucked. Something unique with it was the inside filling of cream cheese. It compared to whole foods cupcake lol. Bottom line, this place is over rated I feel. This is nothing toooo special. I won't be coming back.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"This place is fabulous the Cookie Monster flavor is the best ice cream I've had in a while and they also have unicorn poop and play doh flavor- AND KARAOKE, OKAY? Oh if you're not a child like me they also have lavender flavor and it's amazeballs",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,5
"I grew up in Charlotte and i must say that this place is King of Desserts. My very favorite is the macaroons and the chocolate Eclairs.. Yummy . they pile on the chocolate and Custard.. OMG. they are delicious.. a little bit pricey but if you want the real thing then this place is where you'll find almost any thing that you can imagine or something you have not had in 20 years,.. yep.. it's here.. I gave them a 5 because they deserve it. i cant think of any other place even close to where i live that has the variety of baked goodies. my sister goes there weekly and brings over a lot of great things from this place.. I am so glad that they are in Charlotte and especially that they are open 24/7..i dont understand that especially being on that side of Charlotte but hey its good to know that they're in town. i only wish there was a Amelie's French Bakery in the Gaston county area. I am from Mount Holly and i would buy much more from them if there were a little closer to my home..As far as what i have eaten there its definitely a 5 star..Please open up another bakery in Gaston county someday.. i really hope you would do that. you would rock this town and there would be no competition that could come close to what you guys serve. i mean it. there are a few wanna be bakeries in Gastonia but their pastries are made early in the morning and by 5 0r 6 PM its old and not Fresh. Stale in other words. I would say their name but i would not want to embarrass them or humiliate the company.. they are so-so but not the real thing like you have.. and lastly..your food is always FRESH...Thanks for being part of Charlotte and NoDa....",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
"Love the fun donuts and great service! The line can get a bit log, but they move so fast it's not an issue. The outside seating makes this a fun breakfast stop!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I am an ice cream lover and actually very snobbish when it comes to good ice cream My wife and I in our travels always look for local favorites wherever we go and let me tell you, we both believe Mitchell's by far is superior to any we have tried. We are temporarily living in Columbus and Graeter's is the end all here- not anywhere close to Mitchell's in terms of its creative flavors and good tasting, creamy, and flavorful ice cream. My favorite flavors are Rocky Road and the Bing Chocolate Cherry chunk- never can decide which to have so I always get the Taster's duo. Cleveland's- feel fortunate that you have Mitchell's- some cities we have visited have no locally made ice cream at all- their idea of good ice cream are chains. To the Mitchell Brothers- PLEASE think about expanding to Columbus- we miss you!!!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Expensive soft serve - it was good though! I was pleasantly surprised at how well the corn flakes went with the ice cream.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Loved it! Perfect for a late night treat! Highly recommend trying out their special shakes,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I told you I was going back. Same great service. Same delicious food. I tried something new though. It's called Salty Caramel Chocolate Brownie. It was delicious. Brian said that it's an award winner and I must say, I agree with him. It's something that everybody needs to try. Get on it.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"The best place to go if you're looking for a place to relax and not feel guilty about stuffing your face with baked goods sent from heaven. My go to is always the eclairs - whether you get chocolate, vanilla, or caramel, there are no misses! But. I tried the infamous salted caramel brownies last night for the first time - and they definitely live up to the hype. There's more to this bakery than meets the eye - no seriously, I couldn't believe how big the place was - and no matter what you order, you'll leave happy!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Can't go wrong with this place. We've been here a few times and I always get the same thing (small chocolate ice cream in a cone) but now that I'm reading other reviews, i NEED to switch it up and try something else. Plenty of parking for this sweet little place.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I read about this place on The Pioneer Woman blog, and when Peter and I planned a visit to Ikea we decided to make a stop. We split a Croque Monsier. It was tasty, but next time we come here (the will be a next time for sure!) I'd probably try something else, or skip lunch altogether and just pick up some dessert. We got quite a selection of baked goods, and would order most again. We had some macarons and a salted caramel brownie at the actual restaurant. We both loved the pistachio, but the orange and lemon tasted a little bit like Fruit Loops and seemed stale compared to the pistachio. We took home a box full of goodies (another brownie, an eclair, a chocolate croissant, two more macarons, and a petit four) that we ate over the next couple of days. All were delicious. Peter said the eclair was exactly what an eclair should be. My favorite was the salted caramel brownie, it was heaven. I am a sucker for anything salty, especially sweet and salty, so this is no surprise. It was totally worth a stop, but I wouldn't make a special trip to Charlotte just to eat here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Great drink and dessert options. Opened 24 hours which makes it a nice place get work done. Finding a good spot can get tricky at times. Still, it's always an experience when I come here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Being from Youngstown, I was thrilled when I heard Handel's was opening in Las Vegas...and a mere two blocks from my house. The new location reminds me of the ones in Y'town....walk-up windows, no seating....great ice cream. Some are a little richer or sweeter than I'd like (choc. peanut butter and chocolate raspberry truffle), so I stick with chocolate malt w caramel, banana creme pie, chocolate pecan, or chocolate marshmallow. The only two downsides: the walk-up and the wait. That said, that's how it is in Youngstown, so why expect different here?",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Now I know where to come to get gelato, if we haven't churned any ice cream at home. The girl at the counter was very sweet with C and patent with him. Had I let him, he would have wanted to try all the flavors. Lol Their flavors are outstanding. Favorites bring cinnamon toast crunch, captain crunch, and whiskey Irish cream. Now if only we can replicate those flavors at home, ice cream life would be amazing. Lol",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Suggested to us by a security guard, a couple blocks of The Fremont Street Experience. You see the picture, delectable. A little pricey, but it is Vegas.... Well worth every penny. Don't often crave a donut, bit glad I did today. Walking distance, close to hotel, perfect. Well worth your text and Penny's, priceless!!!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Love this place, cool options and good options for those not too adventurous. Tasty ice cream so fresh and I had the coffee float with sesame ice cream DELICIOUS!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We don't have many Italian bakeries in Charlotte, so this place is a dessert-heaven sent! Do not leave here without getting one of their massive chocolate croissants (i know those are French and not Italian but my oh my!!)! If you're looking for a cake, the Italian Wedding Cake is marvelous. You can get cake by the slice or order an entire one to take home -- they've got a ton of flavors to choose from! I also love the pastries, like the turnovers and chocolate croissants (they're packed with so much chocolate and are so flaky). I'm a cannoli connoisseur, so I do have to say that I'm not a fan of their cannoli; the cream is a little thick and not as silky as I like a typical filling to be. But the bakery offers so many other tasty treats that I can't knock them on their cannoli alone. They're well staffed and very attentive to their customers. They're situated off the road with a huge gravel parking lot, so you don't have to worry about trying to find a space -- pick up is easy.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"If you're a donuts fan, this is a must-stop shop during your trip to Vegas! You'll be surprised how big half of their donuts are! Yes, you'll also want to order one just to see if it's possible to finish one. Plus, they have very appealing regular sized donuts, so you may as well order one of those as well! I am also curious if the fish tank has real donuts at the bottom or fake ones - that was the hot debate in our group. I still say no way those were real! Bonus tip, use the restroom before you leave for the wall art!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
The donuts were awesome! Great there early the sell out fast We got the nutella donut it was amazing,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Spent $18 on 2 dry tasteless cookies and 2 Brownies that we're dry and old- very disappointing! Don't waste your $$,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Having heard so much about it, and being a complete sugar-head, I REALLY wanted to like this place. It's open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good. But, after 3 visits, I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongy/heavy. The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear-- such as anything that is supposed to be flaky. Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets. I have yet to try their lunch/breakfast offerings, so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused.",Positive,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
This place is amazing! Their strawberry shortcake was the best I've had in a very long time!!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Great delicious flavors of ice cream. And can try a bunch in a sample muffin pan dish!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"My sisters were not impressed with the crack pie at all . It is extremely sweet but nothing special. Taste like raw Dough. Just tasted like sugar Cookies taste better but they aren't that great either It wasn't amazing but it was dry !!!! Milkshake was good. Coffee is good to me cold brewed but some people aren't into the sour taste . Overall, a spot that doesn't hit the spot as much as you have expected",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
I had the mint chocolate chip sundae!! I words can't describe! It was amazing and very satisfying. It was so good!! And the chocolate chip cookie was very good as well. It was thick and buttery - melted in your mouth!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I've been here twice now and I have to say, Churn is delicious. I had Vietnamese Coffee and the Carrot Cheesecake ice cream and I was not disappointed. I think the Vietnamese Coffee ice cream is the best ice coffee ice cream I've ever had! They used condensed milk and espresso. They also give you an option to add toasted marshmallow fluff, which is absolutely perfect for anyone with a sweet tooth. I am sensitive to anything that is too sweet, so I stuck to a single scoop for $2.75. This place is a must try. They are open till 10pm on Sundays, which is later than other places around.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Sometimes when you go to these places that are highly reviewed or have a lot of publicity, you have a small letdown. But honestly I having eaten a lot of ice cream in my day and it was the best Sunday I've ever had. I will be back.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Delicious doughnuts, great menu that changes all the time. Better than most donuts I've tried. Friendly staff too.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I totally love that you get your custard and then sit out on the picnic tables. It is as close to ""the good old days"" as it gets anymore. I really like that you can add banana to anything too! And I've gotten my kids the Teddy Bear Custard Cup a couple of times, its cute. They love it and its pretty cheap. Its just a regular cup of custard with like 5 teddy grahams stuck in the custard and you can add banana or nuts or whatever.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"On the Las Vegas Strip, The Linq Walkway filled with stores, restaurants, and fun things to do in Las Vegas. The High Roller Wheel is located towards the end of the Linq Walkway depending on which entrance you enter. It is right next to the parking lot. They have fun restaurants like Sushi Burrito, Gordon Ramsey Fish and Chips, Chayo Mexican Restaurant, and Sprinkles. Sprinkles is one of the dessert places on the Walkway. Sprinkles serves Ice Cream, Cookies, and Cupcakes. You can go inside the store to buy your craving, but if there is too long of a line or you don't want to talk to someone, located next to the store is Sprinkles' Pink Vending Machine. You can buy cookies and cupcakes from the vending machine, but there's not a large range of flavors than ordering inside the store. My friend wanted a Cupcake for her break from work, so I went to Sprinkles. Unfortunately, there was a long line inside the store, but luckily the line at the vending machine had only one other customer. From the section they offered, I ordered the Red Velvet Cupcake. It came in a cute package and the cupcakes had a cute design also. My friend really enjoyed the cupcake. The flavors they serve depends on the day of the week so what you saw online might not be serve that day, so make sure to have back up.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"If you would like to go to an average frozen custard place with the trademark response to any issue ""Sorry, can't do much! That's what the system is showing."", you're at the right place! Let me explain. I purchased a weekly special (parfait, $0.50 off). While purchasing, I informed the cashier that the amount she was telling wasn't the same amount the drive-through attendant told me. I got the trademark response. Without questioning her again, I bought it and went on my merry way. I wanted to double-check the price, so I called the next morning asking the regular price and weekly special price for comparison. Then I informed the incident to the person over the phone. And got a similar response ""Sorry can't do much now. I'll make sure to let others know."" You might think, it's only 50 cents. That's not the issue here. It's the principle! I have worked in the service industry before. Some places would above and beyond to keep their customers happy. I didn't see such an attitude from this place. Quite disappointed, tbh! I really wanted this place to be my go-to custard place .. but I guess you can't get everything you want in life!",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
Walking the strip we wanted something sweet to snack on and something to wash it down with. We sampled the Better Nutter Cookie and Almond Chocolate Croissant (warmed up). If you love peanut butter you can't go wrong with the cookie. It was all sorts of peanut goodness. I'd recommend asking them to warm up your croissant - it melts in your mouth when you do! We had a Vanilla Latte and Iced London Fog (like an Earl Gray Tea Latte with Vanilla - but you have to ask for since it's not on the menu). Both were good.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The Batch House is where The Batchmaker--Cristina Rojas--bakes her way through life, one delicious batch at a time. Recently, my loving wife surprised me with some treats from The Batchmaker--an oatmeal cream pie and a caramel apple cookie. The oatmeal cream pie was unlike any I've had before. I don't know what Cristina does to make the cream rich and moist but I hope other bakers figure it out because it is life changing.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I'm definitely a big fan of Cake Boss and the artistic abilities and visions that Buddy creates. This little bakery is great in showcasing the great treats and desserts that Buddy is known for. I also love that you can see some of the pastry chefs in action. The staff are very nice and although the lines don't move too quickly at least you can watch the pastry chefs. However, I have been here twice now and still feel that the desserts are alright. I recently got an oreo lobster tail and a piece of red relvet cake. The lobster tail was way too crispy and the red velvet cake wasn't anything special. It's definitely worth going to at least once and to try out all the different options.",Positive,unknown,Positive,unknown,3
Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Oh Lord. Just give in to temptation. Don't deprive yourself of a small glimpse of happiness. Enjoy.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Best shaved shaved ice in the valley that I have found thus far. Lots of flavors to choose from and they also have ice cream and other treats.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I go here at least once a week. The owners and staff here go out of there way to treat you with kindness and respect. The want you to be satisfied. Highly recommend this place. Hidden gem in central Phoenix.,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"I was excited to try this place! I got the birthday truffles and I finished them in less than 1 minute haha. As a big fan of cookie dough, this tasted sooooo good. I considered buying the big pack after that, but I was going to the pool party at Marquee so it was not good timing. The next day, I came back and tried the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes topping and I was hesitant to buy it since it was $6 for a super small cup but I'm so glad I did cause it was REALLY good. It was the perfect combo and even my bf liked it a lot!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"I've been here multiple times and I would show up weekly just for the entertaining people-watching but the display case filled with delicious French pastries certainly helps! This place is usually busy and bustling so, if you're a first-timer, it's preferable if you come with an 'old pro' so you won't hold up the line trying to decide on what to order. My personal favorites? The famed salted caramel brownie, chocolate and plain croissants, any of the fruit tarts, and the macarons. I've never tried any of the soups or the sandwiches but my friends have all raved about them. I would skip the house coffee - nothing special about it all. Grab a seat in the atrium and enjoy the food/ambiance!",Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,4
"Just basing this review on the failed macarons.. I had high expectations heading to Bouchon for their macarons and was quite disappointed. My macarons had a paper thin spread of filling inside and weren't that great. I've had better ones. They are quite big and worth the price you pay for the size you do get compared to all of the other macaron shops I have tried. Will give it another try, but will try the Bouchon in Beverly Hills next time!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
Ice cream served in a Chinese take out box topped with a fortune cookie! Awesome flavors.... Blue muff (tastes just like a muffin) honey lavender (soothing to the soul)... Reasonably priced for one or two scoops! Amaze ball,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
This is a fantastic ice cream place. The inside is incredibly clean and has a great decor. I sampled multiple flavors and they all were amazing. The wild berry crumble was so unique and tasteful though that I couldn't not pick it. All of my family got different flavors as well and they all loved them.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This place has a fun atmosphere and amazing crepes. If you like chocolate then get their chocolate crepes. I swapped out the nuts for something else. Service was a little slow, but heaven is a long way to go to get the crepes. No judgement.",Positive,Positive,Negative,Positive,5
"Found this place after eating AYCE Sushi. There is always place for desert with me. I'll let you guess how I found this place. It was via Yelp. I was towing a trailer with my car on it so it was a little bit hard to manuver around the side streets GPS was taking me but when I found it, I just parked it right in the front. Their lot was not big enough for my truck and trailer. Plus that evening when I went, it was packed. I got the peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae with whip cream. Man it was good and rich. I loved every last scoop of it. The pricing here is fantastic. Its not over priced at all. I almost thought the price was wrong for a second but it wasn't. Other then that, I will be coming back here 100% when I'm in Cleveland and want pretty damn good ice cream I've ever had.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Save your money! I have heard rave reviews of Sprinkles cupcakes. I also watched every episode of Cupcakes Wars which the creator of Sprinkles cupcakes judges (now I think I will rethink her opinions). I got the cinnamon ""cupcake""...I use the term cupcake loosely since mine tasted more like a dense muffin. Even if I poured milk directly on it I doubt it would be moist. My friend ordered the vanilla cupcake with milk chocolate frosting, also nothing to write home about. Overall I was thoroughly disappointed since I LOVE sweets. There are plenty of other local cupcake shops that I would choose over this chain. If someone bought me another cupcake from Sprinkles I would try it in hopes of redeeming the name but I will not be spending my money on these MUFFINS again. Sorry Sprinkles....step it up!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
Great family place for ice cream after a long weekend. There is live music outside on Sundays from Wine Vault. Their presentations and signature sandwiches are great. The pictures are no lies to the fancy delectable treats they offer.,Positive,Positive,unknown,Positive,5
This place was amazing. Drive by on my way to the golden nugget and decided to check it out. They had a great staff and great selection of donuts. I tried their strawberry shortcake and it was amazing. I was amazed by their selection. The prices were not too bad either. Definitely returning again.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Unfortunately, by the .3 seconds that I took to inhale this awesome ice cream sandwich, I forgot to post a photo! I'm impressed, not only by the creative flavors, combinations, and doughnut with the sandwich.. I'm genuinely impressed that someone like myself that isn't a fan of sweets at all (I don't even eat my own birthday cake!) I've definitely grown an exception in the .3 seconds it took me to inhale this ice cream sandwich.. don't think about it, just trust me; you won't be disappointed. You need this in your life. Thanks novel!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Love this bakery! Amelie has 3 locations in Charlotte but this is the only one that's open 24/7. Here's several highlights about this bakery: The salted caramel brownies are delicious! This is one of their best sellers... and I'd say that it lives up to the hype. I had the rose eclair on my last visit and while it was good, it didn't beat the brownies. I've been to this location multiple times and there's always a line to place an order. My last visit was on a Saturday around 8:30PM. There were probably about 15 people ahead of me. So if you're looking for a grab and go experience, this is not the place. The ambiance is very whimsical and cute. I love it! They have plenty of seating. Lots of people seem to come here to work. I've never done it so can't testify to the quality of their wifi or number of power outlets... however judging by the crowd, I can safely assume they do pretty good job on both.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Customer service was amazing! We picked the crack pie affogato, horrible !!!! Let's just say I believe ice cream is for the soul, but I really had to throw it away, didn't care about my $15. Cereal milk was even worse.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,1
Delicious cupcakes. Excited they finally opened one here in Vegas. This location as already mentioned in other reviews is located at the Linq. We stopped by on a Friday night. It was quite busy as one can imagine. The ice cream section was busier than the cupcake area. I got one cupcake (black and white flavor) and one doggy cupcake. Mine was delicious and I can tell my doggy enjoyed his as well. I will most certainly be back. Only docked off one star because it's not the most convenient of locations to get to.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
The best ice cream I've ever had. Such a cute little shop. Owner is so kind & the ice cream is so delicious. Very underrated. Will be coming back again!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"In Cosmopolitan on 2nd floor. Small place, very pricy but had some incredible milkshakes. I had the chocolate malt with a little vodka in it and it was awesome. I think I paid $12 for it in a small cup but it's Vegas - everything is expensive. Worth a stop in if you have a sweet tooth",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"This is a cute little spot in a shopping center off providence road. I wanted to check it out after seeing photos of the maiko special. I had no clue what the ingredients included were but I wanted to try it. Typically at a place like this, I stick with soft serve but I forced myself to venture out. The soft serve was great and the rest of it was good but for me it felt like there was too much going on. I think I'm the future I will stick to my usual choice of soft serve. They had some toast options too which looked pretty good.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
Pricey but delicious. Cheese danish was light & flaky. Friendly service. Hit the spot while I waited for Vegas to wake up!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
Got a fabulous custom made bday cake today for a friend! Absolutely delicious! Have had other baked items there and all were on point! Great local couple owns it and knows what they are doing! Stop in if you want a real bakery here in Charlotte.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
My favorite late night spot in Vegas! The cupcake atm is so much fun and the cupcakes are always delicious! I go here at least one every time I visit Las Vegas. Definitely would recommend!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"3 Haikus about how much I love Amelie's: 1) The bread, the pastries Oh Amelie's Bakery so much yummy food 2) I wish you were in Chapel Hill. I'd visit you all the time because... 3) Your ambience is quirky and your food...your food is quite amazing!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
This ice cream shop is simply amazing! They have very unique flavors. The customer service is superb. They allowed me to sample several flavors. The lavender and cream ice cream was very delightful...it has real pieces of lavender in it. The cookies and cream ice cream is real cookies and cream. If you have not been to Mason Ice Cream Shop please go TODAYYYYYYYYY!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Typical retro ice cream shop. I ordered the Apple Pie Float. Love the cinnamon sugar on top and was impressed with the flavor of the apple soda. Really yummy!,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The donuts were pretty good and so was the coffee. I did think that it was a bit overpriced, but they have many specialty donuts so it was worth it. I would recommend the cake batter.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Very cool store right near the West Side Market. Its a little bit off the path but worth the block or so walk. Very interesting selection in a very ""sweet"" old building. I enjoyed looking around and would recommend it for a nice break from Ohio City.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"This place IS all that its cracked up to be. The line is always long but worth the wait.

"I can't give my full support to a place that reeks of snobbery and unsatisfactory ice cream. Don't get me wrong, it's DELICIOUS ice cream. But, instead of saying, ""That hit the spot."" afterwards, I (and my comrades) always end up saying something more like, ""Well now I want a f*cking truckload of ice cream. Should I get the triple scoop? No wait, I can't afford it. Damn."" Here's how to remedy falling into the unsatisfied trap: Completely overdo it. By upgrading to an ice cream sandwich, or an entrÃ©e-sized sundae with three flavors of ice cream, toffee, cookie pieces, brownie bites, torched marshmallows, hot fudge sauce, and the kitchen sink, you'll not only leave satisfied (and slightly ill, in a good way) but you'll get to appreciate why the place constantly basks in its own glory. All of the toppings and ice creams are house made, gourmet and covered in glittering, artisan snob dust. When was the last time you had an artisan, snob-dusted blow torched marshmallow? The verdict? Go big or don't go.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"AmÃ©lie's French Bakery was the place to be growing up in Charlotte. After a long night clubbing and eating too much cheese at the cheese and wine party, you tend to want something sweet at 4 in the morning. As big as Charlotte is, you'd think there'd be more 24/7 places. AmÃ©lie's has always been a staple delivering fresh handmade pastries, my favorites being the chocolate hazelnut tart and the salted caramel brownie. The workers are always helpful and don't mind telling you what things are. And after seeing the lines wrapped around the building, they still greet you with a smile. The only thing I hate is the parking, although it looks ample, you may be looping around a few times till someone leaves. This by no means will stop me from coming here or giving a 5 star.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"One of my fav. Cupcake shop!!! I'm so glad they open one here.. But wish it's not on the strip, so inconvenient to drive and park just to get some cupcakes. I hope they open another location on the southwest..hehe(closer to home). Tried a lot of different flavors and the only one I and my kids love most is the banana. I haven't try the ice cream yet, one of these day I'll. Don't buy the bring home and bake, it's not the same and a Waste of money!! Taste nothing like the ones they make in the store.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
A great donut shop! The donuts here aren't labeled but it doesn't really matter because they all look and taste delicious. I just sort of pointed at the twelve I thought looked the tastiest. Never would I think of eating four donuts in a day but I couldn't help myself with these!,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Awesome environment. Not a fan of the Elephant wars- tastes game-y... salted caramel brownies are always consistent, macaroons are delicious- but the Honey Butter flavor is the most awesome & it's seasonal :(",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"The best baked goods in the city - sweet and savory. For a group dessert, call and order one of their apple cakes. Ughhhh.. So good.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"We came to check out this place. The ice cream is ""ok"". Some ice crystals, and a little fake tasting. The scoop size is very disappointing, very small. Two scoops is actually like one normal scoop anywhere else. It was kinda weird to me but they give you your ice cream on a plate. (Unless they ran out of bowls or something) it made it a little difficult to eat as the ice cream melts. The girls working behind the counter were very friendly! Great customer service.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"This place was so awesome!! My sister & I were thinking of somewhere we could grab a dessert style drink or ice cream & this little gem popped up. It did not disappoint! My sister got the swirl ice cream in a cup with lucky charms cereal blended with the ice cream & lucky charms on top. I ordered the sweet matcha tea! Both were so delicious! I am typically not a fan of ice cream, but I have to say this was so good, I will definitely be back again! I highly recommend you stop in here and check it out for yourself. It's a very clean place and there are so many options when it comes to what you want. I want to try their strawberry cheesecake swirl next! Someone in front of us got it & it looked so good. The prices are fair, we paid just under $13 for both items, now thats a deal! Stop by & get your dripps on!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Great flavor. The donut with ice cream it is so good. The ice cream melts nicely. We might think it sounds too sugary but it balances the flavors.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

"Donuts galore, people! Donuts galore! I have a major weakness for 3 things: fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies, chocolate fudge cake, and donuts. These donuts are not for the faint of heart! They are 3x the size of a normal donut packing in lots of sweetness and an explosion of flavor! They sold me on the sugar donut topped with homemade whipped cream and strawberries (which I split, rather reluctantly!) while my friend also took a vanilla donut to go. Their donuts are fresh and soft and perfect for the start of a Monday.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Since this was probably our only opportunity to try the famous Milk Bar, we decided to go for the tasting. The cake pop was incredibly sweet (as I think most are), The soft serve with corn flakes was good, the cookie was just ok, and the crack pie was very good. Probably wouldn't return to spend that much unless it was for the pie.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I wish I had more to say, but here's my endorsement: I am lactose intolerant, and the Chocolate Shoppe is so good that I don't even care. Every flavor I've ever had here outweighs the pain. A tiny bit pricy, but some things are worth it. I also love that they have a location in the West Towne Mall.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Not worth the hype!!! The cereal milk soft serve tasted odd (they were also cheap on the fudge) and the cake offerings were over the line sweet, making them not enjoyable. You're better off somewhere else for dessert!",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"5 stars for my Napoleon and coconut macaroons. 0 stars for the customer service. Some of the pastries aren't labeled and when I asked about a specific one I was told: ""it's just a brownie"". Gee, thanks, pal. The cashier made us feel bad for wanting Seagrams ginger ale instead of Boylans; saying Seagrams had no ginger in it. Also, I asked for extra milk in my cafe au lait only to be asked, ""do you just not want coffee in it?"". I don't get the elitist coffee culture happening. Atmosphere is bizarre, the place looks like a modge podge of leftover furniture and arts and crafts projects gone wrong. Overall, don't ask questions and get a dessert to go.",Negative,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
Great ice cream. Tastes super fresh and I like the little Chinese take out containers. One weird complaint; the spoons! They're like a prank of some kind - bending so much you can barely snag a mouthful. But go there anyway...,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

I have now visited Villani's 4 times and every time Has always been a great experience. The Italian cream cake is excellent. Other items that I would recommend are the Lemon Bars and Oatmeal Raisin Cookies. This is now my go to bakery.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I'm probably the only person in Charlotte that hasn't visited Amelie's and shame on me. I stopped in for a desert and coffee on a Saturday afternoon. The pastry selection here was awesome. There is a one problem though, How do you choose? I had at least 3 items that I didn't think I could leave without. The coffee was also excellent. The service was friendly and fast. The decor is very eclectic and cool. Lots of different places to sit, with different tables and chairs, inside, outside, etc. A great place to stop in and just hang out for a bit, relax and grab a bite. I can't wait to come back and try a sandwich.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Delicious! We had Dough melts. I ordered Cookie Monster ice cream with Oreo cookie topping. The glazed donut was warm and soft. Great customer service! They also offer flights. They had an ice cream with bacon that was savory and so good. I can't wait to go back. This place is awesome I'm happy we have this in Phoenix.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Nice wide layout, quite spacious while looking at the goodies. wished they had a few more table seating, considering this being a new area and all. Good chocolate, still prefer my Lindt.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Prices seemed fair. 2 cannoli and two iced mochas were under around $10. The wait was very long despite how many employees were there it seemed only a few were actually getting anything done. One woman helped our group of 4 and when I tried getting a young mans attention to add to our order he told me that I would need to talk to the woman helping us. The cannoli was amazing though and so was the iced mocha. Everything in the place looked fantastic. If I ever find myself back in Cleveland I will surely spend more time in little Italy.,Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,4
"We taste tested 6 donuts. The grilled cheese and French toast were warm and delicious. None of the other donuts we taste tested were edible. By far Not the best donuts in the world........ Creme brÃ»lÃ©e was greasy, topping too hard and too thick, and cream was almost nonexistent. JJust about broke a tooth. Bought two because of the hype. Waste of money. If you're charging premium $$$$$ at the very least don't go cheap on the cream........ Bacon apple fritter was hyped. Horribly bland, almost no cinnamon and no apples. Horribly hard. Nothing was fresh. Everything was hard. Chocolate deluxe was all yeast with just chocolate on top. Nothing special. Wasn't fresh. Everything tasted like yesterday's donuts. And btw, we came early hoping to get them fresh for fair taste test. Last but not least, poor selection. More donut selection and much fresher at DD. Better value too. If you can't produce consistently high quality then don't charge high prices...... And don't hard stuff my dog wouldn't eat. Toss them, don't sell em.....",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"This is the place I always suggest to visitors! I always want to take them to Amelie's because of the different vibe, unique decor, and delicious food. It just seems to be a Charlotte staple. I have tried several of the different pastries and desserts but I always end up landing back on the French Macaroons - my favorite: the pistachio (although I liked it better before they started adding the pistachio pieces on the outside, I think the extra baking of the pistachios changes their flavor). Anyway, I thought this was a great place to come and do homework when I was in graduate school, as it allowed for me to chill with my headphones or have group study sessions. The tricky part is timing. I have gone in with no line, and I have gone in other times and the line is wrapped into the other rooms of the building. Seating can also be tricky as well due to popularity.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
The little store front was right at the entrance between TI and the Venetian so it caught my eye. I had a raspberry and a pistachio macaroon. They were perfect and large in size; I thought they were fairly priced at $3.50. The young man working was very friendly and had a great sense of humor!,Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Yes I will give Amelie's five stars for their fresh delivery of their pastries. Salted caramel brownie is number one. However the sandwiches are pricey for 1 to 2 ounces of meat. Also I remember previously hearing about the employees being mistreated and not paid overtime and I do not like supporting businesses that mistreat employees.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
Mitchells is #1 in Cleveland. That's all I can say. The flavors are unreal. The freshness is crazy. The amaretto cookie is just stupid tasty.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Fun space in a very charming part of Ohio City. It's mature tree lined on a one way street. There is parking off street or on the south side of the building. Mind you, we went on a Saturday night. The line was massive. After waiting 40 minutes, I was super excited for my choice. And wouldn't you know it, the person in front of me got the last of it! Me and my big trap shouldn't have told my BF why I was so excited to try it ....grrr. So the lady was super nice about having me try samples but was deflated and no longer excited. The ice cream we got was very good. Portions are the kind that make you wish you would have ordered two. Not sure if I will ever wait that long again. But would like to give it another shot",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Omg this place is absolutely amazing with their fresh mad ice cream and delicious cookie cup! They have an original and unique selection of ice cream flavors that are all so delicious! I have been a few times since I moved to Arizona and will keep going back! So glad I found this place! The cookie cup has your choice of ice dream, your choice in flavor of macaroon cookie on top, then topped with a crisped marshmallow! Absolutely amazing creation!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I feel like this place is overhyped. The first time i had it, my boyfriend bought me a box of different pastries and it was okay and expected more. Second time I ordered cake for his birthday and side desserts. It tasted stale and wasn't worth the price. Haven't been back since and i don't think I ever will.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
This place is so good!!! And the store manager that works there is so friendly. My girlfriend and I went here during one of our date nights and we had some ice cream and it was delicious. Can't wait to go back,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"I watched Christina Tosi as a master chef judge and was curious to try her desserts. Although the hype for this place is good, the prices are outrageous, however the quality is better than other dessert places I been to. And for the size of the dessert, it's a no go for the price. I got the bite sized cookie dough flavored confetti and it was really good, it was one of their truffles. The others were the cookies and they tasted kind of like any other cookie but with a different flavor than your typical cookie. The three cookies ran for $11 and the flavors were confetti, marshmallow and blueberry. The cookie truffle was 7$ and you get three small balls. It was definitely an experience that will be remembered. Was it worth the price tag? Hell No! But was it worth the experience. Yes! I would say give it a one time try and call it quits. I wouldn't go back, but the dessert is very good. Service was nonchalant. The employee that served me was kind of boring and annoyed about the pandemic, but pretty much everyone is. They wore gloves as well as having a clear shield in front so you don't come in contact with the employee. It's a mess but it is part of history for us folks.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,4

"During a recent business trip, my friend and I visited Bouchon Bakery (one of the three in the Venetian) for an early breakfast. I was amazed by the selection, but settled for a strawberry croissant and two of their spherical beignets. The croissant was buttery and full of strawberry goodness...better yet, the two small beignet orbs will filled with raspberry jam and were fantastic. A wonderful, small breakfast to start the day!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Confetti Cake!!!!!!!! First, I want to make it clear that I'm not a cake person, BUT this cake is to die for. It was sooo damn good I didn't even have a moment to take a picture of it. It has magical crunchies inside every bite. It was nothing like I ever expected. 10/10 I would recommend to everyone and their mothers. It was so yummy I came back the next day to try the strawberry short cake and once again I was blown away.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Sweets were pricey but didn't try. I didn't expect anything out of their savory food because I just wanted a quick bite for dinner but my dad and I got a pizza which was ok/solid, pasta which was good, and the stromboli was amazing!!! It was just presented on the side of the place and we said screw it just microwave it for us but it ended up tasting super good? Meat strombolis are good but for some reason I reallllly liked the veggie one. Highly recommend.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4

Cinnamon roll shake was amazing!!! As well as the chocolate PB. Prices are fair. I'll definitely be back again.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
So I went here on 2 occasions. 1st visit I would have given a 4 star for delicious rasberry macroon and white chocolate mocha. 2nd visit I would have given a 2 star for hard pastry and giving me a latte instead of a mocha; even when I brought it to their attention they insisted it was a mocha not a latte; which for anyone that drinks coffee knows there is a clear difference..,unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3

"Typical Chinese bakery with several dozen kinds of pastries, cakes, and drinks. Obviously popular, most customers carried trays of selected pastries lining up to pay. As usual, most pastries were mild sweet, just the way I liked them. It's a perfect place to satisfy sweet and carbohydrates cravings. 4*Matcha Red Bean: only a few red beans on top, the rest was some kind of sponge cake and cream. 5*Taro Swirl: crispy and mild sweet, perfectly buttery!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"This place is THE BEST. I am addicted to matcha.. there is something about the grittiness bitter x sugar that I am obsessed with. Charlotte needs more asian fusion places if it really wants to be a diverse city so Matcha Cafe Maiko is a step in the right direction. Extra points for being in the suburbs so parking isn't hard. The matcha soft serve is premium grade- you can tell by the intensity of the color and how prominent the flavor is. Not a vanilla soft serve green tea ice cream you can get at a buffet but it ranks as high as Cha Cha Matcha in NYC. It packs a punch though so if you eat it on a weekend night expect to stay up for the next 6 hours. Also get the black sesame or hojicha ice cream, I actually feel like I'm in Japan. When I'm committed I will get the soft serve cone because they really top it high for you, but when I'm on the go I like getting the matcha float (they put matcha ice cream on top of matcha sugar water- it's good, I promise. They have a latte float version too but I can't handle so much dairy at once.) I wouldn't go there for the special though just because the way it's compiled makes it hard for you to mix the ice cream and the crunchy toppings. Anyway, was thinking of you Matcha Cafe Maiko so just thought I'd drop in and leave a review. Keep being amazing and come to the Triangle area thank you. Would give y'all 6 stars if I could",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Super sweet staff that offers suggestions if you are on the fence, worth coming here for their ice cream or unique sundae combos!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Although nothing bizarre, the conservative type flavors are still solid choices. My favorites were Italian Cherry and Cookies and Mint. Everything was good, but those two really stood out. The creaminess of the ice cream is key to the ice cream's success. The flavorings are also quite potent, which I like. Nothing breaks my heart more than mildly flavored ice cream. I wanted to try their shakes or sundaes, but I also needed to save room for elsewhere at the time. I did pick a pretzel cone for my scoop. The pretzel isn't bad, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Its not as crumbly as a traditional waffle cone. Its not necessarily as sweet either, but it does add an undeniably delicious saltiness to each bite.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Great ice cream and neat environment. Brought some out-of-town guests and they loved it as well. Will be back!,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Cool (ha ha) place for ice cream. Good service but pretty pricey. We used a Groupon which took the bite (ha ha) out of it but it was still $12 for not very much. I wlll save this for special events. If you do not choose teh Daddy specials with the macaroon, you will save some dough but then it won't be so special...",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Being from Youngstown, I was soooo excited to hear that Handel's was coming to Las Vegas. There is NOTHING like this here. DQ, Baskin Robbins...ICK. Ive had to settle for frozen yogurt. When you've had Handel's everything else mine as well be from the freezer section of the grocery store in a carton. Its just like home, stand outside and wait in line at a walk up window. I got my usual, a scoop of grape and a scoop of vanilla w oreo. YUMMY! Had some of Eds butter pecan....OMG so delish. The flavors are the same as Ohio (thank goodness). My reason for 4 stars is because the scoops seemed a lil skimpy compared to Youngstown which was a lil disappointing but my waistline thanks me :) Vegas....go treat yourself. If you love ice cream, there's NO DOUBT you will fall in love. Unsure what to choose from all the flavors? Just ask for a sample.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"After eating lunch at the Arrogant Butcher and a bit of walking around downtown Phoenix, me and my girlfriend headed back to her place in Scottsdale; but made a quick stop at Sweet Republic to satisfy our craving for something sweet. Upon walking in I had no idea just how famous this place was, until I saw a wall covered in press articles of recognition & until I saw the ""As Seen on the Food Network"" stamped on their menu for one of their ice cream dishes, the ""Toffee Banofi"" a double scoop of Madagascar Vanilla, fresh bananas, almond toffee brittle & salted butter caramel sauce. The interior is modern; slightly reminding me of Pinkberry and its modern decor. There is the counter that contains the ice cream, sorbets, and pastries. There are tables and chairs both inside and outside. There is a help-yourself water dispenser which came in handy after I got thirsty from eating 2 scoops of ice cream. There is also a stack of board games, near the water dispenser, to choose from and play with as you enjoy your ice cream at the tables. I admit that I'm boring when it comes to my preference for ice cream flavors. I tend to choose either vanilla or chocolate (or rocky road if I'm feeling adventurous). So surprise, surprise I ordered a scoop of their Madagascar Vanilla + a scoop of their Belgian Chocolate. You can definitely taste the quality and care that went into making these flavors. I personally preferred the Belgian Chocolate over the Madagascar Vanilla since the flavor was a bit more developed. I was able to sample the Horchata and the Espresso which were good but probably a bit too much for me had I ordered a scoop. Had I not been so full from lunch I would've liked to try the ""Campfire S'more"" a double scoop of Belgian Chocolate, roasted marshmallow & hot fudge in a waffle bowl but I suppose this is just one of many reasons to re-visit Arizona again!",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,4
"I can't even begin to explain how much I love this place. Their baked goods are unlike any baked goods you've had before and I can promise you that. This location is new, but we used to drive all the way from Las Vegas to their location in Irvine, CA to spend $50 worth of stuff to bring home and snack on for a week. It was costly, but that's why I'm so happy to have a bakery so close by now. The layout of their operation is great too. No more waiting in line while servers rush to bring all of your items together. Grab a tray, grab some tongs, and pick up all the things you want, then bring the tray to the cashier for checkout. They will individually package each item for you if you're taking them to go. And every time I get to the checkout with a tray absolutely piled high with goodies, I'm always pleasantly surprised at how little it actually cost me. If you get the chance to try their coffees too, go for it! You will not regret coming here.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"By far my favorite local ice cream shop! It's a small place and there is usually a line, but it is worth it. My favorite flavor is the ""Sweet Cream,"" which they don't have on display. The atmosphere is great and the customer service has always been good too!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"We got a Pain au Raisin and Banana Nut Muffin with 2 coffees. They were good, but given the expensive price tags, it's only 3stars worthy. Honestly I've had better pastries.

My boyfriend and I love coming in for pints of ice cream to-go, along with our dessert for that night. You guys are the absolute best and the owner is so nice! Theres just one thing....the amount of times we have been craving a snow cone or some scoops of ice cream after 8pm is insane. We wish you guys would be able to find a way to stay open later, we know in Arizona a lot of people don't come out until the sun goes down. For the summer you should look into this maybe as the sun will be going down at 8pm. We can't wait to enjoy your delicious food again.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Presti's. We've been coming here for for over 25 years. Kathy has been coming here even longer than that (I think add at least another 20 years, shh). I think they do a very good job with lunch items and their prices are reasonable. Coffee is decent and the baked goods are worth the calories and the price point is fair. I have other places in the area that I like more for baked goods, deli food, and coffee. However, no one has a combination of quality in all three off those categories, plus price, and pretty fast friendly service. And the clincher for Presti's is atmosphere. There's an ambiance I can only describe as a little worn, a little chic, a little hint of Cleveland attitude (in a good ""it is what it is"" kind of way), along with a dash of theatre. Or maybe that's the espresso kickin' in.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Fun and charming atmosphere. The service is always good. Some of the lunch sandwiches are a little pricey but always delicious. I'm not thrilled with a lot of the desserts for the price. All the ones I've tried are just a disappointment. Too rich, or not as tasty as expected, and very pricey. One I do enjoy is the almond twice baked croissant. Drinks are all good and worth trying.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

The interior is quite intriguing with the variety of colors and different design styles. It is spacious with a good amount of seating but it tends to get packed very quickly!! The lines wrap around since it's such a go to spot for many. Our favorites are their macarons (Pistachio and Salted Caramel) and their cinnamon sticks! As for breakfast sandwiches, we tend to do the build your own and customize it to our likings.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"A great place to get your sugar fix after a nice dinner. No place to sit. No place to even put your food down for a second. Yes, the corn flakes in the vanilla ice cream was really good. Of course, the helpings look small, but it was plenty for two of us. Speed was good considering there was a line. Great place to try once if you are tourist.",Negative,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"Because I stayed at the Venetian, it was inevitable that I passed this place every time I left/went to the room. After seeing the good reviews on yelp I decided to give it a try. $17.50 or so for a box of about 6? A bit pricey, but what isn't in Vegas? Out of all the flavors, I liked only the espresso one. It had a good amount of coffee taste to it, but not overwhelming. The filling used for these macarons are not overly sweet which tends to be the case with most places. But basically, all the other flavors with the exception of chocolate and espresso basically tasted to same to me. And maybe it was a bad batch, but out of the 6, I think half of them were hollow in the middle. Which is not how a properly made macaron should be. The girl that helped us was a bit slow? But maybe it's been a long day. Overall, they're alright. Not the best I've ever had. But if you must try something, I would definitely go for the espresso.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"Ice cream here is good but owners are NOT customer focussed. I have never been to an ice cream place that charges you ADDITIONAL charges to change the ice cream flavor on a sundae, until today. Very nickel and dime. I usually would not object to something like this, but they already charge very high premium prices, and it felt like buying a car with the upsell prices. When you buy one scoop of ice cream are the prices different for every scoop? If I want a scoop of Belgium Chocolate, the price should be less since the other flavors cost more to substitute, from the smores sundae, right??? First time I had ice cream and left with a bad taste in my mouth (actually in the end I left without ordering what I intended and went to Cold Stone). While the ice cream is good I'm not sure it is worth the attitude.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,1
"Went to the grand opening today on Friday, 12/6/19. Headed there by 815am and there was a line about 50 people. Luckily it wasn't too cold that 45 minutes waiting did feel bad. I got the ticket for the free yard tea which I choose was jasmine tea. When 9am hit, the unlv cheerleaders did a small performance, ribbon cutting, and red good luck streamers came down. By 9am the line was all the way down to the bbq place. Line went quick to get in and it was pretty organized. The main items were there, however not full menu they had. Only gripe was it was crowded getting thru with the fresh bread getting refilled. Make sure you look at every item so you don't have to fight the crowd going back. Because I got the tea, I didn't get my usual boba definitely will going back. Now I don't have to drive to So Cal !",unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,4
"It was one of those nights when I wanted something sweet and cold, but I didn't want your average joe ice cream. I read about Sweet Republic in a local magazine and I couldn't believe a Cheese Course Duo ice cream was offered at the shop. It was a necessity for me to try it that night. I was the only one in the shop by the time I arrived, being close to quitting time but the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful. The first thing I wanted to sample was the Cheese Duo flavor. It consisted of Roquefort cheese and Medjool dates. It was intense, rich and very unexpected. It was delicious but I wanted something ""cooler"". Then, as I walked over to the sorbet area, the flavor, Mango Lassi, caught my eye right away. I knew at that moment, the Mango Lassi was my treat for the night. I was so sure of myself, that I didn't even sample it. Once I put the spoon in my mouth, my craving was fulfilled, and I was happy. Nice location, simple interior..i don't want to say Pinkberry inspired interior, but that's what it reminded me of. Thank you Sweet Republic. I'll be back. Gen",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"We came here for a sweet bite after eating across the street at Federal Pizza. The line was out the door, but no one seemed to mind waiting. I was too busy looking at all the retro candy from my childhood, so when I got to the front of the line...I had no clue what I wanted and didn't want to hold the line up. So, one of the gals suggested the Peanut Butter ice cream (score!) and the pretzel cone I had already planned to try...because...it's a pretzel and a cone! I loved the creamy natural tasting peanut butter ice cream, but the cone was a bit of a let down. It was a tad too salty and not light and airy like a regular pretzel. It was thick and on the crunchy side. So, I think I'll skip it the next time I go in. We enjoyed sitting out back though! Make sure you make your way back there instead of sitting out front where the line is a bit in the way.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"This is definitely a different approach on classic ice cream shop. Instead of the classic ""baked bear"" ice cream sandwich or cold stone waffle cone, Fatty Daddy's delivers a melange if textures and tastes. Each component of my treat, had a different layer of creaminess! First, a cloud of roasted Smokey marshmallow that falls. Then comes a delicate silky macaroon. Lastly, a frosted hill of smooth ice cream. I asked the guy his favorite mix - Irish cream ice cream with a Carmel macaroon. We both got some and enjoyed everything!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I really like Milk Bar. I visited the Vegas location for the first time recently (previously I had only been in New York), and it's a cute little counter spot located in The Cosmopolitan. For those that don't know, Milk was created by Christina Tosi, who founded the dessert programs at the Momofuku restaurants. This makes Milk a huge draw for a lot of people (including me), so don't be surprised if you visit and it's packed. We lucked out and it was completely empty when we stopped by early on a weekday, so we had no wait and we were able to order quickly. On this visit I opted for a Cereal Milk Latte, as I had just had breakfast and didn't have room for much more, but Milk offers so much more! They're slinging some standard desserts including truffles, pie, milkshakes, cake, and cookies; BUT, they offer them up in flavors you're not going to find anywhere else. First, their Birthday Cake flavor is unlike any other. Why? I don't know. It just is. And it's delicious! Try the Birthday Cake or the B'Day Truffles. They also have Cereal Milk (like my latte) and the Milk Bar Pie (a.k.a. Crack Pie) is bomb! If you're in the mood to opt for a cookie, try The Compost Cookie, it's got a hodgepodge of mix-ins, and it's delicious! And this Vegas location has tons of alcoholic drink options as well. Milk is a bit pricey, and depending on when you visit there may be a line, but I honestly think the desserts are worth it. It's not fancy, so please don't expect that, but if you're looking for a delicious cake, cookie, or pie, then Milk Bar is your spot.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Where has this ice cream been all my life?! Absolutely- delicious! The texture and flavor is unlike any other. I had a chocolate scoop paired up with a chocolate dipped waffle cone... because I obviously love chocolate, and it was chocolate heaven for my taste buds. Now let's talk about customer service. The BEST customer service received on my entire trip. We were greeted promptly at the door. We got free chocolate samples. Someone was ready at the register. I enjoyed the atmosphere so much, I decided to sit down and have my ice cream inside the establishment. Which was well kept and welcoming. #TeamGhirardelli",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"This might be my favorite Ice Cream shop in Arizona. And it get so much better as it's local! SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL COMPANIES! THIS IS MERICUH!! Actually to be honest I'll support any shop that has ice cream in it. Some information I guess since this is a review. -My favorite Ice Cream flavors by far are the Salted Butter Caramel and the Maple Pecan. But I've never had a bad flavor yet from them. And oh you better believe that I have tried them all. Possibly sampled every flavor every time I've went. -I love that it is open til 10pm. Seriously, who hasn't had the late night cravings for ice cream?? and Wow Thanks to Yelp I now know that it is open til 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays. This place gets better and better! If they would now only be open 24 hours then my dream of having premium ice cream at 3am can now be fulfilled. -They have Almond brittle -They have Bacon Brittle -Let me repeat that. They have BACON Brittle. This is by far the best bacon brittle that I've had. Makes me want to buy a package and sprinkle it all over everything. IF bacon makes everything taste better, how about bacon brittle?!? -Toffee Banofi. Just get it. I rate this place 5 stars. Woohoo! As good as it gets!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

"Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to stop by and get a slice of birthday cake. Usually love this place, but this time, I can't get over the thought that they changed the frosting recipe as it doesn't taste like cream cheese frosting but shortening frosting instead. Based on prior experience and the price I paid, had higher expectations.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3

As soon as we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the friendly workers who were more than willing to answer my never ending questions.

"Short Review: Donut Bar originated in San Diego and places an emphasis on fresh, tasty, picture worthy, and creative donuts. If a caked donut full of sugar is your thing, then give Donut Bar a try. Donut Bar is considered one the best and their customer service is excellent. Just be early because these donuts sell out fast. Longer Review: I remember the excitement when Donut Bar opened in Las Vegas. I'm not going to lie. I wasn't that excited when I heard the news. I didn't bookmark this place and had the opinion that Donut Bar was just hype. I'm originally from the 619 and remember when the first Donut Bar opened their doors in Daygo. I was one of those people that waited in line. The owner of that location was pretty cool and would walk by the line with full sized donut samples to patrons waiting to get in. Originally, I wasn't a fan. I had a few failed visits because their donuts were either out or I got something that was too sweet. I always picked a donut that just didn't ""wow"" me. I am also not into a cake donut with a bunch of sugar on it. I'm really boring when it comes to my donuts. I prefer a chocolate glazed raised donut, maple bar, cruller, or an apple fritter. That's all I really need or want when I'm in a donut shop. But when the girlfriend loves donuts, then you support her by eating donuts. I have been here a couple of times since grand opening week. I've tried the Samoa, The French Toast, Cake Batter, Caramel Latte, the Big Poppa Tart, CrÃ¨me Brulee, Matcha Cake, PB&J, and of course, the Homer. Their originality, freshness, and consistency stands out. I haven't had anything here that was too oily and greasy. Again, these donuts really do not appeal to me and in my opinion, just too sweet. But then I had their Caramel Latte. This donut is perfectly glazed with their latte flavor. Then a little whipped cream and caramel is added. Because this donut is large, the glaze and toppings do not give it that overly sweet taste. The texture is also perfect and not dry at all. This donut with a cup of their hot coffee equals perfection. I will cheat on my chocolate raised donut any day for their Caramel Latte. This donut alone made me a fan. 2017 Yelp Review #77",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4

It didn't disappoint-- tons of hot fudge, whipped cream, creamy soft serve and warm cookie pieces.

"The macarons were pretty standard, and on the pricey side unless you get a 5 pack. Would give them 4 stars, but the first time we tried to go there, it was an absolute nightmare. We asked two Venetian employees where it was; one gave directions to the ""closest one"" and said there were three locations, the other said there was only one location and directed us to the one under the escalators by the Grand Lux. We arrived at that location 7 minutes before 9 (closing time) and the place was abandoned. We made it to the one facing the Strip about 3 minutes later just by chance and it was also closed. That location also opened late the next morning when we went back and I would have foregone the entire thing had I not wanted macarons so badly before my flight home. On the plus side, there was no line at all and I really liked the packaging of the 5-pack for the airplane.",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,3
"Presti's is awesome! I live essentially right next door to the place and love to get cannolis and cafe au laits when I just want to relax and catch up with a friend. I don't get to see one of my friends much, but when I do, we ALWAYS go to Presti's. At times, we get overwhelmed with the crowd there, but we never fail to see cute babies and indulge in some fantastic desserts! The stromboli is amazing as well! The convenience is also incredibly appreciated, as there was once a wine filled evening when we all wanted some cookies. Luckily, they're not only convenient, but delicious too!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"Now as a vegan, I wanted to write a new review to reflect my thoughts on Novel Ice Cream. I visited with some friends on Friday night. The space is really small and there were two people behind the counter serving samples, scooping scoops, and checking us out. With about 6-7 people ahead of us, It took about 15 minutes before we got to the ordering counter. We taste tested the two vegan flavors that they offered in the current moment - lychee and some sort of berry sorbet. The berry sorbet was VERY sweet, but the lychee was perfect! I shared a double scoop with my partner and added a single vegan topping. While the berry was overly sweet, the lychee was able to tone it down a bit. I believe they also offer a vegan sprinkle cookie and certain cereals as toppings! Maybe they'll make vegan doughnuts or offer more vegan flavors one day?? Know that there was plenty of street parking when we arrived. There was a scatter of people before our arrival. When we got our ice cream, there was a long line of about 15 people down the ramp! Timing is everything I suppose. Love the vegan offerings and will be back/recommend because of this!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5

"I give the Confetti Cookie 4 stars - delicious! The Chocolate Chocolate cookie's flavor leaned a little too heavy on the dark chocolate side for my husband's liking (and for mine). I tried the Cereal Milk White Russian. I think it would be better without the cereal milk flavor. Husband had a chocolate cereal shake and found the cereal milk flavor to be too overpowering. I guess it's just not for us, but if you are someone who lurvvs cereal milk, then this place might be perfect for you!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3

"Donuts & coffee, the forever couple. This place gets it right in a cute downtown location. I went early afternoon on a weekday and there was still a good selection of a variety of flavors. These are really aesthetic ""crowd-pleasing"" donuts, I tried three. They're lighter (yeast-raised) than fancy donuts elsewhere, not so much the ""i had two and I don't need to eat again today"" I've run into elsewhere. The prices are also surprisingly competitive. Discounts for a dozen, and there were some basic bar-shaped donuts for just a dollar when I was there. This place won't break the bank. There's curbside parking (metered), and a shared shady courtyard out back. Check it out.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I have never had ice cream that was soo good... we ordered a cookies and cream scoop and then a churro sandwich with vanilla a ice cream with some caramel drizzle! Oooooo! If you are not dog friendly I suggest another ice cream shop, (maybe Mitchell's down the street ?) We came and didn't really know until we were here and wondering why there were so many dogs! This cute little shop can get VERY crowded. The staff here is VERY friendly and willing to help with whatever you need. I will be coming back for more of the churro! So savory and just enough sugar. Thank you so much for the lovely experience! Also, a small note!

It is full of rum, they even soaked the raisins in it, it is very flavorful - perfect for the holidays. I bought two half gallons. All of their flavors are made with premium ingredients by one of the best!

"The Crack Pie Ice cream is TO DIE FOR!!!! Crack pie is also very delicious as well. I've been a longtime IG follower and was pumped to hear that there was a MILK in Vegas back in April. Had a local take me to the money and spent a shit ton of $ on desserts for the 5 hours drive back to California. Best cookies to order in my opinion are the compost and cornflake-chocolate-chip-marshmallow cookie. I honest feel like the cornflake is the best. If you have a craving for corn, grab the cornbread cookie. First time I had it, it hit the spot... Second time around it kind of tasted different. Hoping that that was just the heat and alcohol causing the difference. When ordering the soft serve, do yourself a got damn favor and get the crack pie with cornflakes... That shit is FIRE! OVERALL - love this damn spot & they need to come to SoCal!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Very basic pastries. We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery but it was disappointing. As I wrote in the review about his restaurant, due to his popularity they very busy and cater to quantity rather than quality. I've been to better bakeries, don't waste your time in the long lines or your money. My SO tried a cupcake and had the cannoli cheesecake, they are gluten free so no crust, my favorite part. I will not return. Overrated:-(",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"I feel like Milk Bar is the backup plan for people unwilling to wait in line for an hour for eggslut. I'm so glad we are those people. Milk bar has these little bagel pops that is just a bunch of cream cheese stuffed into a bagel roll. They also have drunky milk shakes and coffee (hair of the dog) that are surprisingly strong and can get a good morning buzz going. Don't judge, it's Vegas! We went back twice because they get people through the line quickly, and their drinks and treats are tasty.

"Disappointed is my word for this location. I have visited the Fort Lauderdale location twice and have walked away raving about the food. When I saw that Las Vegas had a shop, I was giddy!! We took our, who was a first timer, into the shop as well and told her about all the yummy options!! I didn't want too much so I ordered 2 scoops of Cookie Monster with hot fudge. The server seemed to not understand my order but finally got it straight. It wasn't bad. For $8.99, it should be amazing, right? My friend ordered a chocolate milkshake. Again, a different server seemed to be lost on what to do. In the times of today where lots of places are short on help, I wasn't surprised. She also asked for whipped cream, which is an added charge. This shake took 5 minutes to make. Not sure why. And her whipped cream wasn't on it. She said something about it didn't taste right. We couldn't figure out what. My husband ordered the cookies with ice cream. It's our most favorite thing. He was extremely disappointed. The cookies were really hard and didn't taste fresh. The store was busy but the employees seemed off. There wasn't a lot of communication and the whole visit was just not what we had hoped. It felt messy in there. I would return to the FL location again but not this one.",Negative,Negative,Negative,unknown,2

A vanilla cupcake because I'm obsessed with plain ones. A cream puff filled with decadent custard! Macaroons, a Nutella cookie, black & white cookies & chocolate covered strawberries!

"As I walked up to the window, the concrete floors were swept, and the stainless-steel countertops were, pun intended, stainless. The red, white, and blue color scheme occupied my line of sight. The pictures posted of the ice cream dropped my jaw to the ground and led a river to flow out of my mouth. The gorgeous atmosphere and savoring pictures give a warm welcome to anyone who approaches. However, the long line of desert hungry people awaiting to have their orders taken haunted me. I stood distraught at the idea of this long line starting at the window and ending at the handicap parking space. The waiting time just get up to the window was around eight minutes; this was a minor inconvenience that can later be redeemed if the ice cream is delicious. On my first visit, I was overwhelmed by the dozens of flavors mounted on the sign. I was taunted by each flavor. It felt like each flavor of ice cream was calling out to me to get a scoop. The multiple freezers you can see inside the store only make you wonder what flavor is hidden inside. Any concoction you can make up, they will probably have it. They had a variety of ice cream flavors such as Chocolate Malt with Caramel, Banana Nut Cake, Coffee Chocolate Chip, and Pistachio. Not only does Handel's serve ice cream, they serve sherbets, ices, fat-free ice cream with no sugar added, and low-fat yogurt (if you want a somewhat healthier option). The manifold of desert options given at Handel's flood your head as soon as you come face to face with the menu. The various ways you can get the ice cream served is also endless. You can get your ice cream served in four different types of cones, in a normal bowl, or even in a quart and pint. Your ice cream can also be made into different variations; they can be served as a banana split, a sundae, a hurricane, and as a popsicle. This variety, for both flavors of ice cream and ways the ice cream is served, really impressed me. Some ice cream shops I have visited just have a couple of tubs of ice cream and they have the option of it being served in a bowl or cone. The fact that Handel's has been able to branch out of being a traditional ice cream shop made me set it apart from any other ice cream shops. Once I got up to the window to order, I found the service to be mediocre, well at least from the person serving me. He greeted me and took my order, but what became prominent is that he did not want to be there, which is understandable. He did not receive me with a smile on his face and he forgot one thing I ordered. The waiting time to get the ice cream in your hands can also take a while as they have to walk away and scoop into a tub of frozen cream and sugar. I then got the ice cream in my hands. I got a tower of the Chocoholic Chunk and I tried Banana's Foster, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, and Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie from those I went with. My ice cream of choice was a chocolate party because the ice cream was very rich in chocolate and had chunks of chocolate all throughout. You had a chunk in each bite, and the best part was that the chocolate was not hard and chalky like the M&M's get in a Mcflurry. As I just got a lick of the three other flavors I can only have a minimal opinion. The Banana's Foster was a blast of banana with a hit of sweet caramel. The Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough had the same big lumps of chocolate and smooth indulgent balls of cookie dough all mixed in a rich vanilla ice cream. The Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie had squares of chocolate rich brownies and scoops of actual peanut butter spread throughout the chocolate ice cream. The intensity of these flavors freezing our tongues made the wait worth it. If the ice cream is this indulging the prices must be outrageous as well. Each type of cone and bowl come with a price less than five dollars. Each of these cones come with a pile of three of more scoops making the price well worth it. The pints and a plate with four scoops of ice cream are also around five dollars. What I believe is a great deal at Handel's is the Two Buck Tuesday promotion they have every Tuesday. Any cone or bowl of ice cream will come down to two dollars each rather than four dollars. If you decide to go on a Tuesday, you better be ready for the long lines! The price point is perfect for a flavor packed scoop of ice cream.",Positive,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
"I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison. I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront, which to me meant that they'd likely have more goodies to offer. I was not disappointed. I've had numerous great items in the past from Batch, from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread. One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the ""morning bun."" I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop. As what Corey D woul say, ""son of a batch!"" This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eaten........believe me, I've eaten many. This one may actually rival Simma's in Milwaukee. This alone would warrant 10 stars, but damn Yelp only allows five! I need to try one of their savory offerings and a loaf of challah the next time I'm in town!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5

Yummy!!!! First time I have been to a Sprinkles that served ice cream. The kids had the ice cream sandwiches.... They were huge- too big we threw a bunch away! The cookies were good but I'd say stick to the cupcake ice cream sandwich. I had the chocolate cupcake with salted caramel ice cream. Yummy! It was the perfect size too...,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Full disclosure: I used to work at Honey Hut years ago. I love Honey Hut, the owners, the company atmosphere, everything. I could probably ramble on for days, but I'll cut it short. In summary: HONEY PECAN IS THE WAY, THE TRUTH, THE LIFE.",Positive,unknown,unknown,unknown,5
"Phenomenal!! If you had not stopped into this little 600sq ft. of a wonderland of dreaminess, creamiest, indulgence perfection.......STOP what your doing, put down whatever you're eating and head to Novel ASAP! Seriously, you're welcome for passing on the most positive ice cream experience ever! Here's the down-low it took this owner 2 years, to find the perfect ice cream maker, and a year to perfect his doughnuts! So bottom line; the PERFECT doughnut is stuffed with perfect ice cream! Here's the scoop, there's 12 flavors of ice cream, handfuls of toppings, and cereal, if you choose, to top off your ice cream. I tried all flavors before deciding on what I think is the best combination in the world! Strawberry balsamic and a scoop of honey lavender! I kid you not, it's the best! My son got Cookie Monster stuffed in a warm doughnut, hubby got bourbon toffee with cinnamon crunch cereal stuffed in a warm delicious doughnut! This may sound over sweet, and stomach churning with sugar overload, on the contrary....it's not too sweet! It's perfected to be balanced, leaving you wanting more! It's magic, I don't understand it? The owner and staff were outstanding providing exceptional service, and products!! I'm bowing down, as I finish this review! See you tomorrow!",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
I can't say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlo's Bakery!! I don't gamble and I'm not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub. I love lobster tails and I'm not talking the fishy kind I'm talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard.. unfortunately that's not what I got at Carlo's.!! I wished I'd have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends.. well I couldn't wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished I'd had a trash can to spit it back out.. it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite.. I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldn't take but one bite either.. the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones. Well I think we got the oldest ones they had.. not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop.. sorry Buddy this place was terrible!!,unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,1
"Maybe i am not fancy enough, but it just tasted like a cupcake. It was funny to order from an ATM. I rank it low because it was expensive (4.50 each) and not all that special. they are also not big at all. For the price, i expected it to be a larger cupcake.",unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,2
"The donuts here were tasty and very beautiful to look at; however, I think the price is not necessarily justified. It is a nice place to visit, but not for a return trip. As you can see the photos, the case is filled with some pretty cool donuts. The second photo is the Nutella donut, and while it was good it was not filled very full.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3
"I absolutely love this place! It is such a tastefully decorated and cute cafe tucked towards the back of the Arboretum Shopping Center. They were the first place in Charlotte that I knew of that served Black Sesame Ice Cream! I remember making it as a suggestion at local ice cream shops but no shop ever took the idea. I'm also a huge fan of Matcha and I absolutely love their Matcha ice cream since it's not overly sweet. My latest addiction is their Ube Latte with Oak Milk. They have since added some pastry items to their menu and my favorite is the Matcha Cream Puffs. The store is really bright and clean. The staff is always friendly and so patient since I have a hard time making a decision sometimes. I love how you can order online as well. I sometimes buy their pints of ice cream to keep a stash at home since the store is a bit of a drive for me. Overall, can't wait to try more of their items!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
First visit and we were definitely impressed. Excellent ice cream flavors and shakes! We will definitely be back soon.,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
Luis & Clarissa were super nice & helpful! Definitely the best experience I've had here yet!,unknown,unknown,Positive,unknown,5
"Second time visiting, had to get my Lobster Tail fix! Those suckers are addicting. The brownie was just okay and the regular cannoli was good, didn't care for the chocolate cannoli. It's best to go on Yelp to check out the pics, that way when it's your turn to order you pretty much know what you want. It's hard to see when you're in line because the people ahead of you are blocking the display case. It is pricey but hey it's the Cake Boss, lol.......and you are in Vegas. Enjoy!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Shaved ice, ice cream, boba, and Filipino desserts all under one roof? Don't mind if I do! Very clean and welcoming atmosphere, sweet and accommodating staff. Their calamansi boba is unbelievable. Please keep this on the menu forever and always! They've got another loyal customer in me!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"My kiddo and I love this place, so many flavors to choose from, many have one or two mix-ins! It's a walk-up place, so you order outside at the window and then get handed your ice cream through the same window.",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"Good crepes can be really hard to find, but these are amazing. Their savory options are some of the best I've had. You have to wait a bit sometimes, but that just shows how popular and fresh they are. There is one guy that works there (maybe owns it?) that is a little scary from unfriendliness, but it's a brief interaction that shouldn't stop anyone from eating here.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"So rude and was so unprofessional,my wife told him it was our first time can he suggest the most popular he was like no didn't give any samples so yeah, I understand the names being unique but no info on flavoring overall will not go back and was expensive",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,1
"The best tiramisu and gelato in town. Light dinners range from 7-10 dollars. The paninis are fabulous and so are the Cavetelli and meatball. You enter and take a ticket. (If there are people blocking the doorway with deer in the headlight expression yell "" excuse me"" and then push your way in.) Very clean and laid back atmosphere. Prestis is mostly known as a bakery. Its an after dinner treat in Little Italy. Great sidewalk cafe seating as well as seating indoors. Silverware and cold water are self serve as are the sodas and other beverages. Great place to take a date after dinner. I prefer the Stracciatella ice cream but the spumoni is good too. The lunch specials are hit or miss and I've had one served ice cold. No I'm not kidding. Stick to dessert anx you'll be fine.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"Line was about 25 people long. It went fast! They have a variety of pastries and desserts to choose from. We got a tiramisu where the mascarpone tasted great. Creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. Got another dessert with chocolate ball over a cookie - toddler approved. The coffee was good. They serve lavazza coffee, fyi for coffee connoisseurs.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"You know that random moment into an 8 hour round trip when it's 2 am and you need a bit of caffeine to wake you up but you refuse to drink McDonald's coffee? Typically you're bummed because no good coffee place is open. This isn't one of them. AmÃ©lie's is open 24/7, no matter what time they will always be a macaron (or some delicious pastry) and drink waiting for you there. The service is super fast as it is counter service with wonderful drinks like Rose tea or rose syrup in random drinks. They carry wonderful brands like Harney & Sons (which to me is great). They also have a mean chai and espresso. The service is super fast especially if you're like me and you're counting down the hours for when you'll come home. The art decor ;(sadly I have no pics), is very hobo chicish, old looking art such as Mona Lisa with hipster sunglasses, random shoes all over the place that remind me of the movie Marie Antoinette. The back has a tapestry or two and covered in art with tables and couches for you to study at 3 AM comfortably and quietly(they even have a quiet room)!!!! Leaving AmÃ©lie's was like leaving a new place you'd almost called home, but alas I had a real home to get to. If you're in the area check them out and try their macaroons, they're hugeeeeee and fresh!!!",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Pretty awesome. I've been going to this place since I was little, and it's been consistently good as far as I can remember. THE ONLY THING, is that I wish they had a cake batter flavor, it's my favorite and sometimes it's the only thing that brings me to Cold Stone. Other than that, I love Custard Cup. I usually get a cookie-dough snowstorm, cold-fudge sundae, butterscotch sundae, or strawberry custard, but you can never go wrong, seriously. I never feel like it's officially summer until this place is open!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
I get the pizza every time I visit. I love that there is always ample sauce so I can enjoy it room temperature rather than warmed up. It's so good I'll even grab a slice after eating at Mama Santa's.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Okay, so I may be reprimanded for this rating! I don't get how this is good 'custard'. If custard stands for froyo-ish ice cream then yes it's good. Good texture, stays cold, no overpowering flavour and just yhe right amounts of sugar. And the lemon one is the best flavour. But, IMHO, this is not custard.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
Really cool spot. I tried the Campfire S'mores flavor - it was incredible! It even had a touch of smokey campfire flavor. Nuts! The building itself is a work of art and it's cool that you can watch them actually make the ice cream right then and there. Was worth the stop. And the line.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Absolutely amazing. Flavor combos are unreal ... if you like classic cereals, you have to visit this place!!",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Walking up to Jeni's I felt a sense of southern hospitality and charm. In the heart of South End, the location and ambiance is top notch. I was practically knocked over by the amazing smell as I entered the shop. Their homemade waffle cones are to die for! Literally the best I've had (and I love some waffle cones). They offer so many ice cream flavors. Some on the traditional side and some creative and unique. I love the gooey butter cake and the salted peanut with chocolate flecks. Regardless of your taste, there is something for everyone!!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
Mitchell's is one of the best ice cream shops in the nation! Whenever I try new ice cream shops I am always craving Mitchell's. The variety is perfect and the specials are always great. Pistachio is a classic but honestly there are no bad flavors. Service is wonderful and although in the summer lines can be long it's worth the wait!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Jeni's denied my 6 year old ice cream. No cash excepted, nice to know once you wait in line for 30 min. Even offered to let them keep the change out of a $20. It's real nice that Jeni's can't take care of those that take care of them. We have supported them 2 times a week since they opened, never again!",unknown,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"I was very happy this famous dessert place in New York opened in Vegas. But after trying the ice cream, I think this place is bit overrated. The milk soft serve with crunchy cereal add-on ended up costing me $7 something. I was like ??? at the moment because I couldn't believe I paid that much just for ice cream. The price might work for NYC but definitely not sustainable here. There's no line when I visited. The soft serve was good but I think the cereal was a bit too salty. I'm not sure if I will come back.",unknown,unknown,unknown,unknown,3
"If you're looking for a spot to bring your kids for a quick treat or if you and your friends want to reminisce about your child hood days, come here and grab a cereal shake",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I tried to love it. I really did. So much so I tried it 4 times. Their cupcakes and cake slices are so dry. Each and every time. The frosting is so heavy! But this could be a personal preference. The frosting is very thick and taste like pure butter. Savory items are okay. Both items were bland and plain. Again, I tried to love it but I just can't. You can't go wrong with their croissants. Haven't tried their coffee. Three stars for friendly staff, great location, and super cute store. We need more of these please!",Positive,Negative,Positive,unknown,3
"My sister ordered a key lime cake for my birthday celebration. The person who helped us when we picked up the cake was so lovely and the location is a cute, kind of cottage core style place. The cake was denser tha I had anticipated and had a more shortbread or pound cake thickness. Lime curd was tasty. All around good cake but would prefer to try something else next time. Would give a 4.5 if I could.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,4
"I could not get enough of this place! I've been to the original Milk in NYC, so I was hoping for a similar experience. I was not disappointed, the Vegas location tastes just like real thing! All the ice cream is made from cereal milk and it tastes A-MAZE-BALLS. With or without the cereal crunch toppings, this place won't let you down! Located inside the Cosmo, just up the escalator, it's in a great location next to many other food options. My only gripe is that it's a bit pricey, but so was the NYC locale.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
Graham central station best flavor hands down! We come here every couple weeks! The staff is super friendly and nice and the ice cream is always amazing!,unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Great place for homemade ice cream. Location is on the Ohio city strip so if you don't want to eat your ice cream in store, there are places to walk to. The ice cream is tremendous, smooth in texture and tastes great. Being homemade ice cream, this location features the ""magic shop"" where all the ice cream is made while you wait!",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"The first time I came here years ago I absolutely loved this place, but my most recent visit was lacking. It's a fun spot with a really interesting atmosphere and a beautiful display case of pastries. We got a myriad of treats to try and my husband also got a latte. I really wanted to try one of their lattes but can't have caffeinated coffee, unfortunately for me they don't have decaf espresso so I didn't get to try one. My husband really enjoyed his though. I tried a bite of nearly everything and it was all so sweet. I eat baked goods a lot so I expect them to be sweet, but these were so sugary I just couldn't stomach much of it. They were all good but far from the best I've had. The tables were littered with crumbs and hadn't been cleaned, which is a little off putting. The service behind the counter was helpful and prompt. I would say it's worth checking out if you're visiting and wanting to do something unique.",Positive,Positive,Positive,unknown,3
Frankly I don't know what people like about it. To me this gelato just doesn't taste very good and I give it 3 stars because I am in a good mood. It's not terrible just not the place I would frequent (come again),unknown,Negative,unknown,unknown,3
"I mean it's hard to complain when it's ice cream.... Novel is a cute spot in a slightly hidden location. Although I do love the look and feel of the artsy/grungy sitting area -- very First Friday vibes. Novel is known for their ice cream between two warm donuts. I couldn't do something that sweet so I settled for a scoop of their lavender lemon. It was light and refreshing! I wish there were more flavors to choose from, I was slightly underwhelmed by their selection. But still a great late night spot in downtown.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,4
"The Crepe deserves 10 stars - it's as good as street crepes in Paris. It's the only one in North America which is. The service deserves minus 10. They're about as joyous as Thom Yorke Radiohead trapped in a Medieval Torture Device during a family bereavement. ""Crepes"" by Radiohead When you were here before The servers wouldn't look you in the eye They don't act like angels And they make you cry They ruffle your feathers They live in a gloomy world They think they're so special They're so f***ing special But they have crepes! And you're a weirdo! That's why you keep coming here! Even though they treat you wrong here I sang that out loud last time I was here. You should have seen the dirty Luxe I got. I'm giving them a 5 star rating despite them having the worst service - perhaps that I've ever experienced. And if you have a problem with that, I don't give a crepe. It's one of the worst customer service experiences of my life, but it's also the best crepe in North America, so I'm giving it a 5 when they deserve a huge 0 (a zero, not an O, no way) for the enormity of their attitude problems. What to get: Crepe with sugar and lemon. That's it. Nothing fancy. Trust me bae. What not to get: Angry when they treat you like a pile of horse sh**. These kind of Luxe might not be for Lorde, but they're absolutely for me. I'd say (and there is some decent competition in Philly and Indy among other places) that this is the best Crepe I've had in the USA. It's the most similar to France. Shame about the sh** service though. What a contradiction. We're talking about probably the best crepe and found in North America. I would know. I love this sh**. I go to France for this sh**. I know which alley in Paris the very best and most moist (moistmost) can be found in. I am the sh** when it comes to knowing sh** about which crepes are the sh**. Most Americans (I'm British, and we like talking sh**) grow up on sh** bland sh** crepes so they wouldn't know the sh**ting difference, would they? Like sh** they would. So these are the most authentic and traditional and true to the style of France. I think whoever started making these must have visited France a good number of times because this is almost the way they taste on the streets of Paris. Get it with nothing but sugar and lemon. That's the French way. In addition to being hairy and thin and making out a lot. With more than church tongue. On the other hand, we're talking about some of the worst service imaginable. I mean I've had so many bad service experiences here I don't even want to go into most of them. I can think of 5. I'll just tell you about one. Most recently I stood in line for about 10 minutes - about 5 minutes before closing - and they refused to give me a crepe. They weren't remotely nice or apologetic. I explained I was only in town from Buffalo once every 6 months, and that I'd just stood in line for 10 min, and there were still 5 mins to go. And they were passively aggressively complaining about people being in their line close to closing time and saying things like (loudly) such as ""I hope those people don't think they're actually going to get served"" and ""don't you just love when people feel entitled to get served after we're closed."" It wasn't just one or two comments. They were loudly giving sarcastic crap to their customers (particularly me) for a good few minutes, all the way not actually telling me directly, sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow. They waited until the clock had ticked to closing time for that. Hmm, how convenient. I've written what, 5,000 reviews? Near enough. I don't think I've ever been served by people quite this rude. And consistently so. It's definitely in my 5 most offensive and ugly customer service experiences. So They get -5 stars for massive customer service problems and horrendous attitudes and treating their customers like sh**. On the other hand I'm basing my actual rating only on the taste of the wonderful Crepes so it gets 5 Stars although I do so with a heavy heart because they are absolutely awful to their customers particularly me but it's happened so often that it probably happens to others too and I bet they'd have way better ratings if they were even remotely nice or fair to the people paying for their products run on sentences ftw amirite. Anyway if you read this far, thanks for giving a crepe.",unknown,Positive,Negative,unknown,5
"I thought i was going to love this but didnt. the ice cream was just ok and the guy behind the counter called it gelato, this isnt gelato. i also got the marshmellow and macron cookie on top.

My partner and I were interested in the non-dairy options they provided. I had the dark chocolate truffle & he had the caramel pecan sticky buns. Both extremely delicious I was super surprised. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
OMG! I Love this ice cream but after going there this evening and noticed that none of the employees were wearing masks or using gloves I will not be subject to irresponsible practices. We all need to be safe and courtesy of each other's health. You should also know that it is mandated by the Governor that masks are also required of your customers or they don't get served. Whether you believe or not in this virus you do not have any right to disregard health directives. So disappointed.,Negative,unknown,Negative,unknown,1
"One of my favorite bakeries in Charlotte, the NoDa one is my favorite location because it has such character and charm. They're not famously known for their Salted Caramel Brownie for no reason--this is a must-order! They also have a great selection of interesting macaron flavors.",Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"I was very excited to try this place but it was not like I expected it to be. Seeing the long line I thought it would taste great, but once I entered the location, the bakery items looked very average. I knew by its appearance that desserts would not be what the hype was about but I really wanted to give it a try telling myself that something has to be great with everyone sanding in line for a treat. I ordered the most popular thing on their shelf and let me tell you, it was most definitely not good at all. I ordered 2 lobster tails, 1 strawberry shortcake and 1 chocolate hazelnut cupcake - $27 later I am left unpleasantly dissatisfied. One plus was the very helpful clerk behind the counter.",unknown,Negative,Positive,unknown,2
"A must-visit in Madison. It's a large storefront with few seats and many savory and sweet pastries. Their croissants filled with gruyere are literally the best croissants in Wisconsin. Their cheese crusted garlic bread sticks are large, greasy, and I have dreams about them. My favorite thing to do on the run is to buy one of their large bread balls with meat or bean filling. It changes daily - sausage, mushroom, and cheese; chick peas, pesto, and cheese; bacon, white bean, and parmesan. All amazing, though you'll need two to be full. I haven't even gotten to the sweets yet but rest assured that they're also all fantastic.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
What a cute little cafe. Got the parfait with a Matcha swirl and it was delicious!! I wish I had more appetite to get drinks. Everything we got was perfect and so unique. This is exactly the type of place Charlotte needs.,Positive,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"1 star off: I stopped by this bakery around noon on a Thursday and there were no croissants left. Aren't croissants a staple of French bakeries? 1 star off: No apology... 1 star off: No indication of when they will have a new batch... Just that there were no more croissants. I looked at the display case and there were only a few macaron flavors left as well. I like the Bouchon Bakery in Napa a lot, so I wanted to try this location. I just wish this location is better stocked, especially with the items that make it unique. Otherwise, it is just like a Starbucks...",unknown,Negative,Negative,unknown,2
"I'm visiting from California and needed something to help cool me off because it's so damn HOT out here! I decided to try out Novel Ice Cream because of the great reviews and I'm happy I tried it out! I had the mimosa sorbet and it was very refreshing on a very hot day. However, my favorite part was the customer service! Jalen was extremely nice, funny, and helpful. If I ever come back to the this hot ass desert again, I will Forsure come back to Novel Ice cream",unknown,Positive,Positive,unknown,5
"Shame on me for not reviewing this place sooner! The Macarons are amazing here, they're so good that they're indescribable. I can't do them justice but I'll try. First of all, they're big and in this case bigger IS better, they're light, perfectly chewy and deliciously creamy in the middle. No other Macaron can compare, I continue to try others in hopes that they might be as good but I'm always disappointed. My absolute favourite is Raspberry, I've tried Chocolate, Vanilla, Coffee, Caramel and I think at one point they had Lemon also. The Caramel straight up had real caramel in the middle, making it extra decadent. They are just the most wonderful treat possibly ever.",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
"Girlfriends would boast about Bouchon so this was my first shot of trying one out. Well, at least the bakery part. There's apparently 3 locations within the Venetian Casino, I managed to find two out of three. This one I found was near one of the hotel entrances. The line builds up quickly, so if you've heard of Bouchon or can smell the pastry, get in line! And no cutting!!!! Tried their regular and chcolat croissant---they nailed it perfectly just like the ones in Paris. Vanilla and chocolate eclair: so damn yummy. Each bite explodes of flavor, I'll leave that to you to think about. What they dropped the ball on the bread pudding. Way too much raisins jammed into the overly dry pastry that you end up building a pile of raisins as you rip through pieces of the bread pudding. Mind you, we got out pastries at 9am. Another note that if you order any type of drinks here on top of the pastry, you pay for everything, get the pastries up front...but the procedure on how you get your drink is idiotic. That definitely needs to be improved because not noting what they just made or even a name to a particular drinks= many pissed off faces standing by a counter that only lets one person get to it to get a drink. One. at. a. time. Oh dear...",unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,3

On my very first visit to this Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas inside The Grand Canal Shopes at The Palazzo/The Venetian. The wait to get in was really no wait at all because I came around the slow part of the day. I got a cannoli which I had always wanted to try. It was extremely delicious and fairly priced too. I also purchased A souvenir metal coffee mug. I love the food their and next time im in the area im going to come back for more for sure. If you want awesome desserts that's delicious in your stomach and good on the wallet come to Carlos Bakery the worlds greatest bakery.,unknown,Positive,unknown,unknown,5
