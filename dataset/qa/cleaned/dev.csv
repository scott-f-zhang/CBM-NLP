"Q: What are the similarities between iteration and recursion?
A: Iteration and recursion both use repetition and perform several simple operations and algorithms successively until they reach a certain limit.  So both involve a termination test to find that limit and both slowly approach that termination limit.  Both are based on a control statement as well.    If coded poorly, both can continue on for forever until the compiler or the computer either locks up, shuts down or halts the operation.",5,1,1,1,2,1,1,2,2
