"Q: How are infix expressions evaluated by computers?
A: Writing arithmetic expressions is called infix notation.  This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in ""a + b"").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written ""+ a b"".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written ""a b +"".  (You may have seen this as ""reverse Polish notation"".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.  One important characteristic of both postfix and prefix notations is that they are unambiguous; no parentheses are needed to indicate the order of operations.",5,2,0,1,2,0,0,2,0

"Q: What is the difference between a function prototype and a function definition?
A: The FUNCTION PROTOTYPE is where the programmer declares that he/she is using a function other than main( ). This is like declaring a variable, the programmer knows that he/she will be using in the future, but has yet to say where they are going to use it, or how. This is answers the question who, it gives the function a name and character. The function prototype, by common practice is placed at the beginning of the program after the #includes and before main( ). The FUNCTION DEFINITION is the guts of the function. This is where the programmer decides what the function is going to do and tells it how to do it. It takes whatever information it is given and performs the operations. It works sort of like the brain, the brain takes in input and based upon that input performs in some way producing an output. The function defintion is placed outside of main( ) and any other functions. A function is its own entity and should be thought of as such.",2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,0
