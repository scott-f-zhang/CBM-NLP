"Dear State Senator,

How do you feel about the Electoral College? Do you think that we should still keep the Electoral College or should it be changed by election of popular vote for the president of the United States? From my side I think that we should keep the Electoral College. There are my reasons that conviced me to say this because we have use it for many years now. How is it that you can vote without the Electoral College?

The first reason why I think we should keep the Electoral College is be cause it is not a place, it is a process. So how can this hurt other people to not want this if you can't find it? This process is a very smart thing that the founding fathers established because it is fare to everyone. It is fare because it is a voting decision that the electors elected as President and Vice President. To me making an election is the best way to make a decision so that everyone wont be angry at each other.

The Electoral College is a voting system. Voting is the one of the best ways to pick out things that everyone has a different opinion. For example, evey four years there is an elective going on for who can become president of The United States Of America. This system will allow everyone in the United States to vote who should be the next president. The same thing goes for the governments of each state and county.

When we use the Electoral College it helps us figure out the differents of each election. For example, when a president or government is being elected we can figure out who is grtting more electives. We can see how many people are voting and how many electives did each person received. With that being said we can easily tell which person won the elective and who didn't. We can also see the percentage of votes and how many states voted for each person.

These are my reasons why I said that the Electoral College should stay with us. It is a good way to vote, it helps us see how many people voted, and it is vary fare with everyone in The United States. Its has helped us vote for governments and presidents for many years and hopfuly it will still keep on running. This is why voting is the best way to make things equal with everyone because it is done by electing. Why would we want to take something away like the Electoral College when it was established by our own Founding Fathers?",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you really want a machine that tells you how you feel? If so why would you want a machine telling if you know how you feel like. These type of technology is not good and theres no need in having it mostly not in a classroom or school where anything could happen to it if you not carefull.

I dont think this technology should be used in school or in a classroom. Those machies and technology will coast alot and theres no need in having one in the classroom. No one would really use is and who willl really pay for one. If a kid plays around with it who will pay for it and theres no class that needs it. If you want one in your home you cant becuase your PC cant haddle it. in the text it states ""Your home PC cant handle the complex alogorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" meaning you will have to buy a better PC just to used the technology. The only thing it does is seeing how you feel. Its not gonna solve nothing or help its just gonna tell you how your feeling and no one know 100% if its always right. They tested on a painting and the person for the painting Mona Lisa is not live to say oh thats correct. Also it tells you how to look in the mirror so it can see how your feeling meaning you cant have or make your normal face becuase it wont work.

Its not god becuase how can it split all the feelings like that so this type of technology should not be in schools or homes. No need in wasting your money on the technology when you could get something better and maybe not as high in price becuase it didnt say how much it is and what type of computer you need so it could work.",2,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classrooom is valuable because everyday you can tell how the person in a class is feeling. In the article it says,"" In fact, we human perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday . For instance you can probaly tell ow a friend is feeling simply by look on her face."" Dr. Paul Eckman is a pyschologist who created FAACS (Facial Action Coding System.)

A quote in the article is ,""Eckman ha classified six basic emotion-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each with characteric movements of the fasical muscles.""

In the class would see if a student is shocked when a teacher says something shock thier eyebrowns will raise up. In article it's says,''For example your frontails muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised.""

Another reason the use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classrooom is valuable because the computer knows when human are confused. In the article it says,""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored or,""Dr. Huang predicts, Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor.""The same technology can make computer-animated face more expessive- for video games or video surgery.""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication,"""" notes Dr. Huang.""So computers need to understand that, too.""

The Last Reason The use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classrooom is valuable because compuers know your expression of your emotion. In the article it says,""The facial expression for each emotions for each motion observes Dr. Huang,""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

Also It says your lab partners may know how you feeling. In the article it says,"" that there is a differnce between a genuine smile and a force smile."" It also says in the article that in the real smiole,the zygomatic major(muscles that begin at your cheek boones) lift the cornes of your moth.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Author supposrts the idea of Venus being worthy of exploring dispite the challanges by stating in Paragraph 8 ""Striving to meet the challanges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likey lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This leads me to belive that if us as humans dont proceed to learn more about this planet we are not going to gain any knowladge and we will never know about the new dicovories we could have made. The Author also continues on about how Venus was belived to be filled with oceans and supported various forms of life and is reffered to as the Earths ""twin"". So this leads me to think that there is more out there than dangerous carbon dioxide blankets, clouds of corrosive acid and above boiling point tempatures. There possibley couldve been life.

This makes me agree with the Author's statemet even dispite the dangers Venus has. With it being so close to Earth and once possibly having living life forms on it. It makes me belive that we should be leanring more about it and building machines to study the materials of this planet. Us Humans make discoveries everyday and we build extrordinary things that you would only see in movies. I definitly think that one day we could build a machine to substand the harsh tempatures and dangerous chemicals Venus has. WIth listening to the Author points i belive that this could open new doors for us and maybe even one day visit the planet. In Paragraph 6 the author states that "" Many reaserchers are working on innovations that woud allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaninfuly to our knowladge of Venus""

This shows me that NASA and other astrologers have already began to try making machines to one day travel to Venus.

Soon one day we will have discoverd the planet of Venus and have learned many new things. This could possibly lead to new discoveries about tecnology and maybe even one day about human life. But we have to use our natural human instict of wanting to know more to find these amazing things. Thats why I agree with the authors statment that we should continue studying Venus despite the dangers it presents.",3,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Driverless cars should not be coming.

Some people may think that this is a cool and fun idea, but it is not safe for the driver or pedestrians.

There are many flaws to driverless cars that should be addressed and taken seriously.

This situation could be very dangerous.

The driverless cars cannot even fully function by itself.

Having the car be driverless someone could fall asleep from being bored or they are expecting the car to do all the work and not need their help.

If the car ended up needing human assistance, because they are not totally driverless, the person would be asleep and not take over, which could cause a wreck.

They could hit a pedestrian and get arrested or get charges pressed against them.

Even worse the person wouldn't have even been aware of what was happening beacuse they were asleep and that could have gotten them injured as well.

Another flaw to these cars is that it can cause people to become very lazy.

Everyone would get used to not having to drive themselves around so they would start expecting to not have to do even more things.

They would become very dependent of other people and things around them.

It would teach children to not learn to do things for themselves and become independent.

They would expect everything to be done for them by their parents, siblings, teachers etc.

In the passage it said they would have taxis as the driverless cars and then no one would have to have cars anymore.

If they make taxis the driverless cars and they do not need any drivers that would result in job loss for all of the taxi drivers.

Not everyone has a college degree and can get a big job so being a taxi driver is all they can do.

If that is taken away from them they are left with no job and no way to pay bills or provide for their families.

This would cause their families to go into debt and suffer just because there was now driverless cars.

Driverless cars are not something that the world should have.

They can make people lazy, are dangerous, and could cause job loss.

Just because it seems like a cool idea, does not mean it is a good idea.

Other people around the world have to be taken into consideration and all of the consequences of the cars have to be looked at and taken very seriously.",2,4,0,3,1,1,1,1,2
"In the story A Cowboy Who Rodethe Waves was a seagoing cowboy and he had helped people form world war 2 and that would of been the reason why I would join there program becuse they had helped people and he had also went across the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice.

The details from the article to support Luke's claims is in paragraph 4 Luke turned 18 before arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips- the most of any seagoing cowboy.

It took about two weeks for Luke to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. They had helped the people by helping time feed there animals.

Then something bad happened Luke was talking about his report on a rainy night and then fell off a ladder and he couldn't work for a couple days becuse he had cracked his ribs.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First,The face NASA found in Mars is just a landform and I can prove it. On the picture on 1976 it actaully looked like a human face, but a human face cant be that big. On 1998 the eyes and mouth started fading away like it was disapearing. On 2001, you can't even see the face anymore.

Next, It looked like it cracked, also scientists 'figured it was just another Martian Mesa, comman enough around Cydonia.' But, also scientists believed the face was an alien artifact but, they can't prove that it is just what they believe.

Then,On April 5, 1998 it said that Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia to see if it was real. When they got there they took some pictures of it for JPL web site, but it revealed that it was just a natural landform and it wasn't a alien monument.

Finally , just to make sure on April 8, 2001 it said in the article that ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""""They rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. What the picture actaully shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landform common around the American West.

In conclusion, there was no alien or face in Mars. It was just a landform making it look like there was a human face. This is my essay telling it was just a landform.",1,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"In my paragraphs I'm going to be talking about how Luke convinced other people to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it's an opportunity of a lifetime. Also you can see wonderful things and also tour wonderful places, like Europe and China just like I did. When I joined the program in 1945 World War ll was over and the whole place was ruined (which wasn't very beautiful in my opinion). That is my introduction.

Luke said, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" You can join this program, because it is just full of interesting sites, and places that you could go see and tour just like I did. ""The places that I toured was Europe and China"" ,says Luke. When Luke went to Europe which was 1945 World War ll was over and the place was left in ruins. You can also find super interesting and people that have fulfilling minds about all the places in Europe.

To support my claim Luke an some other cowboys had an amazing time on board (The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed) says Luke. He had more fun playing games then he did helping the animals. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United Statesand a month to get to China. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Those are my sentences to support Luke's claim.

In conclusion after reading these paragraphs you think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you can see all the things that maybe you have never saw before. You might have a blast just like Luke did. Luke also played baseball and volleyball with a few cowboys that he hadn't met before you can meet alot of people onboard.(Europe and China was the best tour ever).

Thank you for reading my essay about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, and I hope you join.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that the idea of driverless cars are a good idea, but I don't think they are necessary at all. They are pointless and cars should be driven manually. The idea of a safer car is too ensure the safety of passengers, drivers , and even pedestrians. Accidents are always going to happen, but it is up to drivers themselves to make this happen.

A good opposition to the idea of driverless cars is the psychological aspect. In the passage, it says, ""psychological aspects are really a challenge,"" and they should be. There is no point in having a driverless car that still needs the assistance of a human driver. Also, we aren't really saving gas amounts. The driverless cars are still going to require gasoline as fuel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not worth the investment. They will still need human assistance and drivers will be bored waiting for their turn to drive. The amount of gas needed will still be the same to power all the cars. This is why driverless cars are pointless.",1,3,1,2,1,1,1,0,1
"Driverless cars seem to be a great adance in todays technological society. However in my opinion I feel as though I personally would not use driverless cars while going to work or dropping my kids off at school. I would find it almost pointless to create let alone own a driverless car.

I personally would only use driverless cars on road trips when your tired of having to consintrate on the road you could just lay back relax and enjoy the scenery. I suppose the existence of driverless cars on a highway would be helpful in the sense of having less traffic jams or collisions. However, I feel that the car should have an on and off switch, in the sense of the driverless feature not the turning the car on and off we already have that.

Safety is one of my top concerns when I think about a driverless car. How will it detect the police when they need to get pass to an emergency? How will it pull into a gas station so it can be refilled for gas? A few new cars today have alot of new cool safety features such as stopping when sensing an obsticale ahead or cameras on side view mirriors and even a camera to assist in reverse driving.

Another thing abput driverless cars is what they mentioned in paragraph nine. Who would be responsible if the car crashes and someone is injured? The driver or the manufacturer? Also some states believe that the cars are not yet safe enought to be driven so they ban testing the driverless car in their state. Does this mean that we wont have safe driverless cars until the next few generations?

In conclusion I believe that driverless cars are useful but need alot more improvement before being sold to the public. If the improvement in technology makes streets safer to drive on then great.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Everday, wether we are in a classroom, at our house, or out in public, we are constantly decoding the emotions around us. For example, when your friend walks up to you with a stern face and squinted eyes, you will most likley assume that he or she is angry with you. Recognizing facial expressions is something we as human beings have done for the past thousands of years, sometimes involuntary. With that being said, we do not need a computer software to tell us everything we already know, a frown means you are upset, a stern face means you are mad, a lopsided eyebrow means you are confused, and a smile means you are happy. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.

Being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions, may sound like an awesome idea. However, this program is 100% useless. A system that can decode a humans emotion is udderly pointless, for no one needs to know the exact compostion of a human face and their emotions. As stated in the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation""every day."" I mean just think about it, what would you do if you knew the exact percent of happiness in someone, or maybe the percent of saddness? Exaclty, you would do nothing. That information is useless and a waste of time and money. We don't need a machine to exemplify the percise decimal of happiness, sadness, or confusin in any one person.

Whenever you buy a new computer, a new software, or even basic technolgy needs, the prices are always far above then what you predicted. That same concept includes this new software called FACS (Facial Action Coding System). This devloped and intelligent program will cost a pretty penny, without a doubt, for both the producer and the consumer. Not only will you need to forfit you money for this program, but most at home computers are uncapable to withold the magnitude of this program. The article states, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" Spending money, time, and effort on a skill humans have already learned is pointless and fruitless. The development of the technolgy industry has allowed for billions of dollars to be consempated, allowing for the goverment to go in debt, among other things as well. Introducing this program to the population will allow for money that has been worked hard for, be thrown down the drain.

Incorporating this new software program into classrooms around the globe is unessary for the development of students minds. Being able to detect specific emotions in a school setting is useless and a waste of time and money. Teachers are going to college, getting a degree, and expandign their teaching limits in order to be able to correctly investigate and discover the emotions of their students. As a teacher, that is their job. Introducing this technolgy into classrooms will not be beneficial, for knowing exaclty the percent compostion of one persons emotion is pointless, useless, and a frutile attempt to expanding the technology industry.

FACS is a new, intelligent, developed software system that allows for the emotions of any one person be decomposed into specific percent numerals. This evolving program incorporates new and imporoved technolgy functions into a redily avalible software. However, introducing this program to the world with cause nothing but useless and pointless results. Creating a new computer software system capable of recognizing different compoenets to a persons emotion is useless, a waste of money, and completey unessary for students and teachers in a classroom.",4,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform and not something that was created by aliens. The Face is a natural landform because the sharper pictures that were taken after the Viking photos revealed that it was a natural landform. Secondly, the scientists had taken another photograph which helped confirm what exactly the Face was. Also, the text states that the Face is ""equivalent of a butte or mesa."" Although some people think that the Face was created by aliens, there isn't enough information to support that claim.

First of all, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia in 1998. According to the passage, they ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" This means that this camera probably caught eye of more objects and got a more detailed idea of what this formation looks like. The Viking photos weren't as detailed, so the people who saw those photos originally got the idea that aliens had created it. The picture that was captured had revealed that this was, in fact, a natural landform.

Secondly, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia on a cloudless day, since some people were second-guessing if the picture was accurate or not. According to the text, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.

Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.

The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens.",3,4,4,4,3,3,2,3,4
"Venus is the second planet in our solar system, and despite how close it is to Earth, is largely unexplored. The reason why its been untouched for around 30 years is that Venus is too hot and has too much atmospheric pressure, which would crush and melt any spacecraft on its surface. Another reason is that there are clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid. However, NASA is working on ways to study Venus more safely.

In the passage, the author talks about why astronomers are facinated with Venus. They talk about how how the astronomers think that Venus used to be more Earth-like than it is today, with its valleys, mountains, and craters, in paragraph 4. Though in pragraph 3, the challenges presented by trying to study Venus more closley have more negatives than positives. One of the biggest problems in that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of the planets in the solar system, despite that Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus. Another problem being faced is the immense atmospheric pressure, which is around 90 times greater than Earth's.

The author also talks about how NASA is trying to find ways to counteract these problems. One example that they give, in paragraph 7, is that simple electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber that closley emulates the surface conditions of Venus. NASA has found that the technology lasted three weeks under those conditions. Another way that NASA is trying to solve the problems of Venu's surface is by using old, mechanical computers, which don't use the same kind of technology as regular, modern computers, but gears and levers instead.

In conclusion, putting a spacecraft on the surface of Venus may be a possibility in the future, or we may never find a way to keep a spacecraft on the surface for more than a few weeks at a time, which is cost ineffective. But as the author says in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",2,1,2,3,1,2,2,0,2
"The author of ""The Challenege of Exploring Venus,"" reasons for exploring venus are the planet could be the one that most resembles earth and to further scientific research.

The author wants us to be aware if Venus is the closest planet we have to Earth, and I dont mean proximity, im talking about most alike. They believe that It once had green life on it, oceans, and a livable atmosphere. The text states,""Long ago,Venus was probably covered largely with ocens and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The text also says,""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but surviable."" With those things in mind scientist feel it is a need to go see if it is like or if it was once like Earth.

Venus could also be used to just to further scientific studies. The text states"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a dstance."" The rock and gas samples and all the other things can be used to compare to rocks and gases here on Earth, see what is the same and what is different about them to get a better understanding of how alike or diiferent the two planets are.

To conclude, what the author wanted us to get from that article was that, the planet Venus could be very similar to Earth and that they could use it to futher scientific studies by studying the nature on the panet.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"I believe that the use of the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System would not be valuable towards students in a classroom. One example is that not all humans could possibly express emotions the same way therefore the student may not express an emotion completely. Someone could keep a straight face and feel many emotions. A direct quote from the passage is ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry,"" which I disagree with because it is unrealistic to know all the emotions a person is possibly feeling and especially how much percent of each emotion. I think it's absurd to trust this technology. The computer may be great and have all this amazing technology but there is no way that it could calculate emotions correctly. Another reason I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System to be valuable in classrooms is because not all classrooms need computers to work the way the class does and is supposed to. A direct quote from the article I disagree with is ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I believe that is where the instructing should be, within the instructor. I however agree that the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to video games. A direct quote to support that detail is ""the same techonlogy can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or videosurgery."" My final reason i disagree with the Facial Action Coding System to be valuable in classrooms is because the example the article uses does not really support their claim in the strongest ways possible. The direct quote that leads me to believe this is ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" The author should have used more persuading evidence to allow others to think this techonlogy would actually be important or valuable in any situation. These are reasons I do not think that having Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable.",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Driving while having not to drive seems like the way to drive, or does it? Being in front of the wheel but not taking any part of action that's going on seems like a brilliant future ability, but is it safe? In order to be safe at all times, the bottom line is driverless cars are dangerous because eventually techonolgy will go wrong, which goes along with risking your life, and not all people will take precautions in this situation.

People have been creating a variety of useful idea's thoughout the generation but overall this is one of the most dangerous. This car will have to always be checked because if something ever goes wrong with it, it will most likley crash. For example, if the car is driving on its own and somethings wrong with it, it could go ballistic because the car is controlled by itself and by the time you will take control of it you would be in an accident.

Dealing with the techonolgy of the car, your life is in great danger. Not only are you dealing with your own life, but maybe also the people in your car and drivers all around you. The driverless car does have ""special touch sensors,"" that ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" It doesn't mean they are paying attention to what is going around them. ""If the techonlogy fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" That is the real question about this whole argument.

This whole essay is ties up with the precaution of ""risking your life,"" driving on the road is already a dangerous thing to do but to allow cars that drive themselves adds up. As in the text says, ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object,"" there will always be people in this world who will be ignorant to these messages that the car implies. Sometimes the car will exaggerate the precautions you have to take making the driver think less of them.

There are endless of possiblities of things that can go wrong with driverless cars but also brilliant outcomes that can change the future. If people are willing to buy driverless cars, they must be alert at all times because there is a chance something might go wrong. So if you buy a driverless car, are you willing to take more chances of driving on the road than you already have?",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is probably the best story ever! The facial Action Coding System is a really great thing to do when you're at school or work. I think that it's cool that just scanning someones face can help you know what their real emotions are.

The thing I like most about the article is that it says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" I love how Dr. Huang could tell what Mona Lisa's emotions were by looking through a screen called Facial Action Coding System.

In paragraph three, it tells you that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. It scans the 44 major muscles in the model like human muscles.

He founded out that there are 6 facial expressions a person can have like, happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. I love how it can tell if your are making a fake smile or real smile by looking at your mouth. Usually if you're actually happy, your cheeks and eyebrows raise up and if you weren't smiling real then your lips wouldn't go up they would just move sideways and it wouldn't go up.",0,2,2,1,1,0,1,0,1

"Cars have dramatically changed the way human kind lives and they have not been ran by computers, only us. Humans have always been the one in control of cars. People can operate a car perfectly fine without assistance, so why are there people trying to make cars that drive themselves? A number of things could go wrong with a computer car. Technology always tends to crash or shut down unexpectedley, so what happens if our computer car does that in the middle of traffic?

To start off, the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" seems biased. There are many paragraphs backing up the new Google Cars, and only a couple backing up how dangerous they can be. What is hard for me to understand is the whole point of the self driving cars. Why do we need them? Do certain people have better things to do in a vehicle than drive it themselves? If someone were to buy one of these cars, i would assume that they would be in a constant fear that maybe the car would take a wrong turn and run into a tree.

Cars that we drive today can already malfunction in many ways. The breaks could go out, the tranmission could go out, the headlights could go out, the tires could fall off, etc. We can fix the tires falling off, we can fix our headlights, but does everybody know how to fix a computer when it crashes? We could be on the road eating food while our car drives itself and the car just completely stop because the computer in the car crahsed. Instead of paying 60 dollars for a tire repair, getting the Google car repaired would probably cost a few hundred that nobody would want to pay.

Google cars could cause a stir between the manufacturers and the drivers as well. If a driver was positive that the crash they had was the computer cars fault, that would cause problems. The car manufacturers would definately not want to admit they are at fault. The car would of course be very expensive, too. Many people will not even be able to afford a car that drives itself, but why would they want to? A self driven car can take away the fun in operating something big.

Why do we want to take the fun out of driving and feeling in control, or pay a big price for our computer car malfunctioning? Why do we want to put ourselves in even more danger by making an untrustworthy computer in charge of our lives? A computer car puts our lives at stake, and if a computer car proved to be at fault of a murder, that would also put the car creators in a bad situation.",2,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I thinkl that you should keep electoral college because qualified citizens chose it obvisliy. But besides that reason you should have it's a easy compromise to vote. It helps you choose your state's electors when you vote for president because you are actullay voting for your candidates electors. Under the system of electoral college voters vote not for presdint ,but for a slate of electors instead. It could help us undersatnd voting for our electors if you keep electoral voting. Even though some say that this was the 2000 fisaco was the biggest election crisis in a century. The system could of had worse. I think it helps with voting more than anything else instead of the online voting for the slate electors.

Some also so it should be abloished and that it's unfair and very irrantional, it has helped more than do any damage to any other type of voting like that tabs we once used to vote for everything. We should keep it because of its certanity of outcome because it helps when there is a tie on voting. ""Swing States"" are anthor reason because of the winner takes all method we sawin 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the  toss up states ,it help us out because at the end of paragraph 20 it says the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election with electoral college.  It does also big states electoral college restores some of the weigth in the political balance that large states lose by virtue.

It does also help with run-off elections it helps avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. It says that it may turn off voters for a candidate who has no hopes of carrrying their state. Those are my reasons why you shouldn't  get rid of electoral voting hopfully you will condsier it.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The Electoral College is not a very sufficient way of electing a president in democracy. The way it is run is faulty. If someone gets one more vote than there apponet they get all of the votes from that state? now what kind of sense does that make? doesnt make very much sense to me Mr. Senator.

In a democracy the people should get to elecct their leader. I know that the Electoral College is usually gives the same results as the popular vote but its not always 100% accurate. There is honestly no reason to have the Electoral College. The founding fathers put it in place but that was 200 years ago and I have no idea what they were thinking.

In my state, Florida in 2012 there was a very close election but Obama won by a very small margin and recieved all 29 votes from our state. That is some major bologna Mr. Senator. This is the United States of America and the canidate should recieve every vote he gets. The same thing happened in the 2000 election as well. it's not a reasonable sytem Mr. Senator.

The Electoral College has got to go. It is a faulty and injust way of electing a president here in the U.S.A. I love this country more than your average guy, it's the greatest place on Earth and i truly believe that. I also believe that we need to get rid of the Electoral College because it is absolute trash.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"Did you know that Venus was maybe once like earth? And also maybe know that ""Mechanical Computers"" were used back in World War II that NASA may get ther idea for a invention to study Venus ? Sounds shocking right, well let me tell how and why these two questions may sound odd, but intresting.

NASA has been working on finding ways to study Venus. They have simplified electronicsthat are made of ""silicon carbide"" that have been tested in a chamber that is like Venus's surface, and has lasted for about 3 weeks in the comditons as Venus's surface. They still are working on other inventions that will allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully knowledge of Venus. NASA has also wanted a ship to orbit and hover safely far above the planet so that it can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of photography and videography of Venus. Astronomers have wanted to return to Venus but they wasnt a mission safe and scientifically productive. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believe in the solar sytem long ago Venus was like was just like Earth at one point. They also believe that Venus once had the features like eath like an ocean, mountains, valleys, and craters. In Venusian geology and weather present erupting volcanoes and frquent lighting , and maybe even strikes on the land surfaces. Venus atomosphere is about 97 percent of carbon dioxide and has a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Its temaptures are an average over 800 degrees , its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather that we experience on our own planet. Each pervious mission was unmanned and maybe thats a good reason no spacecraft survived the landing, or ecplains why not a single spaceship hs touched down on Venus in more than three decases. And is why Astonomers have also wanted a safe mission to go to Venus. And it is also why its a challenging planet for humans to study,which is like is said before why NASA has been wantiing to find good ways to study Venus. Another project taking us back to old technology us ""Mechanical Computers"". These computures were used in World War II,and these devices were used to make calculations andby using gears and levers and it did not require elctronic at al. Modern computers are enormosly powerful, flexible and quick but tend to be more delicate when it came to physical conditons. systens that use nechanical parts can be made mire resistabt to pressure, heat a and other forces.

So Venus is a worthy, despite of the dangers and earth abd beyind should not be limited by daners abd doubts because uou shoild be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginatio and innovation. Meeting the challenge to study Venus has value but not because its interesting but because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimitdating endevaours.",3,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"The Eletoral College should stay because this has been the system that has been used for years in the united states and i dont think that it would be respectful to the ones that have been choosen by this system. Most of the people who dont like this system of voting will most likely say that we the people dont really know any thing about who we are voting and that most of us who are voting for someone are just voting for them just because we have heard good thinds about them. I'm not going to lie and say that none of the people who do get to vote are all voting because they know their stuff about the candidates, but some of us who do know about the candidates and how they are working should not lose the right to vote for who ever we would like. If we dont get to vote for who we like and believe is better then what type of country are we.

If all of the states would have same electoral vote then things would be harder because we mostly at some point will have a tie this would cause major problems but since every state has a different number it is not likely that both candidates will end up with the same number of votes. Another reason people dont like this system is because most states have a winner takes all system where they dont spilt up the elector votes if most of the votes are for one candidate then he will get all of the votes from that state. This causes lots of people to rage on the Electoral college because they feel that the state is taking there right to vote and to be different.

The other good thing about Eletoral college is that no certain region can win a election so this makes candidates campaign in states that they no they can win. This also is something that people do not like because for example when the canidates were Obama and Romney and lets say he put alot of his campaigns in new york this would cause the new yorkers who are going with Obama to get mad and start to protest because they arent see anything from Obama so they might turn to the next candidate. This actually helps because when people favor someone this makes it even harder for a tie to happen in the election.

Many of the people who are going agaist say that we are not voting for a president that we are voting for a slate of electors. This is true but if we are voting for electors that are going to vote for the president that we would like its  just like voting for the president there is not difference. Some people who are going agaist Elector college use this to trick people and make them go agaist it but if you know about Elector College this wont happen.

Elector College should not be taken away in any matter because this is the easiest, best, and oldest way that we have of picking the new leaders for our country.",2,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"In society today transportation is neccessary to keep most things going. Cars are one of the biggest transportation devices used. The advantages of limiting car usage range from taking away stress to lowering air pollution.

Stress is one of the biggest factors faced while driving. Continuously having to check for cars around you, looking for open spaces to race by the car infront of you, and waiting in those horrible traffic jams that waiste useful time in your life. Reducing the amount of car usage will lead to exercise which reduces stress and less waiting time for multiple things. As stated in source 1, paragraph 3 a resident of Vauban says ""When I had a car I was always tense."" Mentally driving is a lot to handle and always has you worried no matter how comfortable your car is.

A really big problem in our environment today is air pollution. Reduced car usage leads to less gas having to be drilled from oil mines and places underground. It also comes with a bundle of less smog and a stronger, cleaner, atmosphere. Even a businessman in Columbia commented ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" in source 3 paragraph 24 as he participated in the annual car-free day. The better the environment and air pollution the healthier the oxygen.

The very first servere danger, the author explains is in paragraph three as they get into the specifis of the sulfuric atmosphere as stated "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"" this line shows that this dangerously corrosive gas creates a huge problem for the space program NASA.

"Limiting car usage can prevent accidents and deaths by cars. Experts say passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent ofgreenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas like the United States. If people took their bike or walked to their destination it could help people lose weight and be healthy.

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifiying smog. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

Car-free day became a big hit in Bogota, Colombia. The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin america city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor.

Cars should be cut down in use in many other country's espically in places like the U.S where cars are used all the time. Experts say America's love affair with vechicles seems to be cooling. Miles driven in the U.S peaked in 2005 and has been dropping since according to Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.

There are the many reasons and what places are doing to reduces the usage of cars.",1,2,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Dear our state Senator,

I am writing to you for not only myself but for the citizens of our state. I do not agree with The Electoral College and I think that our way of voting for president should be based off of popular vote. I know our state and our country has been using electoral college as our way of voting for a very long time throughout our nations history. But Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrrational. and i'll tell you whats wrong with the electoral college.

As you may know we do not directly vote for our president. we vote for our electors who will (hopefully) vote for the president we want. when the time comes for voting the state legislature are technically responsible for picking our electors. We the people are not always in control of who they vote for and the electors could always defy our will. We do not always control who they vote for. So is it really fair if we vote for an elector who doesnt even support us and our say in who we want to lead our country?

Another reason why i do not agree with the electoral college is for the smaller states. they do not have as much of a say in who runs our country like we do. luckily we are one of the biggest states along with california. but in smaller states they almost have no say at all. they dont even see campaigns because no one running for office pays attention to the smaller states. For instance, The campaign in 2000 seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all.

One of the biggest faults in the electoral college even though it is very unlikely but not impossible is a tie. As you already know if there was a tie the election would be thrown to the house of representatives,where state delegations vote on the president. because each state casts only one vote, the houses selections would hardly even show the will of the people. the people would barely have any say whatsoever. does that seem fair to you?

Those are the reasons why i and many other citizens do not agree with the elecotral college. its unfair to us , the people, and smaller states. America is known for being the country of freedom and choice, but if we the people barely have say in who runs our country, are we really elligble to be called that? thats why i think we should use popular vote as our way of electing our president.",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"I dont't think that we should use the Facial Action Coding system in school. It's messing with the privacy of the kids who come into school and an ivasion on their personal space. I don't like the idea that a machine would be watching you and trying to find out how you are feeling.

There is a good side that I see to all if this as well too.

For example, it could be used to help a person who is depressed or really sad. It could help that person talk it out with someone and get the help they need, It can also catch a student while lying to a teacher. Despite these things, I still think it is like invading on someone elses privacy. It could also malfunction and say that the student is one thing but really isn't. Things like that could lead to alot of misunderstandings and confusion as well. It's okay to use it on objects like, paintings but, I don't think it would be such a good idea to use it on humans. A person's emotions is their own and not always needs shared with other people. If they want to express how they feel, then they will. If they don't then they don't. It's the student's choice. I don't think it would be fair to any of the students if it does become okay to use this. I wouldn't really feel comfortable that machine in the classroom at all.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology should not be used in schools or on people for that matter. I think that if we want to say how we feel then we do it ourselves. We shouldn't have to let a machine do it for us. I feel that it shoud only be used on objects. Even though it is a pretty neat machine, it still shouldn't be put in schools.",2,4,0,2,1,2,1,2,2
"As an American citizen, I am aware that cars are a big form of transportation. For me that is my way of getting everywhere. But I never really thought about the consequences of driving a car or even that there may be advantages to not driving one. Other countries have realized that their are advantages and are working on promoting citizens to use other types of transportation. Through out the world many countries are pushing for ""car-free"" areas and eventually ""car-free"" countries. Many of these countries are trying different strategies to accomplish this goal. Some examples would be Paris, where they only permit certain cars to drive each day depending on their license plate number, as found in source 2, parts of Germany are creating ""car-free"" communities and if you want to have a car you must pay 40,000 dollars in order to park in a parking garage in the front of the community, according to source 1, even Cities in Colombia promote what they call a Day Without Cars, as said in source 3. Even though here in the United States we haven't enforced any laws against driving, some citizens are choosing to not to drive. These countries are creating these new lifestyles in order to prevent air pollution, take away the stress of driving on the roads, and to bring the communities closer together.

As many people may already know, cars release greenhouse gasses that are harmful to our enviroment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for up to 12 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions into the enviroment."" Parts of Germany are working to solve this issue by creating ""car-free"" communities. Some of these communities house up to 5500 residents. This change is getting a positive reaction, with more people moving into these commmunities than predicted. This is a movement called ""smart planning"" which is a trend that is growing and sreading into many parts of Europe, some parts of the United States and elsewhere.

Paris however is trying a different strategy that doesnt require people moving into completely new areas. They are now enforcing laws permitting certain cars to drive on their designated days. For example, on Mondays drivers who's cars have even-numbered license plates must leave their cars at home and find a different form of transportation for that day or else they will be fined 22-euros($31). So far 4,000 drivers have been fined. Paris's goal is also to cut down the emission of harmful gasses into the enviroment but mainly trying to reduce smog. Since deisel fuel is a large contributor and the majority of the vehicles in Paris run on diesel fuel they are cutting down the number days you are allowed to drive.

Colombia is also using Paris' strategy, but their ""car-free"" days are limited to once every year. Colombia has been using this stategy for 3 years and each year getting a better turnout of people participating. Violators who choose to drive on this day known as the Day Without Cars day, are fined $25. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation, interaction between citizens, limit individuals stress levels, and reduce smog. Heidrun Walter, a citizen in Colombia quoted, ""When I drive my car I'm always tense. I'm much happier when I'm not behind the wheel."" Haidrun is just one of many citizens who have expressed their interest in this new method.

After looking at the consequences of driving a car, and seeing the multiple advantages of not having one has changed my perspective on things. I know the feeling of being stressed when driving and I've always thought, if I could I would choose a different form of transportation. After seeing other countries promoting their citizens to choose alternative forms of transportation, I now hope the United States will enforce something similar. Not only do you help the enviroment but it is safer for yourself and everyone around you. Living a lifestyle with no air pollution, stress, or traffic jams will be safer and more efficient. Hopefully every other citizens perspective on this will change, if it hasn't already. I'm lookinf forward to seeing you walking next to me on the sidewalk.",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3

to him .

Their are many reasons why some people want to be a sea cowboy .

Some people could of just signed up for no reason .

You had a chance to become a sea cowboy because in europe and other countrys were left in ruins. This was to help the countries recover their food supplies animals and other important things the need. 44 nations came together and formed the UNRRA ( united nations relief and rehabilitation administration.

What do you have to do if your a sea cowboy ? The sea cowboys take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. The first time luke got on the cattle boat their were 335 horse being shipped .

Luke was always busy caring for the animals during crossing.

They also have to chack on the animals hourly .

How long do the trips take and when would you ever get the time to have fun. It took two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states and a month to get to china.

How would you not get sea sick from riding a boat that long ? luke got to see some amazing sites when he was riding the cattle boat .

Luke also found time to have fun on board. The cowboys played baseball and vollyball in the empty holds where the animals were . This was after the animals have been unloaded also table tennis tournaments , boxing , reading,and whittling and other games also helped pass the time.

So after all being a sea cowboy isnt so bad .

"The advantages of limiting car usage is very important to the enviorment.

Citizens of the United States spend so much money on gas every day, every week, every month and all this money will eventually adds up throughout the year, imagine how much money you could be saving without paying for all that gas?

First off, having no car will save you thousands of dollars. You could even live a happier life, in the article it states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, said Heidrun Walter ""(In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars)."" This tells you that with no car you can live a happier life, you don't need a car to be happy.

You could have much more money in your pocket to spend on other things that maybe you could never buy when you were wasting all you money into your gas tank. Problem solved, GET RID OF YOUR CAR! To live a ""car free"" life you have to want it and stop pollting the earth.

Second of all don't you want to get rid of car trafic? Having a car doesnt benefit youat all, it only hurts you. Cars pollute the air you have to pay inurance, car payments, gas money. In the article ""(Paris Bans driving due to smog)"" states that cars are being towed and over 4,000 drivers are being fined for their car. ""Tweny-seven people had their cars impounded for their reacion to the fine"" (Paris bans drivig duet o smog).

Cars leaving the streets in bogota helped out alot people don't want to be fined for having a car so why not just get rid of it.

"How the author support his suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is, venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to sopt.

Venus is the secoynd planet from our sun.

Venus is also referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is also the clostest planet in distance.

Venus is sometimes right around the coner in space terms, humas have sent numerous spacecraft to land in the cloud-draped world and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.

Venus has not been touch by any spaceship for more than three decades.

The article also said, ""on the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 8-- degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not ecceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

"Why would scientist want to travel to one of the most hostile planets in the solar system? The author of ""The Challenge of Exporing Venus"" explains by listing the reasons why we should, listing the challenges, and saying possible solutions to those challenges.

So, why should we explore one of the solar systems most hostile planet? Well, the author explains that, at times, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. It is considered to be Earth's twin, because both planets have similar density and size. It also could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. It has similar features geography such as valleys, mountains, and craters; scientists believe that, long ago, Venus was covered in huge oceans and could possibly support life.

This planet, that used to support life, is now hostile. The author tells the reader that the atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide, has sulfiric acid, and has an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. The surface also has it's problems. The surface averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. There are also erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning striking the surface.

The best solution for these problems is a blimp-like vehicle. This vehicle would orbit 30 miles above Venus. It would avoid all of the surface's challenges. It would be cooler at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure would be equal to Earth's sea level. This blimp would be solar powered and could possibly have simplified electronics made of silicone carbide. The author adds that simplified electronis will not be the only technology onboard, there is a chance that mechanical computers could make a comeback, as they are more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

The challenges scientists face have solutions, and the solutions can help scientists make new discoveries of a planet that remains unexplored. The author has explained why we should explore Venus, despite how dangerous the mission would be. They give the reader reasons why we should, such as possible life forms, and the author has more pros than cons. They also says solutions to the cons that scientists face.",2,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2

I wouldn't trade anything for those adventures. Anyone can have this experience, after all, I was just a small town boy.

Another reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy is that we have so much fun. During our long voyages, we play lots of games. After unloading the animals, we played baseball and volleyball in the empty holds. To pass the time, we would have table-tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, whittling, and even reading. We just did so many fun things together, the trips didn't seem to long. Before we knew it, we would arrive at the docks, ready for another journey out to seas.

These journeys were more than adventures, but brand new worlds. If you don't understand what I mean, then you need to. But if you do, You should know exactly what I am trying to tell you. You will experience feelings you have never had before. I love to travel and do new things. This is just my passion, what I was meant for.

In conclusion, I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy has been a great experience for me, and could be for you too. Mabye this message was for you and inspired you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, mabye it wasn't. It is okay if this didn't convince you to be a Seagoing Cowboy, because I know this job was meant for me, and many of you out there in this world.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2

dangerous if they dont add enough details about it, but im getting off task from the topic of this essay so yeah. Yeah im for using this tecnology in school because the teacher could be able to tell

if just by looking at a computer to see if the class is instrested in the matarial the teacher is teaching. That way they will be able to change their plan of attack while trying to teach the class how to do the work. and there is just so many benifits with this teconolgy, teairler the artical said tha they could even be use to tell if someone like a major celebrity or politician is lying so just imagaing how far this teconolgy could go just by scanning you face to see how your feeling or even just to see if your lying all just from your faical expressions.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The author supports his idea on why we should study Venus despite the dangers it presents is because acording to the story Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Another thing the article says is that Venus is the closest planet to Earth beause of the density and size. Venus also used to be covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.

I think we should study Venus despite the dangers because it used to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. We can also study it so it can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but it will take a while to get there. There are also downsides like how will people live in Venus if it is too hot for us to live there or it'll still be hard for researchers to study Venus because researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else because they cannot touch the ground otherwise they will burn. There may be some solutions to study Venus a little bit more because according to NASA they have an idea in which it involves a vehicle. It will look like a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. The vehicle will be hovering over Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Although the temperatures will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure will be a little strong, it will still be survivable for humans.

Those are the reasons on why I agree with the author suggesting that we should study venis despite all the dangers the planet has.",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Dear state senator

I think having popular votes would be better 3 reason why I say this is because Electoral Colleges has selection of electors witch makings them vote for the President/Vice President. The second reason why i pick popular is because when it is Electoral Colleges voters vote not for president but for slate of electors and thats who picks the president. The last reason why we should vote by popular is because Electoral College is unfair.

To start off with why we should have popular votes is because Electoral Colleges process consists the selection of the electors and has a meeting with the electors where they vote for the President and Vice president. Electoral Collegeonly consists of 538 electors but majority of 270 is required to elect the President.

Another reson why i picked popular voting is because with popular votes the citizens are voting for who they want to be their President and who they want to be their Vice President but in Electoral College electors pick and vote for who they think would be the best President for instance if you lived in Texas and want to vote for John Kelly you would have to vote for slate 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kelly in Electoral College but in popular voting you could  vote for anyone you wanted to and not someone who pledged that person.

The third reason why popular voting would be better is because Electoral College was unfair, outdated, and irrational and had lack of democratic and is also a turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their states like them knowingtheir votes will have no effect witch makes them pay less attention to Electoral College voting.

This is all the reason why the state senator should choose populae voting over Electoral College voting.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"My position on driveless cars is that I am against the develpment of these cars. It too dangerous, not reliable enough and the prices will obviously be too high. The negatives in my opinion outway the postitives. There just isnt enough thats telling me its something right to do.

I feel its too dangerous, which will lead to lawsuits. If accidents happen the blame will be hard to put on someone. Drunk driving and texting is still happening today and if someone isnt paying attention accidents could happen.

And you cant always trust technology. Even cars on the road today have malfunctions with technology. If the technology fails its likely to scare others. More people would be hesitant to buy them.

The article stated a rhetorical question that was ""why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" Which is my question too, people enjoy driving. To me its relaxing and gets my mind off things. It seems quite boring. If someone wouldnt be driving they'd use a taxi or limo, which is why we have those.

And lasty, how much will it cost to manufactor these cars? How long will it take? Just like hybrid cars, the pricing will be too high for anyone in the middle class or below to even afford these types of cars. The advancement in the technology tells me they wont even be manufactored fast enough. How often do you even see a hybrid car driving? I dont think peoples interest in these will be as much as manufators are expecting.

In conclusion, driverless cars are too dangerous, not reliable enough and too highly priced for everyday use. I think we are a society becoming way too dependent on technology. The thought of all cars taking control scares me. There isnt enough postive aspects for driverless cars.",3,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,2

The Face was actually found by NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, while it was circling the planet. It was on the red palnet caled Cydonia. Now at first all they saw was just a shadowy shape. It took about 25 years as you can see in the pictures, that they ould process out of how the shadowy figure actually looked.

"The brightest point in the night sky, otherwise know as the planet Venus, is a very difficult place to discover. In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author talks about the dangers that exploring Venus brings along with it. The author supports this idea well by sharing the pros and cons of going there.

Although there are many risks, it could help scientists better understand how common Venus and Earth are. The author states that Venus' ""temperatures average over 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These conditions are very extreme for any human because we aren't exposed to that type of heat and pressure at any discovered place on Earth. However, in the fourth paragraph, he says that Venus might have been ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" and that it ""still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Although these reasons are good for scientific purposes, the risk poses a huge threat for the way that NASA chooses to explore Venus.

The author supports this idea of exploring Venus very well by giving both pros and cons for exploration. They give facts about the climate there while also giving examples of how to avoid these dangers. He knows that Venus has value so the shouldn't stop them from finding out more from this cloud-draped world.",1,2,3,2,1,1,2,1,1
"In the article ""The challenge Of Exploring Venus""

He didnt even say anthing about studying Venus, only why we should vist. This author did not write a good article on why we sholud study Venus.

The author talks about and explains all the details about venus and its dangers. so why would anyone want to go there anyway. In the past he states "" becauase Venus is somrtimes right around the corner in space terms, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on ths cloud draped world.Each previous missoiion was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". So thats a good reason not to keep sending spacecrafts and studying because its to dangerous for anyone to go there anyways. We probably wouldnt be able live because its more extreme than earth and it would be a big challenge to even try to live there. The talk about the dangers of Venus more the positive thing about Venus. He states that ''On the planets surface, the temperature averge over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater the what we experiene on our own planet.'' People wouldnt want to live in a place that hot anyway so why even study it. Venus have worst eathquake and more.

In conclusion the athour states many thing about Venus, but never gives a good reason on why we should study Venus. He really only talks about the dangers of Venus and not the positives about the panet.

"The make of Mona Lisa smile will be tough because she had 2 percent of anger and 9 percent of disgusted. Mona Lisa is only at 83 percent happy, so she need to remove those anger and disgusted. People makes many emotions, so they can express how they feel. When people are in a fight, they showed their anger which include emotion. Eckman have many basic emtoions, and it can also associated each with characteristic movements of their facial muscles.

First, people have many different emotions. Most of humans would have trouble describing each favial trait. Whenever someone tightens their lips that mean that they are in anger. Computer can recognize the subtle facial movements that human use to express how they feel. When someone make a movement of one or more muscles that is called ""action unit.""

Then, many characters can make a movements of facial muscles. For example, when you are surprise, you have your mouth open and raises your eyebrows. Each expresseion that people makes is compared against a neutral face. Muscular action units indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one.

Finally, making a communication with others will also showed your facial expressions. You can tell how your friends is feeling by looking on their faces. Computers can tracks your facial movements and expressions. Computers stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. For example, computer can recognize when you are becoming confused or bored.

In Conclusion, Making a facial movements and expression while communicating with others is important because it will tell the others how you feels. Mona Lisa don't smile often, but the computer can make her face smile by using the imagery. Facial impression and movements are not just for communicating it can also be in while looking at someone or reading a books.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The people, the people, the people that's all you ever hear presidents talk about. ""I care what's best for the people"" or ""It's the people's vote"", if that's true though then why do we still have the electoral college. The electoral college is a creation of our founding fathers and yes it might have worked then, but times have changed. The electoral college is now just taking away the people's votes, has the 'disaster factor', and because of the electoral college many canditdates only focus on swing states.

To start, if it's all about the people then how come our votes don't count. Instead of voting for the president we are voting for who the electors vote for, if they even follow what we say.  Although the exerpt from ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" disagrees with me, in paragraph 18 they give the perfect example to prove my point. In the 2000 election of Gore and Bush, Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still had fewer electoral votes. In other words the people voted for Gore, but instead we got Bush! So if it's all about the people of this great country then why did we not get our choice of president.

Next, the 'disaster facter' is described in source 2 otherwise known as the excerpt from "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"". In paragraph 11 it talks about how in 1960 the segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature tried, and nearly succeeded, in hand picking electors who they believed would be opposed to Kennedy. So what if next time do they succeed and the vote doesn't go the way the people want. As if that isn't enough reason, also in 1960, Hawaii sent two slates of electors to Congress! Luckily, President Nixon saved the day or that could have been yet enough fiasco the electoral college created.

Lastly, when canidates know for sure they don't have a states vote or even that they do have a states vote they tend to not visit those states. In source 3 it says that it makes them a more successful president because they don't only have regional appeal. However, it also makes it so they aren't connecting with every regional only the swing states so what about the states that are for sure to one canidate do they just not get to hear from their future president? The idea of an electoral college is making it so only certain states get to talk to the canidates and that's not fair.

In sumamary, why do we need the electoral college if all it does is cause problems. You could say that there's less of a chance of the larger states over powering the ones with less population, but at least then it's in the peoples hand what happen. The electoral college takes away the peoples power, has the disaster factor, and the canidates ignore certain states. All in all the electoral college is causing more problems then we need, let's finally make the election the people's vote.",3,4,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Driverless cars are on the rise in the U.S. Lots of different car companies are trying to continue the development of driverless cars. I personally think that they are a great idea, and their are many reasons why i think that. A computer driving the car is safer than a human, if a plane can go on autopilot why can't cars, and last but not least, the human in the car can take over any time.

I think that if all computers were controlling cars on the road it would be much safer than all humans controlling cars, and this is why. People get distracted on the road all the time. Other people in the car, their phones, things happening outside while they're driving and some people even drive drunk! The computer will never get distracted by the surroundings, giving it ultimate focus on the road. All the human has to do is stay alert and make sure they're ready to take over when they need to use their human skills.

Planes are put on autopilot all the time, and the people that make driving laws think driverless cars aren't safe. If that's the case, everybody should be scared for their lives when they get on a plane. Planes are put into autopilot a lot, and have no problems. Sometimes, autopilot flies the plane smoother than the pilot. The driving laws think that people will not pay attention to the road with a computer controlling the car, but even when they're driving people still dont pay attenion to the road 24/7. So with a computer driving it, you atleast know something is watching the road.

The last thing i have to say is that when the computer can't handle a situation, the driver can take over at any time. When the person needs to take over, the car quickly alerts the driver so they can handle the situation. GM developed a seat vibrator for when the car is about to back up into something. Other options are flashing windshield lights and even the cars having cameras so they can watch the driver while the driver watches the road. So work zones and accidents wont be a problem,

The three things i have said: Autopilot, a computer driving is safer, and the fact that a human can take over any time are just a few of the reasons they should allow driverless cars. Soon they will be a big thing in the U.S and around the world. Automakers are continuing the development of them and soon they will be on the road. I know i'll be getting one.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Today, technology in classrooms is huge. Almost all classrooms use technology nearly everyday. However, not everyone of them is effective because they are easier to slack off on without having a human to tell them to continue on even after they are bored, tired and even confused. Dr. Thomas Huang decided to create a system to help with this problem. He made a system called FACS or Facial Action Coding System. This system on a computer, reads emotions that on displayed on peoples face.

There are 44 major muscles in the human face. Each one of these muscles helps researchers find new ways to read emotions. Dr. Thomas Huang is one of these researchers. Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"". He means by this that because there are so many different muscles in your face, and them all being able to show different emotions, there is an endless amount of expressions to be made. For example, you can probabaly read your friends face and see what kind of day they are having by reading the emotion on their face. Unlike the smart Facial Action Coding System, we are not able to completely describe each facial trait showed by our friend, although we can still tell their state of emotion. For example when using FACS, researchers were able to tell that Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry.

It is thought that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could help students better in the classrom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Haung predicted. He also stated that if the FACS could recognize taht on students faces, it could also modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor would. Dr. Huang also states ""Most human communication is nonverball, including emotional communication,"". Even though this system could prove to be effective, not all students are only learning on computers and are learning verbally from a teacher. A teacher is unable to identify the exact percent of each emotion you feel but can still read your emotions just as your friend would.

Nick D'Alto, the author of Making Mona Lisa Smile, gives us an example of demonstration we could try. ""While looking in the mirror: 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling ('crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. 3. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes."". By having a partner guess which emotion your are portraying, he is doing as the FACS would. Your partner probabaly would have guessed happy. The computers would have been able to tell that you are feeling happy, and continue on with your work. However, if you were to have been looking confused, the computer would stop, and try to help explain the problem to you.

The computers could very easily help in the classrooms to make students work to the best of their ability. By being able to read emotions, the computers will make it harder for students to slack off while previoulsy it would have been moderatly easy. Humans perform these face ""calculations"" everyday without realizing it. Now the FACS system can join along with us and then some by creating a better work environemnt for the students.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"I think that driverless cars are good and bad. A car that navigates its own self, doesn't need a driver to take control of it, uses less fuel, and is controlled by a computer is most likely to be our future. We all want to do greater things, invent grather things, but we should also realize that some things can be thought of but not created. A driverless car has its ups and downs because if no human being is in control it could represent a bad aspect or a bad one. One good thing that comes to the top of my head is elderly people. This would be really useful to the elderly, especially because of muscle or bone aches. It reduces the number of crashes but could also influence them. The computer or whatever is controlling the car could misfunction or something could go wrong, therefore the car could end up crashing or causing an accident. Humans have the most control on a car. They decide the speed, direction, their surrondings. A computer could do thst too but not as acurate as a human would. Yes it is a very interesting thing thst could happen in the future but are we sure that we would want a machine to take over rather than a human. There are lots of arguements that can be done about this. Some people may agree, some people may not and thats fine because we all have different opinions. Driverless cars still have a long way before they can just change what has been achieved for more that maybe 80 years or so, and thats humans having full control.",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"I do not believe that driverless cars should be legal. Cell phones already make us unaware of the world and what is going on around us, why would we lose even more of that awareness all because people are lazy.

This would be giving people even more time to be on their phone.

The quote from the article ""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" There are so many dangers of not having to pay attention to the driving, what if the driver fell asleep and didnt notice the alert? What if the car malfunctioned and didn't alert the driver?

This invention is accidents on accidents just waiting to happen.

Also the article states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?""

This car wouldn't just be bad for someone's safety, the manufacturers will be sued and have plenty of lawsuits filed against them.

I disagree with the use of driverless cars.

They are unnecessary and unsafe.

Electronics aren't perfect, phones that don't mess up haven't even been made yet, how can they expect people to put their lives at risk for something they can do themselves. They are an accident waiting to happen.",2,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever been bored in class and need something interesting to learn instead of your tedious teacher lecturing you the whole class? With the new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"", it can recognize your facial expressions and tell your emotions. This technology can be very useful in the classroom because It can tell if you are interested in the topic that you are talking about, Also it can tell if you are disinterested in the topic and need a little spark of interest, and lastly it can maybe even tone the learning down if you are too confused or getting angry to understand what is going on.

With all of this abundance of new technology coming in the future some of them can be used for our academics. With this new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" we can use it to improve our test scores, and starting to put interest into kids in school. Within the text it says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-hapiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". This shows us that Dr. Paul Eckman has made technology that has the potential to recognize if people are interested in school. Also, with this technology it could provide feedback to the teachers to see how they are doing with their students in class.

This technology could also be able to tell if someone is doing poorly in the class because of disinterest. Dr. Huang says in the article, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" What Dr. Huang says can alter the way that kids learn very dramatically. If you have a bored or uninteredted kid in your class the computer can recognize it immediately and change his/her lesson so that they are able to learn better without being bored.

Confusion, anger, and depression can also all be a factor on a child's learning, but with this new technology maybe it will be able to understand when they need to see a guidance councellor for help. Dr. Huang continues to say, ""Most Human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" ,and he also says, ""so computers need to understand that, too."" What Dr. Huang is trying to say is that this technology can also help us with things that we don't want to talk about to other people. For example, if somone was having family problems at home and it was effecting their school work the computer would be able to recognize that this person was very depressed and can get them the help they need within the school.

Technology is evolving and we should be using it to its full potential of helping our future look brighter by increasing our academics with this ""Facial Action Coding System"". This new system could help out many students when they are in bored, confused, angry, depressed, or even interested in what they are learing. With all of the feedback it can help these students learn more efficiently.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"This technology is a good idea to all students in a classroom who is feeling different emotions. The technology is helpful because it can indicate on when a student is feeling, for example sad and if the teacher see it they talk to the student and know why is the student feeling happy or sad, angry. The Facial Action can also be helpful with computers if they know how if we are stuck on something in class like a lesson or or assignment its like what Dr. Huang says or his prediction ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'' ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' This means even on the computer can calculate his or her face them changing their motion or expression. Also, computers can calculate how you change your muscles to indicate which emotion your feeling at that moment like in the article it talks about how your muscles movements move, ''For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your're surprised; your obricularis oris (around your mouth) tightens up your lips to show anger.'' This shows that with these movements of characters it can show what kind of emotion a student is feeling in a classroom.

Also, this technology isn't what probably students want in a classroom because some students probably dont want their faces to be be modify or sometimes some students dont have no emotions like in the article it says ''The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,'' observes Dr. Huang, ''even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression'' this means that the someone probably have little emotions or expression in their face. In classrooms students who are bored show it mostly with body language which makes the face change expressions if the lesson is boring.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"To all my fellow citizens, I must tell you about all the spectacular things cities are doing. They have started giving up their cars to decrease the congestion and pollution rate. The cities that have already tried it have seen a huge benifit.

A little community in  Vauban, Germany was the fist city to let go of their cars. Residents say they feel much less stress than when they had cars. What a suprise that not having to worry about traffic would reduce stress. It has also drastically reduced tailpipe emissions. They're have been rearangments by stores, they have been relocated along public sidewalks so that people no longer hae to drive across town to the mall or stores. They can simply walk or bike down the road to pick up whatever might interest them.

The next place that picked up this amazing wonderful idea was none other than the busiest city in France; Paris. Paris ordered its citizens to leave their car at home, and if they didn't comply would pay a 22-euro fine. 4000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine, but if I was able to buy a car and not drive then I would be among those who would have their car impounded. On the bright side congestion went down 60% which is amazing for one of the busiest cities in the world.

The next place thats wanting to pick up this no car trend is none other than right here in the United States, and were supporting it. Each year that goes by recent studies have suggest that Americans aren't buying as many cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses. If this pattern progresses it could solve our atomosphere problem. If huge cities and like Paris,Vauban,and The United States will give up cars. Than that alone could drastically change the path that our planet is headed for.

So citizens I hope this encourages you to cut back on your car usage. Take the bike out every once and a while or just walk. Whats the worst that could happen if you limited your automobile usage.",3,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,2
"In the article of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it is suggested that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of thinking the dangers it presents with it. It is also been refers to as the Earth's twin due to density, size, and even distance. Even with Venus being called the ""Evening Star"", the dangers is still out there. Still, NASA is working other different kinds of achievements on studying and learning about Venus.

""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to oland on its surface."" This explains almost everything that could happen in Venus. No one particulary knows what even is on Venus, only for a fact that it is one of the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system. ""Therefor scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This explains how almost scary it is to ACTUALLY learn and study about Venus. A LOT of things can happen during the mission to Venus.

We can still make an mission to Venus but that is going to take out A LOT of us. More safetiness and equipment is required especially if you're going to a planet that has the hottest temperature of any planet in the solar system. It is interesting to see how scientists are going to work on the mission to Venus, and especially their safetiness towards it. We can still work, discover, and learn new things about Venus.

"I see driverless cars both dangerous and useful. They can help the dissabled and many people who can't drive at diffrent parts of the day.

People that would have driverless cars would be both lazy and easily angered at the car. The lazyness would come from the fact that they just have to sit in the car, and the anger would come when they had to put their hands on the wheel when the car wouldn't be able to drive its self.

The cars would need the human to direct it in the correct way at times it can't and the humans would be angry at the car when this happnes. Also the humans wouldn't see the point of having to take a driver's test. The humans would be angry at the licencing branch and the branch would go out of work because they don't have to test people.

Honestly, I think this would only be good for only a small amout of people, however if only a select few can use the cars the other people that can't would be angry. I think this could be harmful for the population, but this is only my idea others might find it helpful.",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Luke's point of view on convincing people to go on this seagoing journey is he wants to go on this wonderful cattle boat journey.

He doesn't want to miss out on this great oppurtunity to go on this trip.

He knows it is an oppurtunity of a lifetime because his friend is encouraging him to go, but he doesn't leave home.

He can't resist the temptation so he goes anyway.

Luke knows it is a very rigorous job to do but he knows he might be able to help a lot on this trip that's why he goes.

Lue loves this experience on his adventure to Europe.

Luke is veer convicting on why he goes on this adventure. People want to participate in this because Luke liked this journey so many other people might.

When Luke has to check on the animals each hour he has to make sure he has to chech on them very painstakingly to make sure every animal is there.

When Luke breaks his ribs that's when you know that all of his jobs are super rigorous to do and work.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Today there are programs like NASA that are always looking for ways to explore our planets next to us. We have already sent probes and rockets to mars for exploration, but in over 30 years we havent sent one space craft to Venus, despite it being called ""Earth's twin"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, but it is the one of the most inhospitable planets that humans can step on. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports his idea well by explaining the benefits of exploreing Venus despite it being so cruel for humans to walk on.

In pargraph three the author quotes that, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experence on Earth."" The author first explains the inhospitably of Venus to then explain that when we adapt to the conditions there are plenty of benefits and knowledge to gain from the planet. In pargraph four the author quotes that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author explains us the value of exploreing Venus to include the fact that there could be life forms we have never saw before that have lived only on Venus. Comeing back to how the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers.

In pargraph five the author explains ideas NASA has that could eventually take us and machines to Venus. he quotes that, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

The author adds the quote in beacuse he wants to reinforce the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers. But he also looks at the downsides to hovering 30 miles above the landscape, citeing that from souch a high distance light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere and that researchers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anthing else, from a distance. The author supports his evidence by looking at bolth sides of the problem and offering possible solutions to them.

He contunes in pargraph seven citeing other NASA approaches to haveing machines last longer on the surface of Venus. That if by useing mechanical computers and simplifyed electronics made of silicon carbide they can withstand the heat alot longer. In comparson to todays modern electronics which don't use gears and levers that can be built to withstand heat. The author cites this beacuse he wants the reader to know NASA is thinking of possible ideas of sending a durable machine to Venus, to withstand the chaos of the surface and send data back to people on Earth.

In ""The Challenge of Exploreing Venus,"" the author supports his idea well that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He first explains what the dangers are like. Then explains all the benefits of exploreing Venus. Lastly he explains ideas on how to overcome the challenges to send people and machines to gather data about Venus. In conclusion the author wants the reader to know the benefits of exploreing Venus are greater than the challenges and dangers on the surface of Venus.",4,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,1
"In this essay in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System I was talking about how are the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First on that time some computers are creating to recognice emotions, in the text say, "" Mono Lisa at least acccording to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" She was according that she wanted to find ways to humans express they emotions, but later the Dr. Huang was developed a betters ways to humans can be communicate with others. In the text say, "" Dr. Huag and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humas and computers to communicate"" this mean that the Dr. Huag he is trying to find how calculate the feelings of humans and he is a expert at developing a computers that way people will be have how they communicate with others to the place and another pleace.

In addition this process begins with a cumputer 3-D this was called an "" action unit"" this is how they is trying to find how are the humans emotions. The Dr. Paul Eckman was a creator the FACS ( Facial Action Coding System) he creater this, then he classified whats are the emotions that he is trying to has. In the text say, Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic of the facial muscle."" This mean how the Dr. Paul uses this six category to see how the students express their emotions. I think that this is help us because they know when the students are sad, fear, happy , anger or samething like the Dr. Paul saids. These emotions is classified to find the emotions of people.

Now the new emotion they use in people and then they compare with the real face , in the article say, "" Using video imagery, the new emtion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa,"" and "" Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" they use videos imagery to show the emotions when they use the creation that they creater to see how are the ractions, and then they compared against the neutral face with the face that they have.

Also there is a lot ways that they have to use in emtions but not all the ways are express the same ways. Some ways that they use are bad beacuse some humans don't wanted that people know their life and another humans wanted that they help them to find their emotions because they don't know how they feel or how are their emotions.

When they uses with students is so confused for them. Students is becoming confused how Dr. Huag predicts, in the article say, "" A classroom computer could recognized when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Haug predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The same make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" this mean that for some students are boring but fr the others students are good and they used one and other ways to recognize the emotions and finally they found and they know when the students used a lot the computers to compared animated face or something like that.

In conclusion I learn that they are different ways to humans express their emotions that is hard for the Drs. to find the emotions for recognize how humans feeling. Also this ways a lot of students use to compared their emotions with someone else.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many things that could go wrong with the way we the United states are voting now which is why we should use election by popular vote. There are many reasons why we should switch to popular vote but there are three that are most important. The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, it would be less likely to get a tie, and the canidate would have to campain in every state because there wouldn't be a winner-takes-all situation.

Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote. The reprsentative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. Geoerge W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency.

Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. In the event of a tie meaning that each canidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the oppurtunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House.

Furthermore the canidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winner-takes-all which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party. The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state.

In conclusion the President of the United States should be elected by popular vote because a canidate would not have to worry about winning the popular vote but losing the election, the possibility of a tie would decrease, and the canidate would havw to campaign in every state. These are just a few of the many reasons that we should switch over to a popular vote system, plus who wouldnt wan't to have a little more say in who runs our magnificent country.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"I support "" The Facial Coding System""

because, it would help with alot of different things going on in school. Like for example it could tell what kind of mood the student is in so the teacher could know how to approch them wihtout the student "" going off."" This would even help with knowing if the student gets the lesson the teacher is teaching by thier facial expressions.

Like i said it helps with alot of differnt things, the author says, "" hold on, can we acually ""calculate"" emotions."" yes we can, its a ""smart computer"" & its like a person. I say its like a person because, say you see your friend and he/she has a frown on her/his face. You auctmactly know theres something wrong because he/shes frowning & thats also what the computer is bacislly doing.

Like the author said "" whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions."" Faces dont lie and your feelings cant hide. I say that this invention would be great also because of children that get abused at home, & when they come to school they're getting bullied here too. So this is why i support "" The Facial Action Coding.""",2,4,2,2,0,0,0,1,1
"The development of a human contolled car is not the reason for the cars not being far more advanced, but the safety of the drivers and passengers. The cars would make everyday life more simple and less stressful, but the cars would have to be more and more carfully programed and very well tested, to ensure they don't cause harm to the driver and its self. If everybody drove in an driverless car there would be less recks and seafer conditions; but it would be very expensive.

The materials and costs would sky rocket, gas companies and bio-fuel makers would be very unhappy becasue they would lose there jobs. The roads would also be very risky to work with. traffic jams and heavy pedestrian activity would have to be very important; The sensors would have to be top of the line and have a very sensitive trigger for response.

In recent years the cars have been more and more technologically advanced. Radar and mapping have become much more adapt and are being updated much more frequently.

There are many conserns people may have, but the cars have come a very long way and are becoming even more capable each day. They may not be the best idea right now but in the next decade or so will be obsolute .",1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Can I imagine a world with driverless cars? Yes, I can. Do I think they are a smart idea? No, I do not. I do think there are definitely some pros, but the cons are greater. They could have a glitch, cause accidents, and lose control.

I don't think they are a smart invention because they could glitch. What I mean by they could glitch is, they could just stop driving for you without you knowing and die on you. Possibly causing you to crash. Therefore, it is not safe.

Another reason I don't think they are smart is they could lose control. Yes, they do warn you when you need to take over, as it says in paragraph 7 of the article. But, what if you don't hear it? Or, it stops working and it doesn't let you know you need to take over? What are you supposed to do then?

The last reason I think the driverless cars are not smart is they could cause lots of accidents. Yes, normal cars have accidents as well

but I think driverless car accidents would be much worse. They would be worse because of all the computer pieces working in such a big device could cause it to possibly blow up, causing all othe surrounding cars to overheat and blow up themselves, the car could lose control an crash into another car.

Also, the car could also malfunction and do the opposite of what you want it to do. With a normal car, you are in control. So, most of these things are less likely to happen.

Now that I have shared my opinion with you, what do you think? Do you think they're a good invention? In paragraph 8 of the article, it even says safety is their biggest concern. So, what do you think?",2,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with this suggestion because I feel that studying Venus could help us find out if there was once life on the planet, considering it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. I know this because the article states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This means that their could possibly have been life and human-like creatures just like us.

Although it is a difficult planet to study, scientists find it interesting that there is a planet similar to Earth in many ways. In the article, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". This supports the authors suggestion furthermore because although Venus is a dangerous planet, it is sometimes our nearest planet, which means it would take a shorter amount of time to get there. Not only would this be a wonderful planet to explore, but humans are also very curious to find out what is on the planet Venus and what it has to offer. I say this because the article states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".

In conclusion, I feel that there are many amazing things that could come out of us exploring Venus, instead of giving up because of the obstacles we are faced with.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Are cars even really necessary? Vehicles can cause a lot of damage to our ecosystem. Cars are not a must if wherever you need to go is right outside your door step. Rush hour will cease to exist if cars are not in use. Some advantages may come forth if vehicles were limited.

Cars produce pollution that endangers our ecosystem. Countries are taking action in order to save the greenhouses. Paris had enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. According to Robert Duffer, author of ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" he stated in paragraph 14 ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" Duffer also mentioned that Diesel fuel is responsible for this.

Why use a car if you're going down the street? In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 6, Rosenthal mentions that stores are placed a walking distance away rather than near a highway or somewhere you have to use a car to get to. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Other countries are introducing this motive as well. ""Vauban (Germany) is an example of a growing trend... to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning.""

Nobody is a fan of rush hour. If cars aren't being put to use then rush hour will fail to exist. Andrew Selsky, author of ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" implies ""... rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic...""",2,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,2
"In many different countries, driving and the use of motorized vehicles have decreased in the past few years. We have come to learn the cars cause pollution of the atmosphere and the creation and release of greenhouse gases. These deadly gases have led to global warming and the decrease in our atmosphere. We've learned that if we stop using cars and find other, more environmetally friendly ways of transporation, that our contribution to the pollution will decrease ten-fold.

Greenhouse gases consist of CO2 and other chemicals that come from fumes from cars and other forms of exhaust. They are mainly from cars and motorized vehicles. These harmful gases eat away at our atmosphere. We cannot replenish our atmosphere so we have to try and preserve what we have leftover. Therefore, if we cut back on the use of these vehicles, we won't destroy our atmosphere as much as what we have done in the past.

Along with greenhouse gases, smog is also another problem. Smog is a mixture of the fog and moisture in the air combined with exhaust from cars, smoke from cigarettes, and other toxic fumes. We have to have smog checks on our cars at least once a year to see if our vehicles are protected against the chemicals. Smog can be prevented somewhat by halting the use of vehicles. Also, if we don't use cars, not only will we have less smog, but we won't have to pay for the annual smog checks. We'll be helping our environment and helping our wallets.

Don't you hate it when you're stuck in a traffic jam when you're trying to be somewhere on time? Of course, cars are faster than walking everywhere but if there are people in front of you not being able to move because of the people in front of them and so on and so on, then walking would cut the time of sitting in a car and waiting 10 minutes to move 5 feet in half. Most people hate waiting. Also, if we walk, not only will the pollution decrease, the obesity of our country will to! Think about that the next time you start to munch on a bacon cheeseburger.

In the United States, people have begun to lose interest in driving. According to Source 4, less and less people are driving, buying cars, and recieving their licenses. That means that come the next century, our carbon footprint will be half made up for. More people want to walk to lose weight and be able to hang out with friends and colleagues. If we don't stop using alot of fuel, we'll have more money for things that are more important. Motorized vehicles are making us and our economy suffer. Maybe, if we cut back on car use, we'd have more money to bring back our electives and music programs in our countries school systems.

So, overall, if we cut back on vehicles, our lives will be so much better. We wouldn't have to be so paranoid over gas prices. Our air that we breath would be cleaner and our money would be saved. We'd also have less worries about finding a cure for weight-related illnesses. Our country would be perfect without cars.",2,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,2

"With technology advancing you can drive your own car like how you see them in the movies. Technology is advancing to the point of driverless cars and they will be seen more in the near future. Though severl might think that having driverless cars can be dangerous, the technolgy advancing will make it to where you might not have to buy a car in the future. Driverless will be safe to drive on the roads even without a driver.

Sensors on the car can keep you from danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors are nothing new, but with the technology advancing since the 1980s automakers can make a car that allows far better responce and control than a human driver. With futher improvments on computer hardware and sensors, automakers can design car that can handle more driving tasks on their own.

The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.

BMW has already annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.

Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future.

Safety is the number one key to the adevances of driverless cars. From sensors, antilock brake and driver assistance systems, and development for the advanced technology; automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety. That is why they are developing the technology further to insure that consumers are safe while they have made technological advances.",3,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2

The face that has formed on the earth over the years is just a natural land form. I think it is just a natural landform because you can see in the pictures up above how it changes of the year. The face changes of the years because the way the land movement is. You can see that it has not been put there by somone because the way it has changed over the years that it has formed.

The reason I think it has formed over the years is because if you look at the pictures look how much the formation from 1998 to 2001. If it was put there by someone, it would of been alot more clear that a someone made the face. The face appeared because of how the land moves.

"Dear Florida Senator,

The Electoral College system is unfair and irrational. Some people would say that the process is more practical than a popular vote, but after some of the mistakes involving the system, it would be more accurate than popular vote.

Bradford Plumer brings up in his article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong the incident of 2000 (otherwise known as Bush v. Gore.) Over sixty percent of voters wanted a direct election instead of the Electoral College. Electors can always defy the wishes of the people. IN 1960 segregationists almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would opposed John F. Kennedy. Electors have refused to vote for their party' candidate before and have just chosen their own to vote for.

Source one says that in most states there is a winner-take-all system meaning that if one elector gets a majority of votes, then all of the states electoral votes go to that candidate. This is unfair to the voters. If there is only a 100 vote difference and the one with the most gets the electoral votes. The presidential candidates do not even visit the states they know they have no chance in winning. In the election of 2000 neither Rhode Island nor South Carline saw the candidates.

The Electoral College system has flaws. Such as the incidents involving electors and the unfairness of winner-take-all. It is unfair and irrational.",2,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,1

"Do you want to help other countries? In the process you can see, and take a tour through the ruins of great places. That's what Luke in, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" did. More people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

If you join you would be helping countries after World War II from all over the world by, bringing them horses, young cows, and mules. You can help nations rebuild since World War II destroyed a lot of land. I know this because in the text it said, To help these countries recover their food, supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) Some may argue that sending all of the animals overseas might reduce the animal population in that country that is sending them away. But really we have enough cattle in places like America.

Also joining will give you an oppurtunity to visit all of the ancient ruins of a great city. The author wrote, ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special."" On the other hand people will say that they have already seen the Acropolis or China or Europe, but the countries\cities are fascinating.

I do think we should keep the Electoral college because it gives a chance for even electors to vote.

when we vote we are also voteing for electors to work with the presidents and help him make desions. Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that "" The single  best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor"" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states. what a lot of people dont know when they vote they are also voteing for other electors.

A lot of americans do not trust the Electoral College because they feel its not right to also be chooseing electors at the same time. they feel it is unfair and not nesscary. They should have sepreate elections for electors.

Richard A. posner qoutes that ""When you vote for a presidential canidate you're actaully voting for a slate of electors"" (source 3). Alot of people do not like the sound of that because they think its kinda like a secret.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Think back to the day you got your license. The thrill of being able to drive and knowing how much more independce you would have. You want your kids to enjoy that experience too, right? Well what if that all went away because of driverless cars. I am against driverless cars because, driving helps you learn responsibility, the technology could fail or malfunction, and liablity arguments would arise.

When teens learn to drive they are given the rules and regualations. Remembering these rules and following them is their responsibility. With driverless cars the drivers or people in the drivers seat would have less responsibilty because they do not have to do as much work. In the article it says that the driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and break themselves. Since the driver has to do less they may not always pay attention becuase they would think it is the cars job to handle the driving. Carless drivers would make people more lacidazicle about driving. Driving teaches people to be responsible, without this how will we instill responsiblity into the people on our roads?

In todays society new technologies come out everyday. However, we know how frusterating technology can be if it doesn't work. If our Iphone or laptop glitches it usually isn't a big deal. It can be fixed in an instant, maybe even by yourself. But what could the consequences be if a driverless car glitches? While you are driving you don't really have a minute to google how to fix your car like you can do with an Ipad. Just like any new technology a driverless car could have malfunctions, but these malfunctions could but peoples lifes at risks. People may say that even today with people driving cars that there can be glitches in cars. However, since real people are driving the cars they can evaluate the situation and control the car.

If the driverless car does fail whose fault is it? The ""driver"" or the manufacturer? This question will definetly come up if driverless cars come into our society. If you get in a crash, but weren't in control of the car, how can you be blamed? This problem could to lead to new laws, many court cases, and law suits.

Driving is a right of passage for teens today. Driverless cars, while could make life easier, would just bring more problems and arguments into our already technology filled lives. Driverless cars should not be legal because driving teaches responsibilty, the technology could fail, and cause arguments over liability.",4,4,2,4,1,2,2,2,2
"This could be it, the new Facial Action Coding System ! This system is a very unique way to tell and spoil how you are really feeling and what your emotions are. This new system starts with a 3-D computer model and all of the human muscles. It will basically scan your face and tell you your emotions. I think this is a fantastic way to get people to change there mood or to tell how people really feel because people hide there emotions and this system could be a new big thing.

Some people may not agree on many things, but maybe people could try this. Some adults worry about how student or there children are feeling and if they did the Facial Action Coding System it would be a way to express there emotions and tell how they really feel. It's as simple as a fake or real smile, the rising of an eyebrow, or even the squinting of your eyes. All of those qualities can tell you what your emotions are with using the Facial Action Coding System. Like the passage states, "" The Mona Lisa demomstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face "", and so could the FACS. Seeing student down isn't pleasent and shouldn't be. Using the FACS is a way to tell, but don't put on a fake smile !

The Facial Action Coding System could go world wide and change lives. It could go to every school and make a difference ! This system could be valuable but some people may see it different. Not everyone would want to do this because some don't want to express there emotions. If schools invested in this system, it could change those that don't want expressed to being expressed and happier. It could also just tell you where your're at and what emotions you could work on or otherwise. Some may like, and some may not. Reasearchers show the putting on a ""

Real Smile "" can make you happier and change your mood. The science of emotions could be a thing of the future, but even more so with the Facial Action Coding System.",2,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"In 1945 world war two was going on in Europe. Don Reist invited Luke Bomberger to go to Europe. When they got there Luke and Don both sighed up to help with the animals that were shiped overseas.

In the story it said, in August 1945,Luke and Don bolth got there orders to go to New Orleans. Luke and Don arrived they day the war ended. the they went to greece Luke turned 18 before arriving at greece and Luke might be able to get drafted foe the millitary.

Accroding to the text, By the time Luke was drafted he had already made 9 trips the most of any seagoing cowboy. Luke was traviling from the Atlantic Ocean to the eastern caost of the united states. Luke said it took about two weeks to cross the Alantic Ocean and a mounth to get to China. Luke was carring for the animals that were crossing and they had to fed and waterd two or three times a day.

the animals food had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship so they could eat. Luke was prepard for this because he had to help out on his aunts farm.

Conclusion, On one rany cold night Luke was on watch to watch the animlas and he went to go tell the captian the report and he slipped down the ladder and had cracked ribs.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

I know all this because the text says. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for luke bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""i'm grateful for the oppurtunity he says. It made me more aware of people of other countries and their need's.

Another reason is the text says. It took about two weeks to cross the atlantic ocean from the eastern coast of the united states. And a month to get to china. It also says Besides helping people. I had the benifet of seeing europe.

The text also says But seeing Acropolis in greece was special he says. It also says Luke turned 18 before ariving in greece. It also says so was taking a gondola ride in venice italy. A city with streets of water those are a few of the things to do. And it also states To help these countries recover their food suplies animals and more 44 nation's joined together.

That is why people should join the seagoing cowboy's program. You get to help people in the darkest times. Like after war when they have almost no food. You get to go to beatiful places and see beatiful things. Like china the Acropolis in greece Italy Europe. This is why people should join the seagoing cowboys program.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The reason is, Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Even though Venus is despite the danger it presents studying can helps in thr future. The study might not help now but when something happned on Earth, it surely will helps and will be worth it. Even if it doesn't help, studying and knowing good. Paragraph 5 says ""Not easy conditions, survivable for humans.""

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions of Venus are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. However, peering at Venus from a ship or orbitting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere.

In Paragraph 8, it states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should expanded to meet the very deges of imagination and innovation.""",1,3,3,1,0,1,1,1,0
"My position on driverless cars is, I'm totally against them, why well because they could cause an accident if the computers or sensors on the driverless cars fail or malfunction then that company that manufactured the driverless car will have a lawsuit coming out and if the driverless cars fail a lot then it will cause the company lots of money if anybody was hurt during the accident because of the malfunction of the driverless cars.

I also think that when they have driverless cars then will be also having machines or something that will be all machine operated and no human would do it then we will be to relient on things that don't require anyone to operate it and it might be also a hassle having to constantly maintain the sensors and every part that will make the car driverless and it also be time consuming because what would you do if it won't behave and work properly and you would might have to spend lots of money on the driverless car cause if the parts are foreign made then it will cost more money to ship and buy that part overseas.

And that it is why I'm totally against driverless cars they are dangerous and they can kill if the computers or sensors or whatever fails on the car in a accident and people will be to relient on it.",2,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Earth as we see it today might be flat to most people and to some might be round, but that is not what i am here to discuss, i am here to talk about the planet called Venus.

Venus is the brightest point of light in the night sky on Earth any amateur stargazer could point to it,

it is also called the Evening star but Venus is actually a planet in our solar system which is the second closest to the sun but from hear on Earth it looks really calm and not much harm that could happen but it is a very rigid place.It is often reffered to as the twin planet of Earth since it has the same size and density of Earth.

Humans have sent numerous amount of spacecrafts to land on this cloud draped world but no spacecraft has lasted more than a few hours because Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets Venus, to make the matters worse the clouds are highly corrosive sulfure acid in the atmosphere and the planets temperature avergaes over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the planets atmospheric pressure is far more greater than what we experience here on Earth.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration(NASA0 want to test a theory of theres by sneding humans over to Venus, since the planet is like fire to every sinlgle thing over there on ground they would send jet airplanes to avoid risking anyones life and to stay away from the surface.

NASA would like to take samples from the surface like the rocks, gas, water and so more but they cannot get the materials from a far enough distance they would have to moe upclose and take the risk of stepping on the surface.",0,1,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"The article talks about Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois working in collabration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam developing a software that can read people emotions. They have tested this software on the painting of Leonardo da Vinci's painting called Mona Lisa

In the aritcle it talks about Mona Lisa ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

This could tell us how the students are feeling about the topic that they are working or they are about move onto. This could also tell wether the student has a question or let us that the student might not understand the topic. If schools use this software, our numbers in passing the test could go higher up.

"Many people have cars its there way of transportation however there are places where there is no need for a car, and not having a car has its advantages.

In source 1: in German suburb, life goes on without cars says that ""vauban streets are completly car free."" the reason for this is that there streets are filled with bicycles and the wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. In the United States the Enviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. the reasoning of this is because there is less space for parking. The United States are promoting new communities that are less dependant on cars. there saying private owned cars by the burgeoning middle class are chocking cities. :80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport.

"Mars, the Red Planet, has been thought to have lifeforms living on it for many years now, by many people. Yet there is no comfirmed evidence that there is life on Mars, or that there was life on Mars. The ""face"" located in Cydonia, is not a face of anything at all. It is only a mesa. That was naturaly occuring. If there was any life near the ""face"" on Mars, then the Mars Global Surveyor would have found something.

I know what you are thinking. That NASA is hiding the fact that there are lifeforms or where lifeforms on Mars. If there were, then NASA would have told the world by know. It would help NASA if there was life out there in space. The picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took in 1976, was to low of a resolution to be seen clearly. In 1998 when another Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia the crew snapped a picture that was ten times sharper than the origional Viking 1 photos. Revealing that the so called monument was a natural occuring landform. Yet many people like yourself, where not satisfied by this conclusion and thought that NASA was covering up the fact that there is or was alien life on Mars.

NASA then prepared another mission to capture another image of the ""face"". NASA planed this mission for a cloudless sunny day in Cydonia in 2001, so they could get the clearest picture possible. NASA would not risk more money and lives if they already knew that there was life on Mars. It makes no sense. The team that went to capture another photograph, captured one that was the maximum resolution. It would have captured anything that looked out of the ordinary. Including lifeforms and anything they may have left behind.

All of the facts point towards the face being a natural landform and not made by anything but nature. The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a mesa which are comonly found in the American West. One photograph showed what looked like a face. The other two photos, which were taken with better cameras at a higher resolution, show a mesa. The facts are showing that the ""face"" is not a face at all it is a naturaly occuring land form.

If there was any signs of life, past or present. The Mars Global Surveyor would have found something in 2001. All of the facts point to having no lifeforms build this stucture on Mars. If there was any thing out of the ordinary with this mesa then it possibly could have been built by extraterrestrial life. But there was and is nothing out of the ordinary with the mesa. It is the same type of landform that occurs in the Western part of the United States of America. NASA would not cover up alien life if it was benifical. It is like you burning your money. It helps no one. There is no life on Mars and the ""face"" that you saw in 1976 is not a ""face"" made by lifeforms. It is a naturaly occuring landform.",4,4,3,3,1,2,1,3,2
"In countries such as America, Germany and Europe air pollution is high and one of the main reasons of that is fuel coming from a truck or car. Cities such as  Vauban, Paris and Bogato realize that their atmosphere is full of pollyion and have decided to make a changer of that. Although people may not give up their car for a long periiod of time, even just a day makes a huge impact on their atmosphere.

In hte citie of Vauban, Germany you will not hear the loud sound of a car engine very often. This citie is very unique and residents of this upscale community are what we call pioneers. Street Parking, driveways, and garages are forbidden in the community of Frieburg. The streets of Vauban are ""car free""  except for the main thoroughfair where you can catch the tram to downtown Freiburg and a couple streets on the edge of the community. If you are to own a car their are two places to park, large car garages at the edgeat the edge of a development which wil cost you 40,000$ to own a spot. 70% of Vaubans families do not own a cars, and 57% sold a car to move here.

In Paris, France they nearly faced a record pollution due to excess driving on several days. To put a stop to it the city enforced a rule that on mondays even-numbered cars were permitted to not use their vehicle and on tuesdays odd-numbered cars were too not use their vehicle. If the people did not listen and use their cars on that day they were given a fine of 22-euro (31$). Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of the idea of non-vehicle use.

Another city that believed in non-vehicle use is Bogato, Colombia. On this certain day, Colombians used their bike, skatebaored, walked or took busses to get to work. This left the streets of the capital city clear of all cars except for buuses or taxis. This has been the third straight year that cars have been banned in a citie with 7 million people. The goal of this trend is to promote alternative transportation and to reduce secrete pollution in the air. Along with less air pollution parks and sportes centers also have bloomed throught the city; eneven sidewalks have been replaced with  more broad, thicker sidewalks; rush-hour resrtictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new resturaunts and shoppings districs have cropped up.

These particular cities have seen dramatic changes due to their no car use belief. One day a week of no vehicles can make a change on not just your city but on yourself also. If every city folowed along with these cities we would find ouselves in great shape when it comes to pollution in our atmosphere.",1,2,3,3,0,0,1,1,0
"I most defintely agree with the scientists behind the Facial Action Coding System. By having the ability to read a student's emotions the world of education could make huge strides. By simply altering a lesson to fit a child's personality, the lesson could become more enjoyable and less challenging for the child.

Dr. Huang predicts that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" If Dr. Huang is in fact right about his technology's potential, children all over the world could become better educated. From my own personal experience I know that when the lesson deals with something I am less interested in I become bored, but if the lesson metions something I enjoy, then it becomes ten times easier.

Dr. Huang also says that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This is one of the most important lines in the article. By saying this, Dr. Huang opens up a world of oppurtunities for his technology. Many teachers around the world would agree that their students when talking, commuicate more with their emotions than physical words. These teachers would be able to know how their entire class was feeling as soon as they walked in. This would enhance the teacher's teaching style for the day ,and increase the students learning oppurtunity.

Dr. Huang's final arguement is also very important. He says when reffering to nonverbal human communications that, ""Computers need to understand that to."" Dr. Huang believes that computers must learn to read the human emotions, and I agree. This generation is becoming more and more about technology, and most schools have converted completely to technology based schooling. If every school had the ability to use the Facial Action Coding System, the intelligence of this generation and generations to come would continue to grow exponentialy.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a huge new technology that would make huge improvements to classrooms. Its ability to recognize emotions would not only benefit students, but would benefit the teachers of those students. The intelligence of our generation and genrations that preceed us will continue to grow with the use of FACS.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This would enable computers to identify human emotions. Say you were looking at ads and you didn't like one ad so you frowned, the computer would be able to detect that and it would show you something different, but if you smiled then it could show you something similar to that ad. This new technology would be very helpful and valuable in classrooms.

Being able to use this technology in classrooms could be such a help for some students. Since now majority of schools use laptops in the classrooms or they go to computer labs to work this could be a help. There are a lot of students that are afraid to ask their teacher for help when they don't understand a probelm that they are working on because they feel embarrassed for not understanding something that most of the class in understanding. Having this technology in class that could read your facial expressions while you are working could be a huge help. The technology could be able to tell if a student is confused, nervous, or any other emotion while he or she is working on the lesson. The computer would be able to continue going at the pace it is going while going over the lesson, or be able to slow down its pace if the student shows expressions of not understanding what is going on. The technology could even recognize when the student is becoming bored of the lesson and it could be able to make the lesson more exciitng. The technology would be able to modify the lesson with any type of facial expression.

Some people might argue that they don't want their face to be read by a computer because they think that the governement could be watching their children, but once they see that their childrens grades have possibly improved because of this new technology they will change their mind. This is why this technology would be valuable in classrooms.",2,3,0,3,1,1,1,2,2
"Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States. I believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president would be best bescause first the more people who vote its easier to determine who would become president and because it will aviod any problems having to choose for president. Changing the election by popular vote can change things in the united states.

Now a days  alot of things have helped the electoral college but in other cases it has not . Changing to election by popular vote can help by choosing the winner and still having its defenders. Also it may help by when they need to find out the winner they know exactly who it is . They can get their election faster and quicker by changing the election vote to the most popular vote for the united states. People still suggest that keeping the electoral college would be better but chnging it to popular vote would be the best option .

Presidents and electors have had trouble with the eletoral college when having to elect for president of the united states . If changing it to popular vote for president it will sviod any troubles and problems when electing the president . They will still have senators and still have enough votes to choose and elect the president and have no problem at all. Like people may think yes , electoral college should stay and should not be changed to popular vote in electing the president but i think that is best . Everyne has their own opinion in matters like this but in this case i think whats best to change the electoral college .

In conclusion to this everything is always done for the better and i think that changing the elcetors to popular vote for the president would be easier and less problems for alot of people. Making change is better and helps others. Especially if its changing for the elections and having to do with the president . Everything is better if you choose to elect the president by most votes it creates better things and makes life so much easier .",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"have u wondered wat is that face on mars? Is it proof of life or just a natural landform, well i am here to tell u its just a natural landform.

Its a juts a natural landform because in the story it says NASA unveiled the image for all the see and the cption noted a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadelows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth making it look like proof of life on mars. If u need more proof on april 5, 1998 the MOC team snapped a picture tens times sharper than the original viking photos. thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform.

"I am all for the development of such cars. Cars like these, can save many lives. Who wouldn't want a driverless car when you are too lazy to drive on your own. You wouldn't have to pay for a driver or a taxi ever again. These driverless cars will make lives easyier, save time, and will be much safer.

I still believe that drivers should still be able retain control of the car, when need be. Technology, even at its finest can sometimes act up, but if a problem were to happen there will probably be a fail safe. Just like phones, cars like these will probably be updated constantly, to make sure there are no bugs in the software.

With all the sensors added in on these cars, these cars will soon be able to detect more then us, things we wouldnt see.

These cars will save countless lives, reduce traffic, and make roads safer.

Driverless cars are still being worked on and they still have a lot of work to do before they are even considered to be realeased to the public. These cars would be able to find the fastest route, get out of dangerous situations, make quick decisions, Things we couldn't do.

"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.",3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Imagine cars driving themselves in the future. Envision a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. Think what it would be like to not drive again and have it done for you. The thought of having it all done for you, seems nice right?

I feel that driverless cars can be a good idea but a bad idea when it comes down to it. Think about it, who wants to drive around all the time when it can be done for you? But, opposing to that; traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Besides in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars. If driverless cars were to happen it would be a good idea to have new laws that will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident.

Also, if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? Driverless cars sound good and all but when it comes down to it there is alot at stake and alot of work to do on them. First you have to test the cars and test if there even functional/capable of driving driverless, make new laws, technology failure. Cause what happens if your in a car accident?

Saftey is a big concern when it comes to driving. So you should still be aware of your surroundings whether yu driving a driverless car or not.You never know what can happen. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

Driverless cars can be a good but bad idea. When it comes down to it, who really wants to drive all the time & such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. But the bad part of it all is the proccess. You have to think about your saftey through it all, the new laws, how to work it. It's all a big step. Do you think it's worth it?",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
well i think Driverless cars would be reckless and could be dangerous rather than helpful as it says in paragraph 2 it still alerts the driver to take contol of the car when backing up or pulling into places like garages and other things. Also As it Says In Paragraph 3 It reads binary code well in my opinion what if the car cant read the binary code one day what if it just malfunctions and in paragraph 4 it says it needs alot of sensors and a couple of video cameras. after reading this article i still think the who driverless car thing is a reckless invention and not a very good investment with our tax payers money so i really think driverless cars should not be invented and googe shouldnt waste their time on it.In Paragraph 6 it says something about antilock brakes well what if that just dont work and someone gets in a brutal car crash over that malfunctioning.,1,2,1,0,0,1,0,1,0
"The Face has many reasons that in may be from aliens, but there are also many reasons against it. How you choose your final answer will have to do with your world view. Your mind may change once you hear different information.

May 24, 2001 was when the Face was first spotted. There were no other other landforms or artifatcts spotted on this mission. This is the first problem. If there were aliens that previously inhabited the plant, why would there be no other evidence? The only factor making it appear to be an Egyptian Pharaoh was the shadows casted on the rest of the structure. Though Michael Malin was able to get closer,clearer pictures of the landform, it still did not give straight evidence that aliens exsisted. If the Face did prove that aliens did once walk Mars, why would they be Egyptian? Scientist can only compare the structure to what they know, which is not much. Since the Face is equal to a mesa or butte, how would that be possible? Mesas and buttes are not caused by man, but by erosion and natural processes. The Face was most likely formed by coincidence.

Though there is no exact explanation for the Face on Mars, it is still interesting. If you belived in aliens, you would believe in is an artifact left by ""Martians"". If you do not believe in aliens, you would simply believe it happened because of natural processes as if it were a mesa or butte. Without proper evidence, we are left to believe in whatever we would like.",1,2,1,2,0,1,2,2,1
"Im jacori and I am writing this essay to to inform you on my argument for driverless cars. I believe the idea of developing driverless cars was a brilliant idea. I think it will benefit younger adults or teens the most because it guides you and keeps you rolling. Also I think it would help nervous drivers and a person that learning how to drive. This could help some people become better and more focus drivers.

Based off my information in the first paragraph I do believe that the driverless cars will be very helpful and could save a lot of lives. The reason this is important is because it can prevent a variety of accidents and that will cause safer driving. Like stated in the passage, the laws they make focus on keeping drivers safe, passengers, and drivers, but the imagine being able to get to work and back fast and safe for the next two years, that what it will be like to have a driverless car.

Driverless cars can help prevent car accidents in all states, especially teenagers that drink or smoke, it can be a last minute life saver. Based of statistics we have hundreds of accidents all over the world within a spand of a week . These driverless cars can be a solution to that and they can initiate you to want to take more family road trips and have some family fun. Therfore, driverless cars should be invented as soon as possible before it simply just becomes to late.

The brilliance of the idea just lingers over my head like a lightbulb. You will be avle to drive more miles too because you won't be so tired from steering the wheel or pushing the gas pedal. If this invention is a success I think it will go down in history as the plan of a true genious. Also it will help you while driving through traffic so you will be more comfortable on the highway or expressway. According to the brillance of the idea and the appeal of saftey, I believe in the development of driverless cars.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something.

When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, and humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help.

As I stated before, each state has an amount of points based on the population, which in turn affect how much you help your desired party. Seems reasonable, right? You would think that the more the population, the more impact it has on the election. That's right, but it's also unfair because states that have noone living there could all vote for one party, but it wouldn't help that much, unless the points were close and that state tipped the scale. But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot.

In America, the people should be able to feel responsible for their country's future, and not feel as if their state doesn't matter. My own words might not be able to change peoples' minds, but I'm sure the votes aren't tied.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Limiting car usage would be a wise thing to do for the world, and places around the word have already started. In German suburbs there are fewer cars, Paris banned driving due to smog, there is a car free day in Bogota, and car culture is coming to an end in the United States.

To begin, in Germany people have given up their cars! This is a product of some of the new laws that they are enforcing on the outskirts of Freiburg. For example, street parking is generally forbidden. But car ownership is still allowed, if neccasary they can only park in large garages at the end of the development were you buy a space for $40,000! I deffanitly dont ever want to pay that much just for a parking space, and they dont either; 70 percent of Vaubans families do not own cars. On the plus side people feel more involved in their community when taking a bus or walking to were ever they need to go. ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter.

Moreover, air pollution is getting out of control. To help, Bogota has a car free day. Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid to traffic jams. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Piera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. The goal is to promote alternative transpertation and reduce smog. Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. [last] Week Paris had 147 micgrograms of particutate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in Lonon, Reuters found.

Adittionaly, greenhouse gas emissions are crazy.  Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer drivers licenses as each year goes by. But America's love afair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will- it will have benificial implications forr carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants. There has been a large drop in the percentage of 16-39 year olds getting license.",1,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Senator of Florida

Im sending you this letter to address you on that i am in favor for keeping the Electoral College. Having the reason being that, this process will be in a much acelerating rate of speed and less of a process to go thruogh. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. This entire process consits of the selection of thr electors, A meeting of electors sit and vote for the president and also vice president. This in my opinion is the best way on to vote for the president.

The Electoral Eollege consits of 538 electors. Our state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its congressional delegation. One for each member in the House of Representatives and an additional two for the senators. This will allow better flow of votes around the House of Representatives. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, District of Columbia is further more allocated 3 of the electors and is to be treated as if they were one of the state. For the purposes of the Electoral College, the reason for the word ""state"" does refers to District of Columbia.

Every candidate running for the president in the state does has his/hers own group of electors. These electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political parties. This gives the Electoral College a better way of choosing electors for the party. Just like every presidential election, they will all, take place every four years on the tuesday after the first monday of November. I my self as a well and loyal citizen and resident of Florida can also choose the states electors when i go and vote for president. Because when i do vote for my candidate i am voting for my candidate's electors.

Almost every state has a ""winner-take-all"" system, this will reward all electors to the winning presidential candidate. This one of the main reasons i do take in favor the Electoral College as a way to vote for the president. And then after the presidential election is done, the governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"". Then by it listing the ever single one of the candidates who has ran for president in the state of Florida. Along with the names of their respective electors who has been on their side during the whole process.

Then here by saying all i needed to say about the Electoral College and what has been brought to my attention of details of the Electoral College. Hopefully, some others will take notice for what i have sated here before you. They will to soon realize what in great inportance this is to you and many others to come for. Hope you have good day and a very well sleep tonight and my sincearest thanks for you being able to take the time and read the letter.

"The development of driverless cars is something new. People do not really know how to feel about it. Some people love the idea. Others, not so much. People are convinced that technology is a waste of time and cannot make our lives easier. What they don't realize is, these cars are actually pretty helpful.

Driverless cars are made to know that something bad is going to happen on the road before you do. They are designed to alert you when they see something you cannot. Some driverless cars can even stop themselves before you even get a chance to put our foot on the break. Driverless cars are designed to keep people safe and make our lives easier.

Driverless cars can greatly help decrese the amount of accidents that happen. There are accidents everyday. Some are even fatal. With these driverless cars and the advanced technology they have, can you imagine how much the number of accidents would decrese? These cars are designed to keep you safe on the road. Yes, these cars still need human direction on some things, but they are still able to keep you safe and worry free when drving.

Driverless cars have already been made in some places. They have been manufactured and driven by people who think that the idea of driverless cars is a good one. These cars have been tested countless times just to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Driverless cars aren't for everybody though. And that is ok. Some people just don't like the idea of having a car do everything for them.

If you do happen to have a driverless car or are planning to get one, don't think that you don't have to drive anymore. Yes, these cars will do a lot of things for you that you can do yourself, but they are not going to drive you to wotk everyday. They still need human guidance. These cars are desgined to watch the driver as the driver watches the road. So what that means is that, while your changing the radio station or looking for something in your backseat, the car will automatically alert you if anything unsafe is on the road.

These cars are pretty amazing if you ask me. But don't get me wrong, they aren't flawless. Technology is something that we learn more about everyday. So the more we know about technology, the more we know how to fix anything wrong that has happened. Especially in cars.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,2
"I believe that the negative aspects of driverless cars outweigh the positive ones. There are too many complications and problems that are yet to be solved. Driverless cars are a very unique and interesting invention, but I am not in favor of the development of these cars. There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly.

Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error.

I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars.

Lastly, driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. With this, you would need to figure out an effective way to alert your driver when their assistance is needed. If the driver could not be alerted, then this could lead to massive consequences. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This quote highlights the neccesity of getting the driver's attention. If in any case the driver was not able to be alerted, the repercussions would be severe.

In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars.",4,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Students should be able to use technology to show their emotions; because in the real word when you dont have anyone to talk to or no one is there for you. You could get on the computer and type your emotions out because sometimes it can help you out with alot of your feelings.

In paragraph 2 it states that

""Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at develping better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This shows that you could have better commuantion by just typing; its a better way to talk or show your emotions. Like when anyone is feelinf down, somewtimes people dont want to show there feelings or dont wont to talk about it to others so if you use your techonlogy to show you expressions; it will get better hopefully.

Just like in paragraph 6 it said ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotuonal communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that,too"". It might seem a little weird for you to show a computer your emotions but to me thats a great thing to you. its better way to use techonlogy. Some hate talking to people or even telling people whats going on because most of the time perople hate opening up in front of people or to a person period so typing could be an easier way to show their feelings or emotions.

And letting it out by easily grabbing a computer and typing no matter if your happy, sad, mad, irrataited. what ever the case may be using technology is a great way to show your expressions.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Technology in recent years has gone through many incredible advancements .In the past few years it has been making things that seemed impossible a reality. Things such as self driving automobiles. These wonders of technological beauty have the abilty to control and operate themselves without a driver. This is a truly marvelous feat that shows how far we as a society have come however this driverless cars should be seen as a mere fun idea. Driverless cars should not be used in our society as the will cause far to many proplems just so we can be lazy behind the wheel.

Making a driverless car is no simple feat it requires numours things to operate effectivly. One item that these cars require are senors and lots of them. Senors are used so that way the car can tell what is going on in

traffic. However what happens if one of these systems fail at one point on the road. That right a tragic accident will occur that could lead to the loss of lifes for no reason just because a stupid glitch occured.The senors may be tested to make sure they dont malfuntion, but so is everything in this era and yet gliches and mistakes still happen in all of our everyday technology.Our phones which are simple compared to a driverless car still have proplems all the time, and they have been tested and improved upon for far longer.

These driverless cars arent even truly driverless. Humans are still required to be behind the wheel to handle certain situations such as construction or road blocks.So whats the point of having one of these cars if at any point you can be thrust onto the wheel unprepared for what might be on the road at that given point.This fact truly ruins the convience of owning one of these cars as they fail to do their key function which is to operate on their own. These cars are also still only considered safe at 25mph which drastically reduces their overall usefullness to the consumer if they need to go anywhere at a reasonable pace.

Driverless cars also are not practical in todays time. Imagne how many new types of tech stores would have to be opened to keep the senors on these cars running properley. How many times a year would someone have to get these senors checked? More importantly how much would it cost to fix one of these cars? The awswer is that we dont no as these cars are untried and untested. These Cars also couldnt fit into our soceity where barley anybody will have the money to afford to keep one of these new cars.

Simply put driverless cars are intesting and facinating to watch. They are true marvels of the 21st century and show how far as a civilazation we have come. Thes smart cars truly are driving us into a new age of wonder and increbile ideas however the day when these cars are used in everyday life still lies far over the horizon.Driverless cars should not be implecated into our society because they are to impractical, expensive, and dangerous.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,0

"The limiting of cars in our community can help us significantly reduce pollution, save money, and improve health.

To begin with, the amount of pollution caused by cars has dramatically effected the enviroment. Acording to the text the capital of France in only five days of car smog. The amount of smog riveled to the smog capital of the world Beijing, China. That was only five days of car smog. If we keep this up, the  first the sky will turn black and then it will fall and world will end! Hopefully nobody wants the world to end because of smog. To reduce the amount of smog and pollution caused by cars we can all reduce the usege of our cars. Therfore, the limiting of cars can significantly reduce pollution.

Next, limiting cars can help us all save money. To illustrate, we all like that ""Cash Money"". And all cars need gas to work, and the funny thing about gas is it cost money; alot of money actually. So if the limited useage of cars happen then, is we save that ""Cash Money"". As you can see the reduction and limiting of cars can save us that ""Cash Money"".

Lastly, the limit of car useage can and will improve health by making people walk. You see people every where are getting over weight. So by makeing them walk or use other modes of transportation we can lose weight and improve health. Thus, the limiting the useage of cars can and will increase health.

"The use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" This is important because some students wont ask for help when they are confused or troubled. Secondly, more than often when a student is bored they will fall asleep causing them to miss important information. ""By weighing the different units, the software can even recognize mixed emotions.""So if a student is a little cofused the software wont make it ""just so easy"" but it'll reduce the challenge.

If uniterested in the subject at hand or with the class as a whole they will become unattached an fail the class potentially causing them not to graduate. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" By modifying the subject or lesson it could make it easier or make it harder for a student in class. If a person seems to be frowning the software could ease up. Also if the student is having a good time with the software it's a possability that it could make it a little harder.

Even people that dont use much emotion in their face the software will still be able to calculate their emotions. ""The facial expressions for each emotions are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" So if a student isn't very exspressive this software will still be able to calculate their emotions with the slightest movement of their facial structor.

"In many places around the world people own cars and drive around almost every day. But what many people dont know is that cars can release harmful gases that can hurt the earth's environments. Three reasons why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it prevents traffic, it helps the environment and your community, and we dont really need cars to live our everyday lives.

Limiting car usage in your community is good beacuse it prevents traffic. Everyday, people use their cars to go places even if the place their going to is down the street and that causes traffic some times. For example, in Paris there has been days of near-record pollutions due to traffic so Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from pollution. They said every Monday motorist with even-numbered license plate were ordered to leave their cars at home or face a 22 euro fine. This ban helped because congestion dropped 60 percent in the capital of France just after five days of the ban was set.

Another reason why limiting car usage in your community is good is because it helps prevent pollution to the air around you. Cars can release gasses that can harm the earths environment and the community around you. Which is why in the United States the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities much like the one in Vauban, Germany. These ""car Free"" communities consist of a small town where the usage of cars is illegal, you are not even allowed to own homes with a garge in it. This is very good for the environment and can prevent air pollution.

We should limit how often we use cars because we dont really need them to get around and many countries beleive so too. For example in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that was set to spread out to other countries, during this program millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. One reason why these people might have done this is because any one who violated this rule would have been fined $25 but the main goal for this was to prevent smog in their countries environment. The turn out however was huge! Even when there was rain it didn't stop them. The mayor of Bogota said ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating"" and now for the first time two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event.

There are many reasons why we should limit the usage of cars in our communities because it prevents traffic , helps the environment and because we dont really need to use cars so often , take Colombia for example. So lets take action and follow the steps that many countires and communities are taking to help our communities.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Nowaday, the world of technology is really big all around the world. People start to use technology for everything in their daily life. From their house, their school or work.

Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :""Facial Action Coding System."" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.

Here is how it works. According to the article ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about. That's help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.

The FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.",2,3,4,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Venus, Earth's ""twin"", has very harsh conditions. Unlike Earth, Venus is the hottest planet in our solor system. It has a very thick atmosphere, and the clouds are composed of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The aurthor of this article believes we should send mechanical mechines to explore this planet for all of its benefits, despite the dangers.

My first point, according to the article, is that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size. Geographically, it has valleys, mountians, and craters. The author also suggests that long ago, Venus might have had oceans and that Venus could support life. This is why some researchers see value in the exloration. But, it provides the question: will exploring Venus be beneficial? The aurthor thinks that yes, this is a good opportunity.

My next point is that the author also states that we have already had missions there. If Earth poured money into going there at all, more than once, we must have seen some value in the mission because of its potential data and learning opportunities. The crafts may have only lated for days, but we still were able to learn. If we we not going to gain anything from the missons, we would not have wasted time and money to get there, multiple times.

Lastly, NASA has proposed a way to avoid the dangers. The facts about Venus are scary to some, but what if we could safely send a probe or spacecraft to Venus? According to the article, it would have to travel 30 miles above the landscape. Doing so would prevent the corrosion, it would have pleanty solor power, and the machine would not overheat as easily. ""Striving to meet the challange presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endevors.""

This challange may help us, the Earth, learn more ablout habitable planets and how to care for our own planet.

As our technology grows, so does our possibility to go to Venus. It does not take a computer, it takes human curiosity. The aurthor of this article supports the possibility of going to Venus. Its informational possibilites, and its challanges are all positive things about the mission. The challanges are what pushes us, as humans further than we have gone before. Learning about Venus could help researchers, and the people of the Earth.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Some people may think that this is a conspiracy and they may believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens. These people say that NASA is just wanting to hide the fact that there is life on Mars. NASA responded by saying they actually wish there was life on Mars.

Even though some people think that this is a conspiracy NASA has given out many reasons, facts, and even proof that this face is just a natural landform. Probably the biggest piece of evidence would be the image from April 8, 2001 and it was taken by the Mars Global Surveyor. Scientists from NASA said that each pixel is 1.56 meters and if ther was life on Mars that this picture would show evidence. This picture is clear enough to see if there were huts or buildings, Egyptain like pyramids, or anything else that the ""aliens"" have made or built.

In conclusion, scientists from NASA have proved that this face from Mars is just a

natural landform and aliens did not create it. NASA has given many reasons and even proof that this is not made by aliens. Even though some people still may beieve that this a conspiracy and the face was made by aliens and that there is life out there on Mars, the face is just a natural landform.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"After the nice, relaxed weekend at the beach, Steve gets up to go to work at 6 AM to go to work that is half an hour away. His Monday morning seems to be great until he jolt upright, suddenly remembering about the end-of-the-month report he was supposed to do over the weekend. Steve scrambles around his house, quickly changing into his work clothes and shoving food in his mouth as he runs out the door. As Steve drives to work, he tries to think of ways he can get the report done quickly, but he eventually prepares himself for the verbal lashing he will recieve from his boss. Steve can be anyone. Forgetting to do work is a common occurance. Steve, however, could have gotten the report done if he did not have to drive to work. A relatively new technology that could have saved Steve from his boss' rage is the driverless car. A driverless car, obviously, does not require a driver most of the time. Google and many other car companies have been trying to perfect the driverless car by making the car not require a driver. There are many pros to driverless cars that far outweigh the cons. Driverless cars are more safe and saves time for the driver.

Every year, many people die in car accdients, whether the victim was the driver or an innocent pedestrian. Driverless cars can potentially lower the rate of car accidents. Unlike humans, driverless cars can detect objects around them with multiple sensors installed in the car. The Google-modified Toyota Prius uses nine sensors - ""position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel,

a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"" (Paragraph 4). Also, the rotating sensor on the roof, called the LIDAR, makes a 3-D model of the cars surroundings. With all of these sensors, the driverless car can detect objects or people that a normal human driver cannot see, as there are many blindspots that a human driver has to be wary of. Also, the car can also ""cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce the power from the engine"" (Paragraph 5) based on the information received from the sensors. This gives the car ""better response and control than an a human driver could manage alone"" (Paragraph 5).

Although the idea of a driverless car sounds appealing, the current cars developed do not drive the full amount of time. The cars needs to alert the driver in special situations like work zones and driveways. Therefore, drivers need to be alert the whole time just in case one of these special situations pop up. If you have to be alert the whole time, why not just drive in the first place? Also, what happens if the car hits someone? Would it be the driver's fault or the manufacturer's fault? There are legal issues that can be avoided if humans just drove the cars in the first place like they have been doing for the past century. In addition to the legal problems and the drive time problem, the car can become faultly, like a computer that got a virus. This time, the consequences of faulty electronics are much higher than just replacing a computer. The car could end up taking someone's life.

The current driverless car does not drive the entire time. However,Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan are expected to have cars that can drive of 90% of the time. Yes, there is a 10% chance that a human driver might have to take over but the 90% of the time that the driver is not driving, he or she can do work or just relax. Even if the driver fell asleep, there are many ways that the car can wake the driver up, like vibrating seats, sounds, and bright lights. Cars can be developed to become better at driving in traffc zones. The human instanct, however, cannot be developed to be more cautionous all of the time. Also, the legal issues do not present a problem. Laws often change to adapt with the times. Courts and lawmakers can debate on the issues, resolve them, and change the laws so that they can accomodate conflicts that the drierless car might present.

Driverless cars can solve many vehicle-related safety issues and lower the accident rate. Also, they give the driver more time to do whatever he or she wants to do. There are very little cons that come with the driverless car, and the ones that do come up can be easily solved. Driverless cars should be allowed to continue to develop so that eventually, they can replace humans drivers and make the roads mroe safe. Steve, too, can get a happy ending by frantically finishing is report while his new driverless car can take him to work.",5,4,3,4,1,2,3,3,2
"The Creation of the Thing

""Hold on! Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions-- like math homework?"" do you think that using a computer to deturmane our feelings is right? To me thats cool, maybe even unbelievable. Is the use of computers,emotions,and muscles the key to feelings.

Many people can't seem to find what feeling mona lisa is showing, sometimes you cant see what emotion your friend is having. Two professors have decided to invent a software which it can detect the feeling of a person or a painting. stated in paragraph 1, "" the software is the lastest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This shows that the professors are trying to invent and new and improve way to figure out emotions within the human and paintings. They are creating a software for the computers. Also stated in paragraph 3, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscle."" Not only can the computer detect the feelings, it also makes a 3-D form of the human face or a 3-D image of the painting.

Everyone has emotions but some you just cant tell how they are feeling, well now you might not have to worry about that i do believe that this software is going to be very valuable to the students, in very many ways. its going to help them with observing the way the looks and creses in the face is. Stated i paragraph 3, "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" There are many emotions but these are the most common. Also stated in paragrapgh 4, "" In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emmotions."" No matter what the person is feeling. if they feel sad, worried and happy all at once the software can still detect the emotions of this human or painting.

You know that it takes so many muscles just to frown, so why not smile it takes why less muscles. just by muscles you can tell the way someone is feeling. when someone is happy they get wrinkles by their eyes. Stated in paragraph 7, "" In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the coners of your mouth."" with just useing a couple of muscles it can add a whole different facial expression. Like if you sqint your eyebrows and then also smile and also close your eyes a little bit I know that i wouldn't be able to tell weather they were happy or angry. just by changing on muscle movement it can change the facial expression. Also stated in paragraph 8, "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" not only is this cool but its differentuse one other different muscle and people can tell that your smile isnt really and happy smile.

This software is a great idea to help many people just understand the emotion of others with the knowledge of computers, emotions, and muscles they will be able to know how anyone is feeling just by the three main reasons.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"An unusual face was spotted by Viking 1 in 1976. Looking at evidence that were provided, it shows that the ""unusual face"" found on Mars was just a mistake. Even though they had picture of the unusual face the first time they spotted, it was a really blurry one so it created illusions for people to make it look like there was actually a face on there. It was later proven by Mars Global Surveyor that it was just a natural landform on Mars using photography. Therefore, pictures don't lie which makes the ""unusual face"" just another natural landform.

In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, where the unusual face was found, to snap a picture of the unusual face which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos. Since the picture was pretty clear, it reveal what was actually there on Mar's surface. It proved that it was just a natural landform and that it wasn't any alien monument. People may say that since it's winter it was the cloudy time to of the year of for Mars so other things such as clouds could've had an effect on the picture but it doesn't change the fact that it's just a landform no matter how unsatified the people were.

In addition, NASA unveiled the image saying that it was just a huge rock formation. They noted that it resembles a human head because of the shadows. It was creating illusions for human eyes so they didn't see the actual object but instead they saw a face on Mars. Although, some scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact which was what got Mars Glbal Surveyor to even begin taking pictures of Mars to prove that it was just a natural landform. Overall, the face on Mars is just an illusion even though some people believe it's real.

However, people might think it's real. Looking at the evidence provided by the Vikings which was the first photo of the face on Mars, it really resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. Even a few scientist believed that it was an alien artifact and it even became a pop icon. It was starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and radio talk shows which mean people actually believed it. The face on Mars attracted many people's attention. Which is why people could say it's real since the majority believes it but what really matter is how it's proven. It was proven using a camera that snap pictures clearly. Everyone was later informed that it was just a natural landformed because of the picture taken in 2001.

In conclusion, the face found on Mars was just a natural landform that looked like a face because of a blurry picture taken by the Vikings in 1976. Many scientists and people believed that it was real but it was just an illusion to the human eyes. In 2001, Marlin's team took a snap of the face on Mars which prove that it was just a natural landform. Garvin compared it to the landforms on Earth so that people could understand and believe that it was just a natural landform. Therefore, the picture taken in 2001 was an evidence that proved that the unusual face found on Mars was just a natural landform.",3,4,3,3,1,1,1,2,1
"Since remotely times, the man had look for some way to make his life easier, since primitive hunting weapons, to carriages. The carriages were pulled by horses mostly, and on those times, the most that those animals could do for contamination was pooping but the owners had people to clean for it as well as someone who took care of it. While the times had change, the transportation media has too as well with the cars; which it actually result to be a doble sided blade contaminating with smog.

In Paris the government has banned driving due to smog, the smog has caused a huge impact on this city, giving to it cooler nights and warmer days, many habitants blame Diesel fuel, but it does not matter which fuel you would use, it would burn and produce smog anyways. On the other hand, Vauban, Germany, is offering a new life style that many people has decided to adopt; the suburbian comunity has no cars at the streets, people there does not own a car because they do not need it, the public transportation works very well, so it is not a primary need. They can live perfectly without cars, then they are not that necesary. Many people even sell their cars in order to move to Vauban, and had said that their lifes are so much less stressful than when they did own a car. Mothers can let their childrens to play in the streets without thinking that a car is going to kill them, and kids can let go technology if their moms want them to play outside; most of the kids are so attached to technology because it is a way that parents have to keep them away from the streets. Maybe these changes like in Germany were too radicals, but it can start by a day a year like in Bogotá, Colombia where once a year people take a car-free day, being buses and taxis the only ones allowed to produce smog, the violators are charged with 25 dollars fines. Even in the U.S., from 2003 to 2009 young people driving decreased a 23%, young people are considered the most dangerous driving people. There is so much for young people to do that they are not focused on driving, this could be the beginning of a new era, in April 2013 the number of miles per person was equal that in 1995 where the cars where less than right now. There it is even a program in New York promoting car-pooling!

But for example, here in Florida the public transportation is not that good, you actually need a car that drives  you to the bus station and then take the bus; a bus that will let you on a train station, that train station will offer you a ride of an hour to another bus that takes about half an hour to get to your job (if you live in Homestead and work in Miami). That is about three hours just arriving to your job, every day for five days in a row; that is about thirty hours a week, just to get to your job! But if you have a car, those three hours now are one hour, which seems reasonable (and it is still a lot!). If someone lives at Homestead and needs to do something (which is generally at downtown Miami or Doral) you would have to dedicate a whole day just doing it, if you are going in car because the distance between cities are ridiculous, can you imagine if not having it? For doing something you would have to take two days and do it by parts or wake up at the very morning when it is still dark so you can complete everything by the afternoon. So defenetly the car is a primary need.

Analyzing the life style that people at Vauban have, they are less stressed than the average person who owns a car; people starts to be more social with their neighbors because they have to walk everywhere and the faces are the same, so they actually get to know each other. They also got the benefit of a cleaner enviroment because they do not have the daily doses of smog that someone living in a city would have; cars cause the 12% of the contamination in Europe and more than a 50% in the United States. That is a problem that Paris maybe would not be facing right now if they had payed attention to contamination levels. Since World War II, science has been centered on developing new and better cars; can you imagine what would we have right now if some other would center the science in medicicne or something else?. In the United States an 80% of the budget goes to highways while just a 20% goes to public transportation. But, how can people in Bogotá or Vauben survive without cars? The distance between the comercial and suburban areas are close enough so a bus could take you there (just one bus). Defenetly, making the change would be hard due to our attachment to our cars, but little by little we can change or life style.",4,2,3,2,0,1,1,2,0
"Fail of the century ! The popular opinion in todays society is that sometime in the near future , driverless cars will be the norm. But driverless cars are destined to fail due to the fact that there is a large amount of people who love to drive and see driving more as a hobby than a chore . Also, the amount of money , time , and manpower needed to modify the roads to suit the needs of these driverless cars is completely ridiculous. Self driving cars will also prove to be quite the safety hazard and will bring troublesome disputes between drivers when something goes wrong.

Unless you suffer from terrible driving anxieties , driving can be one of the most stress relieving activities avaliable. Self-driving cars would take away the pleasure of cruising down the backroads without a care in world. Autonomous cars would take complete control of an immersive driving experience while the passenger would sit motionless, not knowing what to do . Cars give people the freedom to drive with no destination , a spontaneous roadtrip in other words, self driving cars can not ,assuming autonomous cars will be GPS based . you would have to set up a destination for every ride you take .

Our current highway systems are designed for cars with human drivers , if society were to all of a sudden switch to autonomous cars the backlash would be otherworldy. The United States Government would have to spend millions of dollars just to accomodate the needs of autonomous cars . Every existing bus stop or station would be promptly replaced by a self-driving taxi service . Depending on the design of these future vehicles, some if not all of the existing roads will have to be fitted with motion sensors and GPS monitoring systems.

If human drivers did not pose a giant threat to highway safety already just imagine the chaos if computers where driving. A small glitch or bug is all it woud take to cause a twelve vehicle accident that backs up traffic for three hours. Profesional hackers could also reak havoc among traffic from the comfort of thier own homes .The safest car will always be the one driven by the human.

To sum things up , Autonomous cars will not propser. The cost of revamping every road in existince is too ""expensive to be practical "". Also the amount of ways a self driving car can be explioted poses a serious threat to the safety of everyone on the road. If you love to drive , If you enjoy the freedom giving to you by General Motors, dont buy an autonomous car, stick with a six speed manual transmission!",3,3,0,3,0,1,1,1,1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. We learn from the passage that Venus has extremely hot temperatures, and also has an atomospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than we experience here on earth. Even though Venus is ""inhospitable"", many astronomers are still very much fascinated by Venus.

The author supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit to study by stating many beneficial features that Venus has. The author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" (Paragraph 4-lines 4 & 5) By inplying that Venus could have all these things, the author is telling us that Venus could also be used for things like what we use Earth for.

The author compares Venus to Earth for a reason. The author supports the idea of studying Venus being a worthy pursuit by stating that Venus has Earth like features such as; valleys, mountains, and craters. Since this planet has more Earth like features, than any other planet, astronomers are desperate to study more about the planet.

Since ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"", NASA is helping with the idea of studying Venus by coming up with ideas of how to send humans to Venus, to study the planet. The authors explains that, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" (Paragraph 5-lines 3 & 4) This help from NASA is very beneficial to the astronomers because NASA is proposing ideas of how to safely get to Venus, for astronomers to study.

Despite Venus having extremely hot temperatures and having a dangerous presure for humans to study on Venus' surface, NASA is helping astronomers propose ideas of how to safely study and get to Venus. The author supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit to study by comparing Venus' features to Earth and stating that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.",2,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2
"Many people thought that the Face on Mars was made by an ancient civilitation on mars. The Face on mars was not made by aliens. Instead it is a mesa or a natural landform. Due to new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft, We now know the Face on mars is accually a mesa.

Many people thought the image taken from the Viking spacecraft in 1976 was a face in the surface of mars made by an acient civilization. Although many people were fooled by the image many scientists were skeptical about the idea. Because of all the confusion, on April 5, 1998 Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the one that Viking had taken. The picture that was taken in 1998 revealed a natural land form. Not everyone was satified. On april 8, 2001, Malin's team decided to take another look at the Face on Mars. This time his team captured a photo of the landform using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. What the picutures showed was that the Face on Mars was a Martian equivilant to a mesa.

The Face on mars was mistaken for a hand made landform that was made by a Martian antcient civilization. Now we can see that it is nothing more than a natural landform.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"Hello, my name is Hannah. I am a scientist at NASA who has been studying the ""face"" on Mars over the years. Today my close friend Mason had asked me about any imformation I've found out recently. I said,""Well, it just appears to be a natural formation rather than something that was created."" He argued and argued over how the aliens built it,and how its just been hidden all these years.

In a shorter explaination I told Mason that the shadows show how they do on Earth on natural formations. He didn't quite get it so I showed him a messa and how they shadow. He still thought the marsians made the formation of the face.

The next day, he talked to me about the same thing. Only this time I knew that I could prove to him that the ""face"" was only natural. I pulled up the pictures taken over the years and let Mason examine them very carefully. The picture taken in 2001 shows that there is nothing else around the face. If there was anyhting on the ground such as an airplane or a shack, you have been able to tell what it was. But there was nothing. Mason still didn't agree that the form on Mars was a natural landform.

It was now the third day he has argued over the face on Mars. But this day, Mason didnt argue with me. He asked to see the pictures again, along with pictures of a messa and a butte, which are natural landforms here on Earth. Mason looked for hours and hours and hours. He finally spoke up,""Maybe you guys here at NASA are right.. It seems to be completely natural.."" I replied,""I told you old pal. Next time you should look into something more before you argue about it.""

The next morning Mason came to work with me. The other scientists and I all came agreed that the face on Mars was completely natural. Not only did NASA finally figure out how to ""unmask the face"" and call it a natural landform, but they also provided a lot of information that way people understood it better. To this day the ""face"" is known to be a natural landform!",2,4,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Besides being totally awesome, driverless cars could be extremely beneficial to the people in general. The many sensors on these vehicles help to to ensure the safety of the passengers as well as the human driver. People new to driving, elder drivers, and maybe even drivers udner influence would have an enormous amount of pressure allieved, therefore preventing the many deaths caused by vehicular accidents. Sensors like that of the modified Toyota prius; the rotating sensor dubbed "" LIDAR"", the position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, the GPS reciever, and other valuable equipment to secure the name of safety towards the vehicle. The death toll caused by reckless driving could be critically lowered because of the advancement and use of this technology. Now there is the argument of what if the tech fails, or if there is a special situation with the road. Heads up displays and other alerting software should be able to alert you if the vehicle needs human accompaniment to ensure that you still remain in control in these crucial incidents. That being said, it is still advised that the driver remain alert at all times while on the road, preventing the need of these alert systems being used heavily. The psycological changes this type of car can bring are unprecedented, because the people in general don't have access to these cars in the first place, because of safety concerns.

"Just imagine being able to go places without driving. If it was really possible to make driverlesscars, they would be a success. The development of these cars are already coming into a positive position. But also these cars do have some safety risks as well.

Driverless cars can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. What if you have a baby in the car, or perhaps a pregnant woman in labor? These features can help the driver get tasks done while in the car, and still be moving safely as well.

People may ask what if you get bored and fall asleep since your not driving? All models of driverless cars are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windsheild and other heads-up displays. Also GM has devoped driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object.

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedrstrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acheived with alert drivers. Traffic laws are written to the asumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. But new laws will be needed to cover liability in the case of an accident. If something fails and someone is injures, is it the diver or the manufacturers fault?

Driverless cars are coming into a positive postiton. They can break, steer, and accelerate themselves. That can help drivers at anytime when they are occupying the vehicle. All models are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

They're not as good as regular cars because they're not as safe, if you get in a reck the company might blame you for the accident and not the car, and finally the car would take the joy out of driving for people who love to drive.

The driveless car isnt as safe as a regular car. The driveless car runs on ""sensors"". As the text says, ""Without the option of smarter roads, maunfactures turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters, they needed a whole lot of sensors."" This is showing that the cars would need a lot more sensors which isn't safe at all. The sensors could malfunction and then when people go to drive, they put their lives in hands of these cars. They even say the car would have people take over sometimes, ""This means the hunan driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" People might start thinking they could do other things now that they wouldn't have to drive. They might read, text, watch videos, or maybe even just sleep. When the car needs the human to take over, the human might be distracted, and then they crash. The car wouldn't be safe. Not one bit

The companies value their proccess of their driveless cars and will pin the blame of the failure on someone else. If you got into a reck and the car was destroyed, who do you think they're going to blame? ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" They will, of course, blame the car for sure but most of the blame would pinned on the driver for not being ""too alerate"" or ""not focused enough"". People shouln't have to worry about that kind of law suit on their hands, but most likely they will.

Finallly, some people have a passion for cars, they love building them, driving them and, just everything about them. If people start selling drivless cars, instead of the normal cars, they wouldn't be doing what they love anymore. Their passion would be gone. ""The imformation from these sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on indivdual wheels and produce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" This is showing that the driver wouldn't have to do anything besides sit there and watch, how boring does that sound? People love to drive and for most cars is their passion, driveless cars would just take that right away.

In conculsion, making a driveless car would just be a bad idea because it wouldn't be as safe, if they reck, it'll be pinned on you, and it would be taking the fun out of driving away.",3,2,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Venus has been a planet neighboring the Earth and the Sun for many years. There has been many discoveries about the planet Venus and about other planets too. More discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and also other discoveries for Venus can be made.

Venus is called the Evening Star due to the fact that it is very bright when seen. Venus is the second planet in our solar system and it is almost as bright like the sun, when a stargazer looks up to the sky they can see our planet venus because it is easy to spot for a couple reasons. One beinging it is bright and the second it is close to our moon. The Moon and Venus can be considered twins, they are close in size, and it is close to our Earth but it is also close to the Moon. Venus is a warm planet not nearly as hot as the Sun but somewhere around there, so if huamns were sent up to space to live on Venus they wouldn't survive. There is no water in Venus it is just hot and lots of lava.

Over the years NASA has tried to send spacecraft up to Venus. They haven't been succesful due to the fact that it's so hot on Venus, every spacecraft ever sent has only lasted a couple hours. Not a single human has even been on Venus, they wouldn't want to risk someones life if a spacecraft cant survive than a human wouldn't be able to survive. Venus is truly a difficult planet for humans to study, not a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Planet venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit that is extremely hot, that is 90 times greater than what we experince on Earth. We would think that Mercury would be a hotter planet due to the fact that it is closer to the Sun but it turns out it's not.

Even though Venus is a hard planet to study scientist haven't given up yet. They are willing to do everything that is possible in order to find out more about it, scientist still want to visit the planet. Scientists say that Venus at one point was the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it probably had Oceans on it, Valleys and even mountains. Scientists are still developing new technology to send humans up into Venus so they can study it and find out more about the planet. They have even thought about designing something that allows astronauts to float on Venus so they dont have to be on Venus, that way they wont get burned.

In Conclusion, more discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and many more discoveries for Venus can be made. Many things are still being tested in order for us to find out more about our planet. Scientist aren't going to give up until they get some clear shots, there may be some difficulties during the process but it will totally be worth it. Nasa is working on other approaches to study Venus, some simplified eletronics have been made to make it easier to study Venus. These eletronics will be easy to use so scientist can make further discoveries but also study the planet without getting hurt.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear Mr. Senator,

There are many ways to go about elections of any kind, as you may know vey well seeing that you have been in one or more yourself. This country is about the will of the people supported by their government to excel and achieve the various goals they may very well have. Voting is one of those insintives people revieve, and how it is set up is an important part of that. We should keep relying on the Electoral College to succeed in keeping our country a democracy.

Having the Electoral College is a safe way to ensure that all people in every state get to voice their opinion while still keeping in mind the majority as a priority. As stated by author Richard A. Posner, people vote for a slate of electors, not the president, whom are entrusted to vote for the presidential candidate they represent. The number of electors is determined by the population of the state, which basically means the number of members in that state's House of Representatives and two for the Senate, as stated in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College? This ultimately would provide fair numbers for the overall count without making the smaller states feel insignificant.

Even with the smaller states being fairly included people argue that candidates do not pay attention to them and disreguard their overallvotes so we should switch to popular votes. These accusations may be true in a sense but what is to be expected if they dont account for as much or maybe they are already accounted for as ""decided"", as stated by Richard P. Would you campaign in a place like that? Especially since having elections be decided by popular votes could result in run-off elections to which no clear winner is evident, they would result in a tie, as included by Richard A. Posner. Having a tied election would end up giving the HOR overall election power, as presented in Source 1: What Is the Electoral College, so their arguement is not considerate of all possibly outcomes.

All in all, sticking with the Electoral College seems to be the best bet for our democratic country. Electors are trustworthy, with few faults, and the system is set up in a way that is fair to all. Keeping this system just making elections easy, fair, and helps to prevent ties and future headaches for all whom are involved",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,2,1
"""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" Is an article talking about venus it talks about how is difficlut exploring venus is and no one has been to venus in decades. On averge the tempature is over 800 degres Fahrenheit these conditions are far more extreme then what a human has encounter. they are comparing to a submarine

if it went down in the ocean the submarine would instantly be crushed by the metal and the pressure of the water. Venus is very fascinating, venus once may been like mostly earth plant long ago.

Venus was probably covered largely with oceans so this means that is can be various formed of life just like earth but Venus still has some features that are analogous to those like Earth. The planet has a texture almost as if its pure moutains,valles and craters this means that there can be life in Venus.

Venus forms a ship orbiting this means that it can provide only limted in sight on the ground beacuse most forms lights cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas or anything else from there. Therefore scientists are seeking to conduct there missin to undrestand more about venus and how its like in there. In conclusion venus does has a value the reson because of its value also beacuse the human curiosity will likely lead us into many equal oppertunites this can become a big inpact on us if we try to go to Venus and explore the plant are knowledge can be expanded to learn many things about Venus.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Would you like to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program? I think you would love to. You would be able to get to help people and save people, you would also get to travel the world and learn about different cultures. Even though you it might right now seem just like work, work and more work, you also get to have fun.

When your a Seagoing Cowboy you get to help people, and save them to. Maybe some of their houses got destroyed, or maybe then don't have enough supplies top trade care of themselves and their loved ones. Well being a Seagoing Cowboy you get to do this for people all around the world. You would definitely be able to meet new people and I think you would have a lot of fun. During 1945 many countries were left in ruins. Wouldn't you love to go help those people find food, find or build a shelter for them, and more? This would be an all around great experience.

In this experience of a life time you would also be able to travel around the world. Wouldn't traveling around the world seem fund? You be Abel to learn so much, like, maybe a new language, or some new facts that maybe you didn't know about that country. You would be able to learn about cultures and have a new experience. Being able to travel around the world would be amazing. Even through you are still doing work you would still get some free time too. It's now just work.

Even though you will be working most of the time, you can not just work, you have to have fun with it. Like you get to see animals and stay with them on the ship. Like when you have the shift to watch over the animals, you get to see them and check on them. Maybe even pet them. Ther could be all sorts of animals on the ships. Who's knows it a surprise. You also have the opertunity to see different places. When you get to your destination you get to explore or stay on the ship. You will be able to see like Greese, or China. Tidi would ave an awesome experience to me.

So now do you think that being apart of the Seagoing Cowboys would be fun? You would be able to help people across the country, you would be able to learn about different cultures, and would would get to have fun. This would be an experience that probably no one really has done. You could become a hero by justly helping people. I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

"There can be many reason why people had decided to stop using there cars and start doing more activities. First, cars waste money and gas and the gasonline burns and gases comes out and goes in the air. However, they pollution is destroying the air and leaving smog behind. Therefore, people should stop using there cars and think what should they do for the environment.

Using less motor vechicles are less important than the environment, the world we live in.

First, cars waste money and gas and the gasonline burns and gases comes out and goes in the air? We are wasting so much money on gasonline everyday and its ruining the air. Why because when the fuel burns, the gases comes out of the tanks and into the air and that's how we cause smog. We need air not chemicals to breathe and plants to help us breathe oxygen. We need sunlight so stay warm and have the plants and animals to eat and so we can stay health. What if you can you don't have to use the car for one month how would you feel about the air and the pollutionh without cars?

However, they pollution is destroying the air and leaving smog behind?

It's true that we are sometimes breathing in smog. It's disturbing that we have to breathe it in and out. We need to stop using cars and trying to figure out what we can do to protect the environment and the commiunty to help us. Many countries have smog and you can't be able to see the sun. Don't you want to end up like that place, and do want to be safe. Plus if we stop using cars and more into the environmentm we can connect to the people and other resources. Many people have a lot of stress when they are driving, what would you think if they got more connected to the world and having more social. They and even you can have a better life and having a good time socialing with others.

Therefore, people should stop using there cars and think what should they do for the environment.

Using less motor vechicles are less important than the environment, the world we live in. Many teenagers want to learn how to drive or wants to get there new car. But they don't notice other stuff going on in our world, they think they are more important than the world. But can you notice sometimes the most teens don't need cars like pther places because they don't need it and spend money on gas. Half the population had dropped of the percentage of teens driving. What can you do without cars and people who don't need it are better of having a life than people who spend on money on cars.

As a result, what can you do for the world without the cars and think about the air. Make a community without and motor vehicles and a better place for your have to live in. What would you have to do to stop using your cars and figure out a way to do transportation to a place you have to go. But had you know that in New York and France us there bikes to get to places. Because its a big place and not enough room to have cars to get to places. Plus its helps you stay fit and healthy. So think about the air and what can you do for the popluatin with people that have cars.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the story Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is one of the brightest points in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargaze to spot. The nickname was misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Often referred to as Earth's ''twin'' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. On the planet's surface,temperature average over 800 degress Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own plant. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Long ago Venus was maybe or probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Studying to meet the challange presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

"Do you ever feel like you should join a Seagoing Cowboys program? You should join the program because it helps the world, saves people and animals, and it good if you do join. That is why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and that you are helping many peoples lives and saving people to not run away and fight back.

First, it helps the world by in 1945 World War II, was being taken over by Europe and Europe made so many countries leave the ruins and it was just not right for people to move out of their countries. So 44 nations formed a group called the,"" UNRRA which meant (the United Nations Relief and Rehailitation Adminstration.) So I think it would help if more people joined and you could beat the Europe people who wanted to fight.

Then, save the people and animals by UNRRA had hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows, horses, and mules that had been shiped overseas. That is when Luke and Don had signed up. So after they had signed up in August 1945, they had got a orders to report to New Orleans. When Luke and Don arrived on August 14 Luke had said,"" The day the Pacific war ended."" Everyone got their seaman's papers and boarded that had SS Charles W. Wooster, headed to Greece with a cargo of horses and enough hay to eat So I think that if more people sign up more animals and people will be saved.

Last, good for you to join Seagoing Cowboys program its good by saving peoples lives and animals lives and by keeping the countries save so people can be happy if you join. And that if you join you can be rewarded will a big surprise in the end of the war that is going on. So now I think that you should always think before youself and join.

In conclusion, you should always join to be happy for what you did and joining would help the Seagoing Cowboys program. So for last try to do something new and it will really pay off if you try new things.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"From reading the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, it is a good idea to have driverless cars. They can really help with the world. It is a great idea to use these new cars because they use less fuel than today's cars, it allows betters response and control than a human, and if there is a problem the car can notify the driver.

Everyday humans use up a lot of gas. The gas that is being use harms the earth and makes it dirty. Using the Driverless car would help the enviorment more in terms of keeping it a clean place to live. In the article it states,"" The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" We can save more gas and the enviorment would be cleaner. Everyone wants to live in a clean and healthy enviorment so the driverless car would be a step in the right direction. It will also help with car accidents.

Another way that the smart cars would help out is by causing less accidents. There are far too many car accidents in the world from people who either cannot drive or they dont push the brakes in time. The driverless car controls that. In the article the authors says,""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine,allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" If the driverless car could respond faster than a person than we should have the driverless cars. It would cause less accidents and more people would survive. The driver would still be in control of the car though.

Lastly, another reason there should be driverless cars is beacuse even if some of the stuff cannot be done by the car, the person driving it can do something too. For example lets saythe driver is driving in a work or school zone and they have to slow down, they can do that without the car doing it. In the article it says,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills,such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.""

The driver would not have to let the car do all the work. In some cases the driver is going to have to do something and actually drive. The articles says that the car can run 90% on its own. Therefore the other 10% is the driver. The driver is going to have to stay alert and be ready when problems arise.

The driverless car is a fantastic idea and invention to have. The world needs more cars like them so that the world could be a better and more safe place to drive. Having a driverless car that can use less gas, have better response and control,and notify the driver in case of an emergency is a great car to have. The world could do a lot by having it.",3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"I think driverless cars are a good idea. There may be some deffects, but there are many more good things about it.

Having driverless cars would decrease car accidents. The article says ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Throughout the years technology will keep advancing, and driverless cars will only get better, and be safer. Passengers could text and have a much lower risk of crashing.

These driverless cars could help solve many problems. For example if someone is disabled, but still drives every once in a while this will help in many ways. It'll help by driving itself, while the disabled person can at least watch. If someone is late to work and they have to eat in the car, this would make it so much safer than eating and having one hand on the stearing wheel.

I think this would make older people's lives much more easy. One thing it can help with is taking them to the rite destination. It can also help them be more percatious of their surroundings.

Not only will this make things easier for many people, but it can also help people learn. In case of any accidents there will be cameras in the car and out that can show what exactly had happened. This driverless car can also help us appreciate the nature outside our car windows. Car accidents could be greatly reduced.",2,4,2,3,1,1,2,2,3
"The Electoral College is a process which is between a election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the popular vote of qualified citizens. Why do we need the Electoral College? We need the Electoral College to see what the people want in their opinion. Also, we need it for the problems the Electoral College avoids us from, such as each candidate doesn't recieve a majority of the votes cast.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, that wouldn't be fair. The people of the smaller states fell that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no sense of caring for their interests,like he really isn't their president. The bigger states, such as Texas, restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states lose. So, as we can see a larger state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaller state would.

Next, the Electoral College avoids us from things in many ways. For example, Nixon in 68' and Clinton in 92' both had a 43 percent chance plurality of popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. Which means that pressure, which would greatly confuse the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which clearly states the winner. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president could turn off potential voters that has no hope for carrying their state. So the Electoral College greatly avoids run-off elections.

Therefore, we shall keep the Electoral College in favor for why we need to have it, and how it helps us avoid big situations. So please, let us keep the Electoral College as it helps our country throough political situations and for how it helps us.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear State Senator,

Everyone has their very own opinions on whether or not the Electoral College should be abolished. Well, with evidence from past elections, it is pretty clear that the Electoral College rule should be abandoned. Let alone is the Electoral College unfair in many ways, but also, it is unneeded.

First and foremost, the Electoral College should left in the wind because it is unfair. Our society and todays people have different opinions and different standards in life, then the people in 1776. For example, in those times, the states we have now were not all how they were then: 1. there was a much smaller population, 2. not all the states we have now were America's states then, and 3. peoples beliefs were different. In ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" states ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Pgph. 10) This is saying that the citizens votes are not being counted for, voting directly to the presidential election, but to the states Electoral College. Obviously, the people want their votes to mean something, and not to just let the others vote for them. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt even see the candidates at all,"" This clearly shows that getting rid of the Electoral College would be best.

Secondly, the Electoral College is unneeded for voting. The citizens cast a vote in the poll, so that the president they want will when. So, how does having an Electoral College make the peoples votes needed. Let alone, the citizens make their own decisions. If this country is a democracy, it means the people are apart of the choices of the government to, but with the Electoral College, the state casts in only a small vote from each state. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" (Pgph. 12) The Electoral College is simply unneed.

Lastly, everyone has their own opinions on whether or not we should get rid of the electoral college. It is very simple, the Electoral College should be demolished, due to being unfair, and unneeded.",3,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0

"In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.

Venus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

So why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.

"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus,5)

that statement from the excerpt states that scientists have come up with their theorys to explore Venus. They have an idea to send Humans above Venus's atmosphere to explore Venus so they do not melt by the extremely high tempertures or get crushed by the high pressure. With these ideas humans could explore Venus without being harmed and could gather needed information about the twin planet. Scientists are also working on other approaches to studying Venus with possible electronic devices that could last possibly up to three weeks on Venus's surface. With more time scientists could create more ideas and plans to explore Venus's surface.

In this prompt I have explained the twin planet, Venus, and the dangers it holds. The author of the excerpt, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I have also explained the dangers Venus posses such as the high tempertures and the extremely high pressure. Scientists are creating more and more theorys of ways to explore

Venus everyday. Therefore in the future I do belive we will explore Venus and that exploring Venus would be very plentiful to the humans race.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1

Then the inventor would be fined with all the damages and homocides his cars have done because he decided to be driverlesss.

This technology is valuable especially valuable to the students, do to the fact it can help improve classes, your everyday way of liiving and finally help with the health of school teens or just humankind in general.

This technology is valuable especially to students since it can better your everyday classes. Since this technology is capable of reading your every emotion it would be able to sense when you might be totally struggling in a class or it would also be able to let you know what your best subjects are. Since this technology is based off of a computerlized system it would be able to be installed in all classes. With technology like this in the classroom it would help students with career goals, or just set them up for the future ahead of time. Sometimes it can really be challenging for a student to know or not if they will do well in a class or not. But that problem would be solved when the emotion reader is used. With the help of that technology it could help a whole school system.

This technology would be a great help to school system by letting teachers know when a students having a bit of a rough day, when shown to counselors, they would be best for the future of a student or parent. This technology is something that would be wanted by any and everyone.

But finally the technology used to read facial emotions, is valuable to the students because it helps determine career pathways or future plans, helps layout a visible coarse set determined by a counselor and student and lastly is the best new and advanced way to prevent teen health.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"I argue in favor of changing the Electoral College, to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should be allowed to vote ,on the person they want them to run the Presidency. Instead of only having 34 Democratic as the a state's voters. That way the President gets the votes that he or she desevers. They should jsut let anyone choose who the want ,having the states with diffferent opinons.

In my opinon,I think that all states representatives should have the same amount of people in the house of representatives. I don't find it fair that some states have 500,000 voters and others 35 million voters. In that case just let one state vote on who should be the next president. Let everyone vote on who they want, on whom they feel like it's the right person. Not everyopne thinks the same , not everyone believes in the same things as everyone else. Butwith the Electoral College they are not ,let the people vote on what they want in most states, for an example Texas. In Texas they only have 34 voters taht will vote on the person they were sent to vote on. Sometimes the voter would get confused and vote on the opisite person or they would just vote on who they wanted to vote on in the fisrt place.",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Face is just another natural landform that any other planet would have. NASA sent out the Viking 1 in order to look for a landing spot for the Viking 2 on the planet Cydonia. When taking pictures of possible landing spots for the Viking 2, it picked up a shadowy figure that resembled a human head. But, scientists just figured it was another Martian Mesa which was common on Cydonia.

There is no life on Mars because the Face is actully just a Mesa. Mesas can be found on earth also, for example in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is the Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is quite equivalent to the Face on Mars. The formation of the mesa has caused shadows to make it resemble a human face. These mesas are common on Cydonia.

Conspiracy theorists believed that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is life on Mars. The reality is that NASA would in fact benefit from currently, or once having life on Mars. There was no actual alien monument which was later discovered after having the pictures enhanced, when enhanced there would have been other alien monuments around it. The pictures taken only showed that it was just a Martian mesa. Not a monument created by aliens, but a mesa that is found on any other planet. Thus, further backing the fact there is no alien life on mars.",2,3,2,3,2,2,2,2,3
"At the time I was working two jobs as a grocier and a banker.Then people were asking if I could join the seagoing cowboys. So i said yes,then I asked my friend don.

When don and I started on the ship with all the animals we felt wierd that we were just two small town boys doing this giant trip. Once we saw land I had just turned 18 before that.

When Don and I hit land with all the animals we had to take them to all the villages and towns for all the people. We had to go back to the U.S. and get more and bring them to the other places like China, Venice italy. Venice was the most exiting place. It had streets that are full of water and the houses are on stilts, and people were very nice.

Everything was beutiful and Don and i wish we had the opportunity to go again, maybe when were on one of are military trips.",1,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Have you ever wondered if the face on Mars was actually real?

Many people think it is real and some don't.

A Viking 1 photo of this mysterious face on Mars shows a picture of a face on this red planet.

It seems real but it is actually shadows from a huge rock formation.

These shadows give you illusions of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

Some people might think the face on Mars is real but it isn't.

It is a natural landform that has a shadow revealing a human face.

NASA revealed an image showing a ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head that was formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" The picture of the face on Mars plays tricks on your mind because you think it is real when it really isn't.

It is an illusion that makes you believe it is a face when it is only a natural landform.

On April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured some pictures of this mysterious face on a cloudless summer day.

Since no clouds were around when the crew took pictures, sure enough the face was just a landform.

Usually this landform would cast a shadow resembling a face but no clouds were in the area for this to happen.

Thousands of web surfers wanted to know if the face was real or not and then the ""image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform."" The face on Mars was thought to be real but these pictures provided enough evidence that the face was a natural landform.

At first, many people thought the face on Mars was real because it was in films, magazines, and radio talk shows.

This huge sensation about the face on Mars was shortlived because scientists soon figured out that it was just a landform.

When you see the picture of the face, it looks real because of the shadow reflected off of the landform.

It is only an illusion that is tempting to believe.

This is why I believe the face is a natural landform.",2,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,3
"Man, I enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. I got to help so many people! You should sign up! The purpose of Seagoing Cowboys was to help countries that have suffered from WW2, such as Greece and China. It was created by UNRRA, and was very helpful to all critical European countries.

A few reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is because we bring horses, cows, and muless to countries in need and we also take care of these animals. You also have some time for sightseeing. However, there is some danger of signing up. Seeing as you´re on a boat most of the time with hundreds of animals, you have limited space, and then you have the dangers of the sea. When I say dangers of the sea I mean things like drowning, storms, et cetera.

Now, I want to tell you about how I got into Seagoing Cowboys, and my story of being one. It was 1945. I had two part-time jobs at the time, and my friend Don Reist asked me if I wanted to join him in going to Europe on a cattle boat. World War 2 had just finished, and lots of European countries were in a critical state. 44 nations joined to make the UNRRA, and they hired people to take care of cattle that were being shipped. Don and I both signed up.

In August, we were told to go to New Orleans for our job. We boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, a cattle boat with more than 300 horses. I was discharged in 1947, and I had made history. I made 9 trips, which is the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. It was impressive, seeing as I couldn´t work for a few days due to broken ribs. I was so proud of myself, and it was definitely more than a job, it was a way to help me be more aware of others´ needs.

Well, I have to go back to my job at the supermarket. I recently was rehired and got my position back in the meat department. Now, isn that ironic? Remember, if you have the chance to be a Seagoing Cowboy, take it! It´ll open up so many parts of the world to you.",2,4,3,4,3,3,3,2,4
"Do I believe that using technology to read students expressions valuable? Well their are pros and cons to this technology.

The way that technology is able to do this in the first place is beacuse of Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman. They created a machine that tracks the movement of your muscles. Such as a sign of anger is your orbicularis oris which is around you mouth when it tightens that is a sign of anger. Also when above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you are suprised. Each face is compared to a face with no face expression to compare and find the signs to identify the expression.The computer could also adjust the lesson for you so you are not bored. A regular PC coudnt handle such confusing algorithms but they can write down sample instructions to encode your emotions.

The cons of The MOna Lisa, is that alot of times people dont want others to know their feelings. They would rather keep it to them selves. Using The Mona Lisa could be breaking their privacy.

All of around I would say that The Mona Lisa is valuable. Its such a good thing to have around for the most part. Being able to adjust a lesson to the way someone feels can help students to be more interested and better learners. Also knowing the way a student feels can prevent and solve a lot of problems. Lots of prombles in school could be prevented if a teacher knew ahaead of time of the problem or how another student really felt about a problem So yes once again The Mona Lisa is valuable.",1,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"This story is about a new technology that is called a Facial Action coding system that are able able to recognize other people faces. I'm explaining what I think about people using a facial recognition. This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans. These people can actually use it for there iphones now. For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device.

The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology. I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea. Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression. That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that. I some time ask myself how do they do that.

I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing. I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is. I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then. I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future. Their already trying to make self-driving cars.

This story is amazing. I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me. This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about. When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me. I would consider only using something simple.

This story told me alot. It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing. I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology. That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day. If I would use it I would be careful with it.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Venus often reffered to as the Earth's twin is a close panet like Earth. It has about the same density and and size of Earth too. So Venus should be a worthy pursuit to explore.

If anything ever happens to Earth the closest planets to explore and possibly populate are Mars and Venus. But there are some dangers to exploring these planets. For example on Venus a single rover has only lasted a couple of hours on the planet. So we dont know much about the planet. But that does not mean we cant explore and gain new information about the planet that mey help us out in the future. But the reason scientist and astronomers are looking more into the planet is because in paragraph 4. It states that Venus was probally a planet like Earth that had oceans and could have supported life. Another plus to explore Venus is the chance to figure out what happened to the planet. In the articel it says it used to be just like Earth in a way. So our natural assumption is to asume that our planet will end up just like Venus. But if we take some time and continue exploring the planet we might find some new information and could possiblly save all of humanity in the future.

In conclusion the option to explore Venus still remains untuched but the positives and possibilities that could come out of this exploration are vast compared to the dangers it represents.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Will Nasa make the hover ship work? Will we get to discover more about venus? Is this all really worth this? Will they all make it out alive?

In the text the author states vebus is called a ""Evening star"" which is one of the brightest points of lights in the night sky, wmaking it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. The text also states Venus is second planet from our sun. Which means venus is simple to see from the distant ,but safe vantage point of earth, it proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is earth ""twin"" venus is the close planet to earth in terms of density and size. The author also states humans sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world. None of the single spaceship had survived. The spaceship would never last more than a hour on venus. This is why venus is a challengin planet for humans to study and find more about

The text states Venus is coverd with a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. In the text is also says even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. This planets is dangrous this is why most thing can't touch this planet. The text says these condition are extreme. This planet is hard to get on,but this won't stop them for trying to find a away to get on this planet. This might take years to find a away.

Im sure they will come up with many ideas or maybe have to find a way to get on this planet. it will be a challenge for them, but nothing will stop them from trying.

In the text Venus is called our sister planet ,but is so inhospitable secientisit still try to get on this planet. The athuor also states astroonomers are fascinated by venus because it may ha ve been the most earth like planet in our solar system. It also states

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary vist. This planet may be dangrous. but that doesn't mean they will give up just because they may have failed in the past. The text states Nasa has one particularly complling idea for sending humans to study venus. In the text they are going to try and make a hovering car so they wouldn't have to touch the group and the people inside will be safe . They are also look for more way to make it to Venus.

"In the article 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus' the author mentions mutiple challenges of exploring the planet. Despite this, the author seems to support the further exploration of Venus. Later in the article, the author explains their reasoning. This essay will first analyize the author's statements at the beginning of the article.

In the first paragraph of the article, the author explains that there are many different challenges that have prevented humans from sending a probe to explore Venus' surface. Later, in paragraph three, the author gives examples of said challenges. These include clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid, average temperatures of 800 degrees, incedibly high atmospheric pressure, and a heavy carbon atmosphere. (paragraph 3) These conditions on Venus have prevented humans from exploring the surface because a probe that is able to withstand this harsh enviornemnt does not exist. After the author expalins why Venus has not been explored, they then present a few ideas that could lead to a new innovation.

In paragraph five, the author informs readers of an idea that NASA has come up with to explore Venus. The author describes this invention as a blimp-like vehicle that will hover above the planet's harsh surface. They reason that being able to explore Venus without having to touch the surface is possible due to thr more surviveable conditions of the atmosphere. The author reassures readers that traveling to Venus may be possible by explaining how technology could be invented to allow humans to survive the harsh enviornment. Towards the end of the article, the author also gives another possible breakthrough for these challenges.

In paragraph seven, the author describes another disocvery from NASA. The innovation that is mentioned, silicon carbide, may have the potential to survive in the harsh conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author gives other possible ideas such as using more durable older computers that may be able to survive on Venus longer than modern technology. This shows that the author believes that the answer to exploring Venus may be closer than originally thought.

The author of this article shows readers that they support the idea of traveling to Venus despite the current challenges. Throughout the article, the author provides many ideas that could possibly allow future probes to visit the planet's surface. Also, in paragraph eight the author desribes how they personally feel that dangers and doubts about traveling to Venus should not limit humans from exploring it. The Author cleary shows through this statement that they are positive that NASA will find a way to explore Venus.",3,2,3,3,1,1,2,1,2
"Throughout the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of suporting the claim that studying Venus is worth while. The author provides examples and counters them with ways to overcome said obstacles, and uses specific examples on how NASA plans to study and explore Venus.

Venus has many different aspects and characteristics from Earth, such as the temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Geological and weather challenges include lightning strikes, erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes. The author mentions all of the issues regarding visiting Venus in the second and third paragraph. Although the author mentions the challenges, he/she is doing that to completely inform the reader by giving all the details and then finding ways to counter those obstacles. The author brings up the question of ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" in the beginning of paragraph 4. This shows how the author brings up an argument against the initial claim, and then proving that argument wrong to make the claim more valid. Next, in the fifth paragraph, the author uses evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to provide ways to escape the hostile conditions of Venus. For example, one idea is to allow scientists to float above the fray in a blimp like vehicle. Again in the second paragraph, the author again mentions another plan by NASA to study Venus. This plan is to use simplified electronics made of silicon carbide because they could survive Venus's surface for a limited amount of time. By using specific evidence and research already done by NASA, the claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" is being proven well. Lastly, in the final paragraph, the author does an excellent job of summarizing the scientific gains that would come from exploring Venus. The last line states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which is a fantastic summary of the article and shows how well the author presented and supported his claim.

In conclusion, the author uses excellent writing skills to support and validate the initial claim, and does it very well. The author thoroughly analyzes each danger and possible solution, and also states the positive effects of traveling to Venus. By using specific evidence and research from NASA, and countering all of the dangers with possible solutions, the author supports the claim brilliantly.",4,4,4,4,2,3,3,4,3
Studing Venus is a good idea because they is so much people have to learn about it and peope dont. You could learn and knoe so much about Venus. Its a good idea he has so much on it and it good be good stuff that no one knows about. Its is known as earths twin. They have sent many space craft all of them have only lasted a hour or so. Thats why they havent send a lot of people up there to stay. It has the hotest tempeter of any planet. They have talked about more visites to Venus. It formiler futers as earth. They want to send people to Venus to study it. THey want to have a car that well be able to just say off the ground so they can go there. They cant take samples or rock or gas that far away from it they wouyld have to be up close. They are working on other wys to be able to go up there and learn more about it. It has went up on how many people want to go up there and explore. I think the arthor suported the idea well. I think that in the next cople of years people well be able to go there an resurch and get the stuff they want from there. Like studing the rock and whatever ese they have up there. He made a lot of good statments about how we wouldnt be able to get thst close because the remputer is so hot. Even if you whernt thst close it would still be 170 degrees and that is still really hpot and can hurt someone. they would have to figure out a outfit or suit that can make it do its not so hot so they can go up there and resurch. They would have to make a rocket that could float because it the rocket touched Venus it would melt and they would die up there. But over all i think the aother made good statments about it and what would have to hapen to go up there.,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The technology shows positives for human emotions. The Technology mesaures muscle movement, emotion, and how different emotions can be mixed with other emotions. Technology is changing the future to be exactly like a Human and be able to read a Human.

This Technology reads the Human body and muscle movements. the process happens when the Computer constructs a 3-d computer model of the Face and musle movements. The artical says this in paragrapgh 3 lines 2-3 ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like Human musles. The technology can sense six basic types of emotion. The technology will associate each movement of the muscles with the emotion that would match that certain muscle movement.

emotion is a big part of the human body and so are facial expressions. ""Dr. Paul Eckman""and ""Dr. Huang"" have created a technology to read these emotions. These technology can read emotion from even people that show very low degree of emotion. The mona lisa created by Da Vinci was created to show human emotion. But the mona lisa isnt just happy because she is smiling. The mona lisa shows a whole bunch of emotions and this is saying is that any human can seem like they are happy or sad but really they can be the exact opposite.

Now the Doctors say that these techniology can read emotion but if we make a emotion does it really mean we have that emotion. The docotrs say that if you make a emotion it can even produce a real one. i think these technology would help todays society becuase it would help with seeing what other friends and family feel.

This technology can be very useful and i would like to see it used a lot. This technology tracks emotion,muscle movement, and change in emotion. emotion is a big part of life and the way people do there everyday life. In today's society emotion is a major difference to the way people act to one anither.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we head into the future many new inventions and ideas are being created to better human life. One of these inventions is a driverless car. As crazy and far-fetched as it may seem, computercontrolled cars ,may soon be taking over. Driverless cars may be one of the greatest inventionsin recent Years.

The driverless car could solve so many problems that we all encounter daily on the road. For example, driverless cars can solve the issue of speeding. Since there is a computer controlling the car it will always drive the speed limit, saving people money and lives. Also, a computer will never get tired so there is no worrries of falling asleep at the wheel which can also help prevent many late-night accidents. Lastly, driverless cars can help prevent the growing epidemic of texting and driving, as will as drunk driving.

With driverless cars taking over the road, this can help keep everyone safe on the road and prevent thousands of accidents. With a computer controlling the car that knows everything there is to know about driving safely, this can help insure one's safety while traveling via car. Of course there will be situaions that a human driver is more skilled than the computer, such as when there is heavy traffic and/or weather conditions. With time and a better understanding, the driverless cars will learn to adapt to these situations.

Though it may take some time for everyone to adapt to the change of being a full time passenger in the car, while a computer drives, it will all work out for the better. In the long run these cars will help protect people all over and make the roads a much safer place. Love driverless cars or hate them we are heading towards them and they are here to stay.",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3
"Many people may argue about the advantages of limited car usage. ""When i had a car, i was always tense, im much happier this way"" (Source 1). Many countries including France, Colombia, and Germany seem to have no problem with limited car usuage.

Germany is one of the greatest countries that is against low car life. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars. 57 percent sold a car to move Germany. (Source 1). In total their is approximatly 5,500 residents and has a low car life because their are less space for parking.

One of the most populated city in France is Paris. Paris enforced a driving ban to clear up the polution. A 22-euro fine was given if one failed to corespond with the rules. Around 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine . After 5 days of almost car free roads (not including bus and taxis) the traffic went down by 60 percent.(Source 2). The biggest problem of the smog was Diesel fuel. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France compared to the rest of Western Europe that has 53.3 percent average on Diesel.

For 3 straight years, Bogota has been doing ""Day Without Cars"" that limites transportation only allowing buses and taxis. the goal for this day is to reduce smog in the capital city. Violators who failed to corespond was faced with a $25 fines. "" Millons of colombians hiked,biked,skated, or took the buses to work during this car-free day"" (Source 3). The whole family went to parks and sports centers to occupy their day. Even two others Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined in on this event.

What both countries are trying to do is limited cars so less polution. Their are other transportation besides cars that we can use.",1,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Limiting car usage can put a new perspective in your life. Limiting car usage can be a huge benefit because first of all, you'll have better health. This even goes out to the healthiest people in this world. Secondly, Global Warming will be less harsh and dangerous to all the living creeatures of the world. Lastly, you can be more open and associate with many people. Limiting car usage is probably the best idea to reduce all the hazards and bad things on Earth.

To begin with, I want to inform you that car usage has become worse and worse over the years. Our health is in jeopardy because of how much we use cars. But with limiting car usage around the globe anyone can become a healthier person. A great percent of our population in th United States are overweight or obese. Even all over the globe! With limiting how much time we use cars we can reduce that percent and become healthier people because that way we can walk to our places and not just sit down in a car doing absolutely nothing. People have become much happier in limmiting their car usage. Those people go out and get fresh air and not sit in a car going from place to place. And with being much happier has come less stress. People who are too stressed are not to happy that's why its better not using a car just to go grocery shopping. You wouldn't have to worry about the lights and stop signs or be scared if your going to be in a car accident. The only time you should be able to use a car is going long distances and places like other cities.

To move foward, Global Warming has become a really big issue for us. All the pollution that Planet Earth gets from cars is absurd! Cars release so much gas and harmful substances that we breathe in. It doesnt only affect us but animal too and all living things. Now the smog has gotten way worse. Paris has a huge percent of smog covering the city that even France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Congestion has gone down to 60 percent. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted city in the world. Now everywhere you go even if its really cold nights arent as cold as they used to be. Cold nights and warm days have caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Another thing about limiting car usage is that you can even associate with other people around you. Just walking to you local market or a food restaurant you are probably say hello to different people some even communicating with them. You can walk to parks or go walk to a nearest pool or beach and I gaurantee you that you're going to be talking to many different people throughtout the day. You can use alternative transportation such as bus, bikes, scooters and let me tell you being in bikes and scooters is a lot more fun a relaxing then driving a car or being in one. Walking and hiking around is a huge relieve of stress.

Hence, limiting car usage is a big improvement for us it will help us in so many ways. Such as, we can improve our health and we could be so much better because a great percent of this world is either overweight or obese and limiting cars can help you go out and walk or even bikes can get you where you want to go and thats a form of exercise. Global Warming has been on the rise. It's been rising and rising and limiting how much we use cars can absolutley help with it by lowering the pollution the temperatures may not be so hot you wont feel like your boiling just walking outside your front door. You can associate with many different people throughout your day even if it's just a simple hello.

"Based on the passage, I can infer that the author studied a lot about Venus. He states that Venus is close to earth but close to the sun also. Which creates the problem that no human being can land on Venus because of its heat and density. Also in the passage, the author states how it's been three decades and we still, despite the technology we have, can't land on Venus. Not even the machine they sent out could survive. Problems like that make NASA more curious, which makes it more worthy of a pursuit.

The author stated that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. Venus has a roughly 97 percent thick carbon dioxide atmosphere according to the author. Astronomers believe that Venus may have been a Earth-like planet long ago. The author says that Venus still has features that are similar to Earth features. Nasa has been working on a way to get humans to venus while making sure they survive and make it back. According to the author in paragraph 5, Nasa is trying to make a hovering vehicle for the humans to float in. It will have the capability to float 30 miles in the air. The only problem is that the astronaut wouldn't be able to get an in depth look at all the features because of the height.

The author states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. That can lead to a breakthrough idea to get a human to Venus. No ideas have worked yet but they're constantly working and testing out new ideas. The author talks about how human curiosity will lead to lots of intimidating endeavors and also lots of dangers. That alone proves how well the author supported the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1,3,3,3,2,3,3,3,3
"Many people might think that the face on Mars was created by aliens and many others might think that it is just a natural landform.

There is no proof for any of the rumors.

People have had clues about them.

Some say that it looks like an Egypitan Pharaoph, others say it looks like a river from Idaho.

The face has become so popular that it was starred in movies, magazines, books and talk shows.

It was so popular because it was unusual.

NASA knew once they showed the public the picture they would attract more attention to the planet Mars.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia and took a picture that came out more clear than the first picture that NASA took.

To get the picture was hard work.

They usually do not pass over Cydonia very often.

There is a spacecraft that will fly over the location and scan it like a fax machine.

The picture of the face may mean different things to people and some may have different opinions about it.

One person said it looked like a mesa formed by lava.

If NASA done more research about the face in Cydonia they might be able to figure out what it is and what caused it.

Unitl someone says what it really is, it will just be a big mystery.

You can spot the head shaped figure from two miles away.

Photographing the landform became important to NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor.

They also felt that it was important for taxpayers.

No matter how cloudy or hard it was to see and capture the face, they still made it work.

The crew in the Mars Global Surveyor said there were alien markings that were hidden.

When Malin's team tried again to find another photo they went on a cloudless day and used the maximum resolution and got another picture.

When they used the maximum resolution you could see things that were even on the ground such as planes or pyramids.

They also stated that the landform was almost the same as a butte.

The landorms were common around the American West.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0
"Driverless cars is a cool invention. Everyone wishes they can have a driverless car. The cars could be very dangerous also. Drivers still have to be aware because you never know what can happen. The cars are also dangerous because it is not truly driverless, it may not alert you sometimes, and and can cause you accidents in a constrution area.

Driverless cars aren't truly driveless. They can cause bad accidents because of that. The driver should always stay alerted while in the car because anything can happen. In the text it informs us that ""Google driverless cars have driven more than a half a million miles without a crash."" I'm sure the drivers were still alerted so they wouldn't crash.

The driverless may not alert you sometimes. You never know when something can go wrong with the car that can mess up the alert system. In the text it say ""they can steer, accelerate , and brakes themselves,"" that can be a bad thing because if the car had a problem it could use one of those in the wrong situation like accelerating in a workzone area or braking on the expressway.

It can also cause you to have accidents in a constrution work area. Driverless cars aren't perfect so it can mess up at anytime. It basically have a mind of it own so you should always be alert. You can easily have an accident because you'll be fascinated by the driverless car that you wouldn't be alerted. in the text it says"" it has complicated traffic issues such as navagating through roadwork or accidents.

Driverless cars aren't truly safe. You should always be alerted because you'll never know what'll happen. It can cause serious accidents and you can get seriously injured, not just you other people too. It has a mind of its own and human drivers shouldn't a hundred percent trust a driverless car.",2,3,1,2,0,1,0,1,0
"Am I for or against the development of driverless cars? I am completely for the development of driverless cars. I am for the driverless cars because it would help a lot with accidents involving texting and driving, with drunk driving, and with falling asleep while driving. Am I for or against the development of driverless cars?

I am for driverless cars because it would help a lot with accidents involving texting and driving. Texting and driving wouldn't be as much of a problem if the driver is not actually driving the car themselves. Being distracted from the road and texting people wouldn't cause an accident if a car was driving itself. In the article it mentions things about the cars that they test drive inproving in great amounts over the years. In paragraph 5 it says, 'Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers.' The cars become smarter and more advanced as there years go on, just like technology. Am I for or against the development of driverless cars?

Drunk driving wouldn't be as much as an issue with these cars. A lot of the time when someone goes out and gets drunk they have to have a chaperone who won't drink to drive them home. Sometimes they can't find one, and live too far to walk so they just make the decision to drive themselves home, which is never ever smart. If they make that decision then car wrecks can happen and people can get majorly hurt, even killed. But this car can be like the chaperone; cars obviously can't get drunk. You can trust this car to safely take you home. Am I for or against the development of driverless cars?

Another issue that would kind of be solved with these cars is falling asleep while you're driving. Falling asleep while driving is very dangerous, and can hurt so many people. Everytime that my dad is driving at night, I am always on high alert watching him and making sure he doesn't fall asleep, because it's happened before. Luckily, no one got hurt but we so easily could have been. With driverless cars, this wouldn't be a problem. If you fall asleep behind the wheel, big deal; you are not driving the car. In the passage it does say that some cars alert you when there is a problem that the car can't handle, but the car can always wake you up. And it's a lot safer than falling asleep in anormal car and driving off the road or hitting someone else because you, nor anybody else, has control over the car. Am I for or against the development of driverless cars?

Am I for or against the development of driverless cars? I am completely for it. I am for the driverless cars because it would help a lot with accidents involving texting and driving, drunk driving, and with falling asleep while driving. Are you for or against the development of driverless cars?",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Do you really need a computer to express your emotions? Updates in technology have found ways for a computer to track facial movements to detect human emotion. This allows computers to detect your emotions before you do. We are told to answer if this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that this techonlogy is not valuable in a classroom.

My first reason for thinking its not valuable is because it doesn't provide any benefits to the classroom. Why does our expression or emotion need to be known by the teacher or computer? Education doesn't have to be amusing or easy. Thats the point of learning. Emotion isn't taken in to consideration when we are assigned homework.

Secondly, my reason for disagreeing with the valuability of this technology in a classroom is because looks are decieving. Let's say for example a stuent is doing perfectly well on their assessment and sees how much time has gone by. They are confused, but only for a second. This is sent to the instructor as a message of confusion on the topic. This has caused an unnessisary interuption on the assesment. Computers can't detect every emotion, and they surely can't detect where the cause of that emotion is coming from.

In contrast to my argument, one could say that for a computer, being able to tell emotions gives us an davantage. For example ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" as quoted in paragraph 6. I would argue that if a student is becoming confused then they should ask questions. Also, it is natural to not take interest in the lesson. Boredom is commom in school, but that should not impact the ability to learn.

In conclusion, the technology provides no real benefits to a classroom, neither to a student. Bringing this technology to a classroom would be a waste of time. Emotions are decieving in school and don't have to be acknowledged by a computer. This is why I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.",3,4,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"I'm going to write about

why The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it present. form the passage called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,""

The author suggest that because in the passage there are very different and interesting things about ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" First because in paragraph 2 it say that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and it say that ocassionally the closest in distance too. Second because the person that is suggesting to read the passage is the author and if he is suggesting that is because the passage is very interestig like These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.and that will be very interesting to people to read and know more about venus and explore reand passages, articles, everything that has to be with Venus. Also it say that In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun. while venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Also NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, For example, come simplied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface. It show that the the passage must be reader by many people bacuse the author give the best from him and because he do a very interesting passage so the raders can learn alot from Venus.

Second because in page 3 it say that ""Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system, even through Mercury is closer to sun"". The people would be very interesting in know that how can that be possible that venus has the hottest temperature even that mercury is the more closer to the sun. Also because it say that "" Venusian geology and weather represent additional impediments like eruption volvanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" The author is saying that so the readers can notice that venus have very different and powerful things. Also in page 4 it say that ' Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. People would shock by reding this and the author will see that he was correct in suggesting

in studying Venus.

Finally because the all passage has demostrate that is very interesting to read, In page 8 it say that Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value. not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. this part also say that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

In conclusion l think that many people should read the pasasage because it has very intersting things and because they can learn more about Venus, Students can learn more

about Venus and other planet from this pasage and learn how they work and this can help them in school in class some classes like biology or maybe history. I think they have to read it and studying like the author say it that what I will suggest too if I write a pasage like this or other if other person write a passage like this very interesting and very professional.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The electoral college, a mistake?  Many Americans are unsatisfied with the electoral college and the system it follows.  The electoral college has disapointed millions of Americans of any social class.  According to

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , by Bradford Plummer, "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors, who in turn elect the president.""  America should abolish the electoral college as it has upset 60 percent of americans and elected unwanted Presidents.

""This year voters can expect another close election in which the polular vote winner could lose the presidency"", as said by Bradford Plummer.  Every year Americans fall stricken by dissapointment from the electoral college.  The system of the electoral college is a poor representation of american ideals as canidates do not even bother spending time in non-swing states. According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the canidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad.  As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.

The electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winner-takes-all system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense.  Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashaimed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.

When the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people.  In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated.  The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling  the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and dissapointment.  The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.

In conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state.  This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed.  Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"New cars, that can control themselves ,are being manufactured in the United states. The driverless cars have censors that can tell the vehicle when to move forward or stop moving . In the passage it says ""Google has had cars that could drive independently since 2009"" and the cars are still being worked on to this day. A human must still be presant so they can take over and drive if the car needs to park or is having trouble in traffic. This new driverless car is still rather new and I think it puts people in danger.

Imagine if this self moving car has a mess up or is a little damaged and it goes out of control. The human inside the car might not be paying enough attention to realize the car needs help. I believe that if you were to allow people to have a self driving car they would eventually lose the feeling of responsibility . Although the car is able to drive to certain places, due to its computer programming, people might over look that they still must be focased and ready to drive.

The new cars will notify you if it needs you to take over. This is helpful but still a large risk . Censors do have the ability to mess up and cause crashes. I dont see why they are trusted. In the article ""driverless cars are coming"" it states ""if technology fails and somone is injured , who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer."" this only adds to my point of lack of saftey. How is one sipposed to know if it was their fault or the manufacturers .

I think it is not safe to have cars attempt to control themselves . There are so many times when they could glitch and kill people. I am against the idea of driverless cars.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,2,2
"The Electoral college should be abolished. This form of voting is unfair to the candidates. The people that vote for the candidates they only vote for a chance that their candidate may have enough people that voted for him or her in that state to recieve a slate of pre-selected electors. there is also a very likely chance that the voting may end in a tie and the election will preceed to the House of Representatives where the state delegations would vote for a president.

The electoral college is a verey unfair way of voting to the candidates because if the majority of U.S. citizens vote for an opposing candidate that candidate would have the chance to lose the election if the states favor the current president or other candidates. In the article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer states that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". On the other hand a fovored president has a higher chance of winning the election just by the vote of the electoral college.

When a state has election day the people who vote, vote not for the president but a slate of electors. When the state counts the votes, it then decides which party gets the slate of electors based on the majority of the votes and the elctors cast votes for their candidates. In the article IN Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner it states that ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". If ther ewas no electoral college the election would only rely on popular votes and in turn make the process of choosing a president easier and more simple. This process would also recieve distaste as does the electoral college.

As said by many the Electoral College should be abolished. The process is very complex and unfair. Why only dpend on a majority of state chosen elector when the citezens could be the electors. The only way to get a fair vote is without the electoral college.",2,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The ""Unmasking the Face on mars"" was journaled when they sent a drone out into space to take pictures of Planet Mars. When they were on expidition they found a face like thing in the ground luckily the drone was able to get a picture and it was a face embeded in the ground. Some people believe that it is an alien but we will never know.

After this broke headlines people started making movies and all, including the newpapers, T.V broadcastings and all. This continued all the way up till 2001. They still monitor the unmasking of the face, it slowly is starting to reveal itself.

What could this face be? Is it an alien or once a human being? Well we won't be finding out maybe for another decade or so, But it;s weird how it was there an nobody knew it was there till there was an expidition for it.

"Driverless cars may be coming in our future, but they most likely will not be commonly used. Driving a car run by a computer allows a number of problems to occur. Since 2009, driverless cars have been around. These cars are only considered driverless under certain conditions though. If the car is not reliable in all traffic conditions, people should not rely on them to get them where they need to go safely.

Society today relies on technology and computers for almost everything from talking to friends to sending military signals hundreds of miles. At times, even the most advanced technology glitches. Driving a car that is controlled by technology would pose the same problems. Would the car still drive if it started raining? What would happen if the rotating sensor on the roof glithched? A driver, assuming the car is driving, may not be attentive and see the signal given by the car for the human to take over. The car could crash causing even bigger problems than just faulty technology.

Crashes occur even when human drivers are in control of the car. It is inevitable that crashes are likely to happen in the autonomous cars as well. Paragraph 9 states that, ""in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" If these driverless cars are better than having a human behind the wheel, most states would allow them to be tested. Even if they were tested and allowed to be driven new laws would have to be put into place. In the case of an accident, would drivers or manufacturers be at fault for the accident? Drivers might claim that they did not see the signs that the car gave them signifying that the human was supposed to take over. Manufacturers would argue saying that the driver was unattentive to their surroundings.

Drivers who rely on computer driven cars may loose the skills needed to drive a car over time. If they do not drive in favorable conditions, because the car is driving, how will the manufacturers expect them to be able to drive in hazardous conditions. Practice makes perfect; without practice, a driver will not be close to perfect. Switching to cars being driven by humans in times of unstable conditons could potentially cause more accidents.

Driverless cars might sound like a fantastic idea. When the different risks are taken into consideration, a human life should be more important than not having to drive. The reliability of the autonomous cars is not strong enough at this time to be considered safe. Humans should keep driving cars and computers should stick to sending text messages.",3,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3
"Have you ever wanted to experience a life changing event?

Well, now you can.

In fact, by joining the Seagoing cowboys program you can do that and much more including: helping others, seeing and experiencing new things, and having fun along the way.

Since World War II Europe has been in ruins and many people are searching for help to recover. I alone can't do it all. So, this is why I am asking you to help with the job. With your help you can recover many countries' food supplies, animals and more. In fact, you may have the oppertunity to care for as much as or more than 300 some animals along the way. It helped make me more aware of peoples' and countries' needs and I am sure it will you too. Not to mention all of the incredible sights you will see.

We will have plenty of time to see and visit many wonderful sights and places along the way.

For example, the first time I went, we took about two weeks to crosss the Atlantic and about a month to get to China. Therefore we had a plentiful amount of time to relax and enjoy the sights and seans. You may also visit places during this time including Italy, Crete, and the Panama Canal. In these places you can take tours, ride in gondolas, and much more. Please don't forget the time included for fun.

Fun is added in many activities during the trip. One example of this is on the boat after returning from unloading animals. During this time we can play baseball, volleyball, and table tennis. We can also fence, box, read, whittle, and play many other games. Of corse by the time to leave you will always have a part left with you from your voyage, the memories.

Because of the Seagoing Cowboy's program also known as the UNRRA I am open to the world around me. Helping others, seeing and experienceing new things, and faving fun along the way has contributed in me experiencing a life changing event and I want you to experience this fantastic journey with me. So what do you say?

Are you ready to experience it too?",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming ""driverless"" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in ""Driverless Cars are Coming."" Due to its many benefits, driverless cars are a positive additon to our society.

Driverless cars offer a multitude of benefits for any passengers that might use them for transportation. For one, the necessity to have to buy or pay off a car would essentially cease to exist. If computer-operated vehicles were capable of driving in all areas, then what would the need for having your own car be? Even if the car wasn't ""fully automated"" and the driver would have to take over at some point, the less work you have to do, the more time you have to work on something else. The article addresses this topic ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The biggest asset that the consumer gains from a driverless car is time, while still being transported in a safe and reliable vehicle. This reinforces the advantages available to consumers who use a driverless car.

Speaking of safety, there is not a vehicle more safe than one that is more or less ""automatic."" With autmoated cars, drivers will be able to transport themselves without having to add the extra element of driving into a day that might be stressful. However, not all cars are fully capable to driving themselves yet without driver assistance. The good news? This innovation still grants a tremendous amount of safety to the driver in charge. The features previously cited as being used as tiem fillers can also be quickly changed to inform the driver that they need to take over: ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" An advantage to this approach is that if all communication and distractions from within the car is shut down, then the driver has no choice but to focus on the road, another argument for the push of driverless cars.

The last topic at hand with these types of vehicles skims along the lines of controversial. Liability is a very integral part of the car industry, accidents will always be an issue, as cited by the article: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" Would smarter cars help this problem? First off, it's important to acknowledge that accidents happen on the open road every day, with the primary cause being mistakes that drivers make. Therefore, manual vechicles are not necessairily dangerous, but are not as reliable as an automatic vehicle. Think about other practical additions that help consumers, such as a lifeguard on a beach. If they weren't there, would we be as safe? Probably not. Therefore, if the addition of driverless cars ensures that a safer option is available, then it only makes sense that the advantage should be taken.

In conclusion, driverless cars have brought about many new benefits in our society. From their ease of access to consumers to the top level of safety features that are sure to be made available in them, they will clearly become the top option of vehicle to use in our society once enough of them are made. This technological innovation is capable of doing many wonders in the automotive industry.",4,4,2,3,2,2,3,2,3
"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If this was a Face, Nasa would've been benefited more. Nasa has more proof that the Face is a natural landform.

This formation is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The shadows made the landform look like an Egyptain Pharaoh. The Face is a huge rock formation. If this formation was an actual face, Nasa would have benefited and earned money for their discovery of life on Mars. I also state that ""a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The Face of life on Mars is compared more times to a natural landform than a face of a Martain. These ""Faces""

are common around Cydonia. After long, eighteen years after the Viking missions had ended, our Mars Global Surveyor arrived at Mars in September 1997. We took photographs the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. The photo was ten times sharper than the other and we coud get a better view of the Face and it was just a rock landform and not an alien monument. Our cameras are very good quality and you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. We got a fantastic look at this so called ""Face"".

In conclusion, this Martain Face is just a natural landform on Mars. Shadows give of an illusion of a face and Nasa has discovered that there is no Martain activity linked to the Face.

"""How Humans Can Travel to Venus""

Venus, commonly known as Earth's ""twin"", is the closest planet to have almost the same size and density as Earth. When people first hear this, their minds quickly wonder if humans could ever live on Venus. Any time NASA conducted an experiment for Venus, they have always sent an unmanned spacecraft, and for a good reason. Each time the spacecraft landed or was close to the planet, it would last up to no more than three hours. What does this mean for humans? The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by introducing Venus's features, NASA, and technology.

Astronomers fight the question as to why they keep studing Venus by providing the information they have found. Venus is discovered to be a planet that used to have many Earth-like features. ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long frames of space travel"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). The author explains that Venus is the nearest option for humans to visit because of how close it is on the orbit. Scientists conclude that Venus might have had large bodies of water and could have supported other life forms, like on Earth. Venus also has features Earth has, like mountains, craters, and valleys. Since Venus already is a planet with very similar structures like Earth, it makes scientists think whether or not to take a little visit to Venus.

According to scientific research, Venus's temperature can go up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 90 times greater that what humans experience on Earth. Although the temperature on Venus can go up to bizarre numbers, NASA still comes through with an idea on how to send humans to Venus. ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). NASA concludes that if humans are to go on Venus, they would have to be in a blimp-like vessel and be about the ground to resist the scorching temperatures. The temperature woul still be at a high degree, almost at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but humans could still live and function at that rate. The air pressure would be close to that of Earth's sea level, which is survivable for humans.

NASA's idea of a blimp-like vehicle allows humans to start a journey to Venus. The technology made makes the trip to Venus possible for humans in the near future. Technology in the past has been able to make it close to Venus without humans, but it would always be destroyed in less that three hours. NASA and their scientists work everyday with technology to make it anyway easier to travel to Venus. Despite the dangerous temperature zones, the chances of destruction by the planet's impediments, and the very high pressure, technology can make it easier to adventure to Venus. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""). NASA has been already testing products with their technology to see if it would be compadable with Venus's climate, and the product has been able to adapt to the climate for three weeks. This means that if NASA starts to get the right technology for Venus, travel there wouldn't be as dangerous as they thought.

Venus's features, NASA and technology all support the author's statement as to why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers. Since Venus and Earth share similar features, scientists found that Venus also might have had large bodies of water, which may also bring other similarites to Earth. NASA has been studying and making plans about how humans will be able to travel the constant hot temperatures and climate at Venus, and found a way for humans to travel. Technology has made it easier to widthstand Venus's features and made ways for humans to be able to adapt. With all these changes, it makes it easier to let humans hop on board and travel to Venus, despite all dangerous remarks about the planet.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The author supports the suggestion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by providing benifits and solutions to exploring Mars.

In the text it states 'Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like plantet in our solar system'. This shows that by studying Venus we may learn that Venus was once like Earth.

In the text it also states 'recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit'. This shows that Venus is the easiest to get to in terms of speed/time.

Finally they provide ways that space agencies are working on solutions to exploring Mars. For this, the text states 'NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray'.

These support the authors' suggestion by showing reasons as to why we should study Venus and the fact that agencies already are researching solutions to exploring Venus.",1,1,3,3,2,2,1,1,2
"Have you ever heard of the audacious ""Seagoing Cowboys Program""? Let me tell you right now, when I joined, I knew that was the best desicion I ever made. My demeanor was a lot more joyus then ever before. I knew that helping and saving inocent people and animals was the right thing to do. When you join this program, you get to travel the world; help people that survived WWll; save animals; and much much more. I vehemently suggest that you join this audacious progam. You will have numerous amount of fun with me, Luke Bomberger, and my buddy Don Reist.

Let me tell you about some of our adventures. One time we went to the melancholy country, Europe. WWll had just taken place there, and we were helping them recover from this disasterous war. We were collecting numerous amounts of food for them to consume, we recovered their sweet inocent animals, and much much more. I can tell you one thing, after we left that melancholy country, thier demeanors definatley changed. They were very exuberant, and they thanked us more than you could ever possibly imagine. Don and I were off seeking to find more adventure.

After we left the melancholy country, Europe, we headed to Acropolis, Greece and Venice, Italy. But the real adventure was going to China. At China, we cattle-boated, and took care of the sweet animals. Taking care of these animals sure kept me busy. They absolutley had to be fed; and watered at least two or three times a day. Their smelly; nasty stalls had to be cleaned, and bales of hay and oats had to be pulled up from the lower part of the ship. I helped my aunt out on the farm as a boy, and it had prepared me for hard work. The hard work at the farm sure didn't prepare me for this hard work on the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy was more than an adventure for me. I am grateful for this oppertunity; this made me more aware of what other people's needs are. This program opened my eyes. The ""Seagoing Cowboys Program"" will forever be my favorite program. I was truely blessed with that exiting oppertunity. I am going to join again next year, you will see my name on the list, Luke Bomberger. I hope to see yours on the list also.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"do you want to know the truth about the red planet and the ""face"" on mars? the face on mars is just a natural landform and i can prove it.

if there really were aliens on mars NASA wouldnt hide it knowing that the taxpayers would donate more money to NASA if therce was actually anything out there to research. the second image first appeared on a JPL website revealing nothing but a rock formation. although the second image of the face was slightly out of focus and blurry due to the clouds, the third image from 2001 was ten times sharper and was taken with a better camera, still revealing a natural formation.

there is enough proof showing that the ""face"" on mars is not even a face its nothing but shadows and a rock formation. the pitures actually show the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the american west.",1,4,3,3,1,3,2,3,2
"I am for the development of smart/driverless cars. I have chosen to support these cars because they will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus, they can sense the road and dangers better, and the cars require little human attention.

Firstly, the cars will potentially replace taxi services. I think this will be a great idea because while you would still have to pay for the service, there is no human element of error. If there is an element of error, however, you will be the one at fault because you are the only passenger and driver. I believe the replacement of the traditional taxi service is a good thing.

The smart cars are good at sensing dangers on the road ahead. Because the cars have technology that can even start to turn on the brakes before the driver can, the driver will be safer and does not have to respond as quickly. The ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" is a good development because the driver must still remain alert but the car does most of the work.

Lastly, I think the smart cars are a good idea to develop because they allow the driver to be safe in a vehicle that they are not in full control of. A project manager driver from BMW, Werner Huber states, ""We have to interpret the driving in a fun new way."" I think that if the developers of the smart car add a type of entertainment to help the passenger stay interested, then the driver will still be alert.

I believe the development of the smart car is a good idea because people will not have to take a taxi anymore, the smart cars are more reliable, and the smart cars will require less attention from the driver. I believe that the smart cars will do a good job on the road and that there are very few risks if they are tested correctly.",3,3,1,2,3,2,2,1,3
"France, Germany , United States, Colombia and other countries are taking actions of the problems that the cars are making. It is true that cars are helpful and make the life easier to some persons but lately the concer of how this machines affect the ecosystem have being increasing. That is  why countries have come with different projects to try to limit the amount of cars they are around their cities. If we see from a different perpestictive the limiting of cars can be a good thing and produce result that are favorable to everyone.

Through the years they have been several projects of reductiond of car circulation and it is visible that the population have apadted to the type of living that cities have imposed.

One example of this is Vauban, Germany were 70 percent of the families do not have a car and 57 percent sold a car to move there. with that example we can see that people can get used to a live where cars are not necesary to have. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I am uch happier this way,"" these are the word of one of the resident of that city that get used to a lifestyle without a car. In that city people get used to walk which is more healty and do not produce any harm to the ecosystem.

Other cities like Paris have made laws to control the amount of pollution cars produce since , this capital have more smog than other European capitals making this a awful fact. With the actions they have made of baning even-numbered license plate on Mondays they have reduced the amount of smog which is good. Another example is what is happening in Bogota, Colombia where you can see car-free days, where people any other mean of transportations except for personal cars. When the actions of both cities atre taken it is visible the cahnge on the enviroment. This great ideas help the crouded cities to reduce their levels of pollition and icentive people on use the car less.

United State that is a country that produces a lot of pollution have seen good changes in the tendenci of the people of using car. Studies have prove that the amount of new cars buied have decrease in the last years. Also there have been a drop of the amount of people getting a license. This show that is a county support public transportation and make programs that will make people use less the cars they will have a positive result.

Walking and using a bike is good for the personal healt. The less using of the cars help the fight against pollution and avoid the rise of temperature in the earth. Obesiti and pollution are a big problen in the last decades but they both share something in common, they can be fought by using less a car and walking, being this the perfect statement that prove why limiting the car usage will be an adventage.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,0
"The author suggests that studing Venus is worthy for many reasons. Those reasons are how simular Venus is to Earth, it would be the easiest planet to visit, and it wold be the safest planet to study.

In the passage it states ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantge point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closly."" Venus is dangerous to explore,but Venus seems fascinating to study.

Venus is very simular to Earth. In the passage it states. ""Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system."" Venus is much like Earth. Venus could be coverd with oceans, and also have various forms of life."" It would be interesting to see if or what forms of life Venus could have.

Another reason why Venus would be worthy to study is it would be the easiest planet to visit.

"I think the state senator should change the electoral college to vote for the president of the united states. I  think it would be a lot easier to do and make sure a president would be elected. They also wouldnt have to worry about it being a tie. And if it was a tie then they would be able to decide who the winner would be. Also the people will be able to vote for the president of the united states and won't have to worry about the electors voting for someone else that they didn't vote for. They also don't have to pay attention if the president were picked by a popular vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election. The electoral college method of selecting a president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The residents of the other reigons are likely to feel disenfranchised to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

I'm going to be against to their technology that they're using because they are using the technology to see what other people feel about something. The technolgy could tell how we feel by the facial expression and your movements of the facial muscles. They are looking for a better way for human and computer to communicate. The computer could model the face of the 44 major muscle like a human muscles movement is called a action unit. i don't like the computer to see our emotion because its like someone watching or i feel like someone stalking like watching what i'm doing. They could use in the classroom to see someone who is bored or confused of the worked. The computer could when u smile but we know it doesn't lie about what u feel. If u fake smile it could tell that ur not really smiling. They were studying the picture painting of mona lisa to see if it show the feeling what she have. They want to studying the facial expression on the painting or real life face. They are studying the emotion of what people feel about. They are creating the emotion on other people feeling.,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? I cannot see this happening. I cannot see this happening because of three reasons: technology sometimes fail, machines are built to help humans, and technology is unreliable. I believe that driverless cars should not be invented.

First, I will be explaining my first reason on why I say that driverless cars should not be invented. In the great tragedy of the Challenger, the technology of that space shuttle failed and it was not an driverless machine. Also, the driverless cars have not been proven to be able to handle certain situations while driving which can cause another tragedy.

Next, I am going to explain my second reason on my thesis. Machines are bulit to help humans, for example without the invention of the assembly line would have made the possiblity of modern day cars to be impossible. Also, the invention of automobiles and airplanes were invented to get from one place to another in a quicker fashion than walking or biking.

Finally, I am going to explain to you my final reason. Technolgy is unreliable, computers freeze and shut down on their own all the time. There are various examples of technolgy being unreliable. These cars could shut off in the middle of the highway which could causes many deaths or injuries, or even go off the road and crash causing personal injuries.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars should not be invented. I say this because of the three reasons i provided you with. I believe that it would be an safety hazard, and it will cause conflict between the cars manufacturer and the cars owner.",2,4,0,2,0,1,1,0,1
"The authors claim supports the idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despites the danger becase their are conditions that they have to be careful with. My first reason is that not many people survive for hours. My second reason is that the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth. My third reason is that technology tends to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

"" Each previos mission was un manned, and for good reasons, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" When they are flying and trying to land carefully, and they are in the ground the spaceship might end up exploting. "" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades."" So they can tell why it didn't land safely to venus.

"" ... such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" If you go way to deep in the ocean you would liquefy many metals."" ... weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This can couse many different weathers.

"" Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" If you do a physical condition something can happen to you. "" By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" If you have something mechanical part around you it can melt in your body and it will burn yor skin.

In conclusion, all of the conditions that they said that can happen to you can couse you to die. When you are in a spaceship try to land carefully so nothing bad happens to you.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The author supports this idea because he brings it up more than once. For instance in the beginning of the passage the author mentions that the spacecraft has used cameras and other robots. The sad part is they didn't survive more than a few hours.""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than few hours.""

The author gives details on certain things that we should be aware of. He doesn't just release it with one fact and stay with that. He tells the people about stuff we already know about or things that aren't healthy for humans. ""A thick atomsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atomsphere. On the plansureface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" As humans we know what nhow our bodies will react to tempatures like that. The author isn't sugarcating anything for humans.

My conclusion to this is that the author he is telling the truth despite the dangers like possibly dying before coming within two feet of the atomsphere that Venus is a worthy pursuit the only problem is how can we pursuit it if we have nothing that can make it past it. What the author does here is really let us know the dangers then explain why it's like that. That really helps because if i didn't have that i'd be confused out of my mind.",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Venus is a very dangerous planet and has harsh storms, earthquakes, and a bad atmosphere. But despite all that, the studying of venus is more important than worrying about the dangers that lurk there. In the article ""The Challenge of

Exploring Venus"" the author also supports this claim pretty well.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He explains that Venus has very harsh conditions that you couldn't live there or even land there without surviving for only a few hours. It has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 % Carbon Dioxide, there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees. They even say such conditions could crush a submarine or melt any metal.

However despite all that information I just gave you, the author still thanks it's important that we study Venus in the future. He goes on to say "" why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", and then explains that astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have been the Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author suggests that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. He even states "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

The author gose on to say, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"".

He begins to say that NASA has an idea for sending Humans to study Venus. It would allow scientist to float above the scorching ground and just hover in the air.

Finally in the last paragraph of this article really shows how much he thinks that studying venus is more than important than worrying about the dangers of the planet. The author states "" striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavours. Out travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

In conclusion the author supports his opinion on studying Venus is more important than worrying about dangers. He supports this opinion by stating that venus is a crazy planet but still says why we should explore. He even says Venus could've been most Earh-like planet out there, and earth still has similar features.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"We have created a face on the surface of our planet. Doesn't that sound stupid, I mean if there is intellagent life out there why would they waste there time puting a face on a planet. That face is nothing but a mountain or rock formation that looks like a face.

First off the area the probe was flying over and taking pictures of was know to have mesas. Like the article had said at in paragraph two "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Which is where the probe was flying over. Most scientist believe it is just a landform with the face looking structure.

Next when NASA got another probe into space to take better pictures, just to show the people like you who think it was made by aliens that it is in fact just a rock formation. They took another picture and people still didn't believe them so depsite how hard it is to position it to take another picture they did it anyway and it looked nothing like a face, But more like a mountain.

Lastly most of the stuff made up about the face on mars. when they released the photo like it said in the article ""it stared in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" It's just made up by people to either sell more stuff in there gift shop or store and or make movies and books. Because who would want to watch a movie about the extroudanary mountain on mars. They would have to make false info about it and say it was made by aliens so it would sell more.

You may say that that probe is floating very far away from space how do you know there is not any evidence of life down there? Well yes It is very far away but the picture was taken in maxium resilution. Each pixel spans 1.56 meters so each pixel in that photo spaned 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see anything that would have show alien life down there.

So yes it was nothing but a mountain that looked like a face. Next time you look at somthing that looks like it could be alien in outer space don't believe movies or novels belive the scientist they know what there doing and know what is for the better of human knowledge not some persoon trying to make some money by saying that aliens made it so you would buy it.",3,3,3,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Emotions are the most hardest things to understand from yourself or from others, usually people can identify them if they now the situation that has, had or is about to happen. But there are some emotions or facial expressions that people just don`t know or understand what it`s supose to be or mean. This can be said for any thing. This can be said for about anything, but what would happen if someone had a machine that can tell you, mathematically and calculate what emotions you are felling or have felt if it is a photo.

To explain the machine , it is a computer the constructs a 3-D computer model of a face. It reconizes all 44 major muscles in a face of a model and must move like human muscles. It roconizes the action unit of a more muscles in a face. the machine was created by DR. Paul who created the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) and Dr. Huang. It basically tracks and understands differnt empotions by tracking and understanding facial expressions, since people le understand how a person feels based on physical expressions of the face. The computer is then able to under stand a persons emotion.

This level of technology is advense, but what would happen if this kind of computer was mobile and was used in a school, by teachers to know what emotions a student was feeling, to and they used as if it were a lie detector. Well there are pros for the teachers, like if a student was lieing to them about an assignment or a use it to understand what happened in their class by simply scanning the students and use the information they have to esstimate an answer. It would be convenient for the teacher or even a priciple to figure out what the student is feeling. Usually a teacher would ask the student about what happened to the student. They would use the computer if they don`t care and only want the truth from the student as a positive answer they would understand. They computer would most likely idintify someone who is lying and get punishment. It could also help a teacher understand if the student is under stress and would be able to do something before the student does something that would their greatest mistake they could end up taking. Other reasons is being able to find out why a student is queit and not talking to everyone that are his or her friends. They would even be able to find out secrets that a student is keeping from them, if it`s good or bad the teacher would simply be able to figure out what it is.

With every pro there is a con that exist, for one how would the computer be able to be mobile, the computer that can calulate emotions would be huge and bulky to carry aroung. Plus there arew few apps that can tell emotions ,even if they have a few mistakes. Besides that it would be consider an invasion of privacy, since most people would want to keep something a secret, like love. It would even something that students would try to get away from it either try to keep it a truth and really saying that you did an assignment or risk it all and get caught.

From all this information having aving a computer that teel emotions would have it`s ups and down,some being able to find some who has lied and catch them and even helping someone who have problems with themselves or at home. The con is that people would try to avoid it, or if they had to understand something they could just ask the student and have a conversation with them about whats wrong ang why. Having an emotion computer have some percs, but would be use on rare occasions.",2,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"I think driverless cars are a great invention. Driverless cars would make everyone's lives easier. It would save lots of time, and even keep people safer. I think everyone should have access to self driving cars. This technology could help us improve our lives, and open a new world of technology for us.

I strongly agree with Google cofounder, Sergy Brin, on his ideas about public transportation. Public transportation systems that self drive would be amazing. It would indeed change the world. These cars would make transportation extremely easy, and replace old cars.

These cars could also make driving even more safer for people. The self driving cars have sensors that can auto brake. This could prevent many accidents in the future, and maybe save lives. Although this technology may help, it all lies on the driver. This technology may cause carless drivers. All in all, the technology of driverless cars could make driving safer than it is today.

"The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system. It would accomplish this by closer to a real democracy, and forcing the candidates to win over more people.

A democracy has long been revered as one of the best forms of government. It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable?

Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get.

There is no real reason to keep the electoral college. It serves as a pointless middle man to an otherwise great government. Popular vote requires more out of the candidates, and puts more say into the individual vote.",3,4,1,3,1,2,2,3,3
"""Its a good thing for computers to be able to tell human emotion?"" Well Dr. Huang thinks it is a good idea.

Now Dr. Huang's computer syestem can tell six human emotion's and let me tell u somthing human's only have six emotion's those emotions are (happiness, surprised, angery, disgusted, fear, and sadness). the computer can recognize the subtle facial movments we human's have to express hoe we feel.

Computers use this thing called CALCUATE EMOTION'S it those are your thinking part of your emotions like as simpole as solving a math problem and doing your work or thinking ahead.

"So the face on mars. Many poeple say the face is a alien landmark. Well I dont. Im gonna explain to you why the it isnt. Also that it is just a natural made landform.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalnet of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American west. "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho,"" say Garvin. ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars.

So on april 5, 1998, when Mars Globsl Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars oebiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a jpl web site, revealing... an natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

A few days later NASA unvield the image for all to see. the caption noted a "" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" This is a great explanation for the way the face looks.

So there you have it. I say that the face is just a natural made landform. There is no evidence to show other wise. With the better camera we were able to find out that its not an alien atrifact. So yes it is not a alien atrifact.",1,4,3,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Imagin waking up to a peaceful sound, which means that there is barely cars outside. No traffic, no noise. Would in you like that. Many people probably have desired this. People would wake up in a more relaxed, joyful mood. since there is bearly cars outside. You could get to work or somewhere else faster, without traffic being the isue. You could also walk or cruse the road without any accedents. Yes, I think that they should limit the car usage.

To begin with, cars have a negavite effect. in source 1 it states that ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropiations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" which this means is that more money is going to repair highways. Instead of this money going to other couses like to student education. I n source 2 it says ""After days of near- record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Cars are cousing air pollution which is bad for the envirenment. Pollution is bad for the air. The air becomes toxic, that one day we will no be able to breath in it. Also in source 2 ""cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions."" this is one of the ways that car pollution is effecting the earth and its atmosphere. The plants will start to die because the air toxic. this does not just effect the plants or air it also effects us and animals ina way. we are used to breathing clean air that when it's toxic, our lungs will not function right, and we could also die.

Moreover, in many places they are using programs. In source 3 ""in a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Avoiding cars is a good thing because instead of driving everywhere, they can finally enjoy thier surroundings. They would just go to the place they need to go and back home. That was their life. With that one day they can realize that they are missing out on a beautiful day. in source 4 ""New York's new bike-sharing program anhd its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new prioities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation.""

"Voting is one of the hardest choices a person has to make because in reality the votes for the american perident can be decided by one or two votes sometimes. The two deciding factors in voting are the electoral college and the popular vote of the people. They both make the elections fair but also unfair. Without one the whole election process would not be as good as it is today.

The Electoral College is comprised of a total of 538 electors and to elect a president you need a majority of 270 votes from the 538. This electoral college is comprised of one vote for each representative from your state plus two for the senators. Obviously this gives every state a fair chance to vote but even if lets say Hawaii, North Dakota, and South Dakota wanted republican and Texas wanted democrat Texas' votes would cancel out the others because of the amount of representatives they have compared to the other three states. This is one thing that makes this form of voting very unfair. Obviously it is smart to give somestates more representatives because of their population but that completly defeats the purpose of making it fair because the small states stand no chance against the densely populated ones like Florida, Texas, California, and New York.

The popular vote is the percentage of votes that the president recieves form the people, citizens that are voting for them. The popular vote does not haver as much effect as the Electoral College but it still does make an effect. For example in 2000 when Al Gore had 60% of the popular vote but did not win the presidency because George Bush had the majority of the Electoral College. This is when the popular vote should be more emphasized because obviously the people which is over about 20 Million wanted Gore but the Electoral College vote of more than only 270 people wanted Bush. That is an issue but also some people voting don't really understand what the two people are offering and just vote because one sounds better, looks cooler, your friends are voting for him/her. This is why the popular voting system cannot be fully trusted.

The compare the two topics not one is better than the other and not one can fuction woithout the other. In my perspective it was smart of the founding fathers to create both systems so that the voting would be somewhat fair. In reality even though the popular vote doesn't make a difference it can persuade the representatives of the state to change their mind or it can make them realize that they are making the right decision because of how their state is chosing to vote. This should change their mind because the people elected them knowing that they will vote for who they promised to vote for and will most likely stay true to their state and to their party.

In conclusion both system are great together but apart cannot funcion. The founding fathers and leaders of this country cannot be blamed for making this system because there is really no way to make it fair and they did their best to do so. Now think if you were to design the voting system for the United States of America what woudl you do differently or the same.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"The technology in today's world just keeps getting crazier and crazier! What do you think about Driverless Cars? Driverless Cars shouldn't be developed. The thought of this idea just sounds dangerous. Driverless cars shouldn't be develeoped for many reasons such as; saftyness, expenses, and lazyness.

Safetyness is a big issue when it comes to cars. Just think about all of the rules that we have today reguarding safety with cars. Driverless Cars could cause accidents and many new laws to be made just because of the safety issues. As stated in paragraph 7, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" By saying this, who knows if they ever will really have a completey Driverless Car. Without being completely driverless, something could go wrong at any time and that isn't a good or safe thing.

The expenses of cars today are outrageus, but think about the cost for a Driverless Car. The prices of a driverless car will cost the inventors and the buyers. The inventors have to pay billions of dollars to complete a car that functions all by itself, which is going to be very expensive. All of the parts and technology are already high in todays vehicles, so a Driverless Car is definitely going to be high in price. The money being put into Driverless Cars could be going into more important things.

Driverless Cars will cause a lot of lazyness in today's world. Many people already text and do other things while driving, so imagine what they would if they didn't have to drive at all. The population of texting in driving would increse. People would probably fall asleep while driving, which can result in car accidents. This invention also involves people being lazy because they wont even have to learn how to drive anymore. The less people don't know about driving the lazier they can be, because they won't have to do anything when it comes time to drive.

Driverless Cars shouldn't be made due to safetyness, expenses, and lazyness. The car could mess up and cause an accident at any time, which isn't safe. Expenses for the Driverless Car would be very pricey and a waste. Lazyness will increase, because people won't have to learn to drive.",3,3,1,3,0,0,1,1,1
"Our Universe is big, and even that is an understatement. It would take thousands upon thousands of years just to explore our own galaxy. Beyond ours are millions if not billions or trillions of other galaxies waiting to be explored. For now though, our best course of action seems to be to explore our own personal solar system. Although this continues to prove difficult to accomplish. Why? Well look no forward than our neighboring planet and what's considered as ""Earth's Twin"" Venus!

You think with a nickname like that it be relatively simple to land on. That part has been pretty much nailed down but the real dilema is attempting to have the spacecrafts continuing functionallity on the surface. According to the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" it states that: ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus' atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (Para. 3) With a description like that, It definetly wouldn't be the ideal vacation destination, let alone for a single person to stand on. Even for a spacecraft it's a brutal environment. To put it in perspective, the article states: ""Such an evironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqufiy many metals."" (Para.3) I think you can understand why the average life expectancy of a probe is so little.

Why do we continue to explore it though, well scientists predict that at one point Venus could have been a sutiable spot to sustain life. The article states: ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains and craters."" (Para.4) Though the article doesn't state this, Keep in mind that for valley's and mountains to form you'd need some sort of body of moving liquid to erode and shape it's surface. Another big factor is being it's proximity, the article states that: ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that we are sometimes closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" (Para. 2) This proves to be a redeeming quality this strategy since a probe or even manned mission wouldn't cost nearly as much (regarding fuel) and would be rather easy to return home from.

In actuallity though, How do we purpose to send people there. We'll we're most likely going to use a tactic that seems almost larger than life. The article purposes that: ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian land. Just as our jet airplans travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" (Para. 5) This seems absolutley ridiculous but based on research it could prove to be a viable option. Although it's the safest way to attempt a manned mission to Venus, it's not without its flaws. According to the article: ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" (Para.5) regarding the climate on the ground though, I think 170 degrees Fahrenheit would be considered a saving grace from God.

Only time will tell what mysteries lie beneath the surface of Venus' foggy and dense atmosphere. As technology and hospitalty advances, we may soon be able to even attempt a manned mission. One can dream but it seems that the future continues to be ever the more promising as we will begin to learn more and more about our troublesome sister planet.",3,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"Many people are afraid of the concept of driverless car, and I cannot say that I blame them. These people believe that new, driverless cars could lead to a myriad of crashes injuries, and deaths, because the cars do not have the intelligence or driving capabilities as an average human driver. While I do understand why these people fear the future with self-driving cars, I also understand that they are wrong, simply because they are misinformed, and unknowledgible about the topic.

Self-driving cars are exactly what they sound like, cars that are able to control themselves without the input or command of a human driver. They use advanced sensors and technology to achieve this. While many people think that these cars could only appear in the distant future, they are, in fact, driving around right now.

Google's self-driving car is an example of one such current driverless car. It has been driving itself for months now, and has been in only a few wrecks, all of which were caused by human error, either by someone in a different vehicle or by the human driver of the car, when the self-driving technology was turned off. This shows that driverless cars are in fact, safer than cars driven by humans.

Also, imagine if all the cars on the road were self-driving cars. Because these cars constantly send out signals to drive, what if they could send signals to other driverless cars around them, informing them of what is happening on the road ahead. There's a road block on the your next turn? Your car could be informed to take a detour, to save time and energy.

Driverless cars also mean that the people who were previously driving no longer have to. A busy person could work on his computer on his way to work, or could be sending an important email. Or perhaps someone, having just been out drinking with friends, will no longer be able to drive drunk, they could just tell their cars to take them home, saving people from being injured or killed by drunk drivers. The same could be said about truckers or people going on road trips, who sit at the wheel for a long time. Instead of potentially falling asleep at the wheel, killing or injuring themselves or someone else, nothing would happen, as they were not driving in the first place.

In my honest opinion, self-driving cars are a huge step to the future, and a huge step towards making the world a little safer. While the fears or loss of control or technological malfunction in these cars, causing them to crash, is real and legitimate, it has been shown time and time again that those concerns are not a real problem. The pros definitely outweigh the cons in this sinario. The rise of driverless cars mean less accidents, because they virtually eliminate human error. They allow for people to have more time, instead of driving they can do more important things, and can completely stop drunk drivers. Driverless cars are better in pretty much every way; we just need to spread the news and inform people why it is the case.",4,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,3
"Fellow citizens their are many advantage to limiting your car usage. With a wide range from not getting a ticket to helping the enviroment, and it's a social trend, driving cars are now a thing of the past.

In Vauban, Germany a community where only thirty percent of its entire population owns vehicals. The advantages for not owning a car are displayed in this upscale community by the ablity to walk, and ride a bicycles to stores, shops, and restaruants. The secret to this the innovative take on this community, is by not placing these all of stores, shops, and restaruants in some crowed mall, but accesible from a mere walking distant. Also a great way to burn off calories and in time put an end to obesity.

By reducing car usage smog and other pollutants in big cities can be drastically reduced. In Paris congestion of smog was down sixty percent, the way they got people to stop using cars was by putting a fine driving your car for the day almost 4,000 drivers were fined thirty one dollars that day. Another example of this is in Bogota, Colombia here most the millions of  people were willing to give up car usage, a program that was started in the mid 1990s called the Day Without Cars with it's goal is to promote an altenative transportation. As a result of this added 118 miles of bicycle track, parks, and sports center to this city. Lower emissions of green house gases are also helping the enviroment with the help of Day Without Cars program.

People are slowly drifting away from their cars. The miles driven per person in the U.S. has dropped nearly nine percent since it's original peak in 1995. Many things have been suggested to reduced the car usage in the U.S. The number of car ownership per household and per person has come down three years before the downturn of car usage that started in the 2005. People in the U.S. are also more likely to retain a drivers license at an older age as to opposes to the younger age groups between 16-to-39-year-olds.

In conclusion, the age of cars are slowly coming to an end. People are planing for the cleaner and healther future that lies ahead of us, where pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation are woven together into a connected network.

"Do you really think that there is alien life? The picture shown is land on Mars. NASA said that it was a shadow giving a ""illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.""

However, it might just be possible for the teacher to read you emotions and adjust the lesson for you. I am going to give you two reasons why I believe that using technology to read emotional expression of students in a classroom is highly valuable.

One reason this is valuable is so students do not get bored. One of the things that makes school not so fun for kinds is how uniteresting the lesson is. In paragraph 6 of an article tited ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Dr, Huangs says "" A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" With this technology you would never have to worry about another super boring lesson.

Another reason why this is valueable technology for classroom use is because teachers can see how the student is feeling about the lesson. In paragraph 6, it also states "" Imagine a computer knows when you're happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if your frown, the next ad will be different."" This could also be applied to a teacher. If the teacher sees that the lesson is making the students happy they can go on teaching the way they are teaching.

"Face On Mar's

Have you ever heard a face that is on Mar's. See there is a face on Mar's that has been there for 25 years. Reseachers have came a cross it when they were doing study of the planenet called Mar's. The NASA took a picture of the face but the reaseaches really couldn't see it. This took place in 1976.

This Face looked like a human face. Reaseaches was amazed how this face popped up on mar's. The face was talked about all around the world. It was in magazines, books, and radio talk showes. This face on mar's was amazing at time. It started out in Hollywood and started to spread around.

The face on mar's started to die out of it's fame. Then reaseaches came a cross it again but this time flew over it and took a photo of it again. This time the reaseaches could see a little more deatail of the face. This took place in 1998. The NASA say they flew over it for the first time.

Reaseachers study on it really hard but thire mission faulted again. Everyone says that they think it was from alliens. Even a few reaseachers say they think it was from alliens. It was hard for them to see if it was from alliens or not.

"To what lengths will one go in the name of discovery? In the article, ""The Challenge of Expolring Venus,"" the author goes into great detail descrbing the dangers of venus in regards to overall climate and pressure. However, they also state that its striking similarties to Earth would make the arduous trip worth the while. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author strongly supports their idea of supporting travel and explorations of Venus through use of tone and argumentation skills.

Venus, commonly known as Earth's ""twin,"" is a planet often regarded with mystery and wonder. The author states that, ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft... unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived... more than a few hours"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2). Doing so, they introduce a sense of uneasiness to the reader and a need to continue reading. Then, the author goes on to counter this with comparisons to Earth-like or somewhat survivable conditions on Venus, such as similar radiation and airpressure levels. According to the author, Venus has ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 6). By introducing this counter statement, the article's author attempts to downplay the immense risks and gives a sense of reassurance. overall, the author harnesses specific tone elements to support his argument.

Throughout the article, the author emphasizes the dangers and horrible, risky conditions of Venus, but successfully counters them with agruments providing evidence to the benefits of exploring and current steps taken to ensure safety and possible missions to the planet. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hositile conditions... would allow scientists to tfloat above the fray"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 5). The author attempts to formulate arguments that would make a trip to Venus a seemingly ""indisputable"" option. He also goes on to highlight the fact that although modern and flexible technologies would be unable to withstand the acidic and extremely hot climate of Venus, NASA is looking to reinvent the mechanical computer system used in World War II. In doing so, the author gives valid evidence to the reader, provoking thoughts in support to the article's claim.

Venus is a dangerous planet, but the curiosity of the human race appears to trump the fears of exploration. The author of the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" utilizes strong tone and compelling counter arguments to support their claim. The article also displays arguments from both sides, and allows the reader to understand the risks, but also be wooed by the oppsing view. This provokes the question, is there ever truly a limit to man's curiosity?",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"l personally do not agree with driverless cars. l think that they they are not as safe as a human driving a car could be. l think that people are being to lazy drive your car and go on with life.

l think that the driverless cars would cause alot more accidents then a regular car would. the driverless cars would nit be as responsive to certain citustions as a human would be such as, a drtiver runs a red light the driverless car would not be able to notice that car as fast as a human would ther fore causing an accident.

i think that the idea of notifing the driver when there is a construction zone or something like that is a good idea but, if the driver is asleep and does not respond fast enough what will happen then. Will the car be able to notify the driver fast enough if a car cuts you off or runs a redlight? Will the car be able to see the blindspot?

l think that the driverless car is cool and all but l dont think that are safe at all. lf they can make the driverless cars safer and more responsive l think they could be a good idea but for now they are not safe enough. Why fix something thats not broken?",1,3,0,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Driverless cars have many postiive and negative effects and ideas that they could have on our world.

The driverless car that Google cofounder Sergey Brin invisions ""would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" (P1)

This would allow for the United States to purchase less fuel and in the end prevent us from spending so much money.

These kind of cars would be a great help to anyone making a long distance trip.

You could begin your trip one day and fall asleep and have driven several hours.

The idea has been tested by many different companies and is still being developed to this day.

Driverless cars would be a great benefit to the people of America, it would allow for people to save money on gas, and not have to worry about crashing because the car would drive itself.

With all of the sensors and other driverless cars, it would seem that the manufacturers could prevent accidents.

I believe that driverless cars could be a great benefit to this country, but they cannot replace all cars with them.

We still need fire trucks and police vehicles to keep people safe, but they would have a great impact on our nation.

One way that some companies are making driverless cars is by using ""smarter roads."" (P3)

General Motors for expample designed a concept car that could run on a special test track.

This track would send radio signals to the front end of the car.

Another way that some companies are trying to make driverless cars are by using sensors.

Google modified a Toyota Prius with ""position-estimating sensors, a rotating sensor, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" (P4)

Google used all of these sensors in different ways to begin to develop their own version of the driverless car.

The driverless car has been attempted by many different companies and each one has their own version with their own flaws.

Driverless cars seem to be a thing of the future, but in reality it could be here before we know it.

With all the different technology and all the money some of these big companies have it is a wonder the driverless car is not invented already.

The different companies have designed driverless cars now that still require the assistance of a driver.

The cars can brake, accelerate, and stop by themselves.

""All are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (P7)

This allows for some people to argue that driverless cars are not reliable, and it is not that at all.

Driverless cars have no way of knowing what to do in a situation like that.

The smart thing is to have the driver take over in that spot and would prevent a potential accident.

The problem with this is that the car needs some way of notifying the driver if he falls asleep.

Some designers have thought to use a vibration in the seat to alert the driver.

The Google car for example has a voice that announces when the driver needs to take over.

""Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays."" (P7)

One big argument when it comes to driverless cars is the potential for an accident.

The worry is that if the technology in the car quits working and the car crashes, who do you blame?

To me it seems like the manufacturer should be blames since they designed the car with the technology that failed.

The driver had no control over the technology, he just had to wait until the car needed his assistance.

This argument is one of many when it comes to driverless cars and it is an important one.

If the car crashes somedbody has to get blamed and if the driver is not actually driving why would he get blamed.

This could be one debate that pushes back the release of the driverless car until someone comes up with a compromise.

In conclusion, I believe that driverless cars would be a great benefit to our country as a whole.

I assume and hope that a company will release a driverless car in the next few years to allow me to experience such a thing.

It would be like a roller coaster.

You do not know how you are going to get where you are going and do not know how bumpy the ride will be but it will be an adventure.

That is what intrigues me the most about driverless cars, the adventure that is coming.

""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" (P10)

This just makes me even more excited for the release of driverless cars, it could happen in the next 4 years.

A driverless car would be a great invention and would allow the United States to make money if they were able to produce it and sell it.

Driverless cars are coming to us soon and they are going to excite many people because of the technology put into it, and also the seemingly magic wayt hat it drives you.

""The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" (P10)",2,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Limiting car ussage lowers the polution rates. A quote from lisabeth Rosenthal's passge ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"", ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Many people can go without personal cars and making smarter ways for transportation such as a bike, a bus, or carpooling with a friend to get to their destonation. A statment from the passage ""

Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog ."" ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifting smog..."" Meaning less cars make the road safer by limiting the number of cars allowed to drive on that certain day.

Places are banning cars on the roads on certain days to limit the number of drivers and limiting the amout of polution. From the passage ""

In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars ."" it states ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."""" By telling drivers they can only drive on certain days helps the environment and cutes back on smog and accidents.

The United States is also joining in on the ""smart planning"" movement by cutting back on the number of drivings on the road and number of cars owned by people. More people are taking the bus now rather than wasting and polution their gasoline. More people everywhere are taking bikes, walking, and carpooling with a friend to save money and gas. We now have electric cars where we can charge our cars in an outlet rather than filling up the tank with gasoilne.

It is better for you to walk or ride a bike to your destionation its smarter too. If you ride your bike, walk, take the bus, or carpool with a friend you are impaction greatly on the environment by reducing accidents and limiting smog. You can also save money on not taking your car everyday to work or school, taking the bus or carpooling can do alot.",0,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Many people are not using vehicles anymore. It could be more alternatives for transportation are showing up, to lower air pollution rates, the goverment might be forcing citizens not to use their vehicles, the enviroment they live in, or simply citizens have no interest in driving. There are many reasons to not driving, but maybe there are advantages to limiting car usage.

Some cities have been built where streets, driveways and garages for home are forbidden, such as, Vauban, Germany. These suburban communities have used every other way of transpotation except cars, taxis, buses, and some even trains; they pretty much use anything that doesn't have an engine. Many citizen like not have to drive everywhere. In Source 1, paragraph 3, """"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two."" Many of the citizen that live in Vauban give the same answer or just want something different in their lives.  In France, the govermnent enforced a partial driving ban to clear smog in the city get rid of traffic. In Source 2, paragraph 5, ""Congestion has down 60% in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog."" The lower rates of traffic congestion helped a significant amount of French citizens to get to where they were going faster and less accident on the road.

Other countries have created a somewhat holiday called car-free day where millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during that day. The only vehicles on the road were buses and taxis. In Source 3, paragraph 7, ""These people are generating a revolutionary changeand this crossing the borders.""

Also notable, Venus has the hottestsurface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

The author evaluates the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus has been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article the author states, ""Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us"". He also states Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"". These quotes proves that the author supports the idea to study Venus Because it's alomost closer to the sun and if disappears we will be next to be in the same situation.

In additition the author evaluates the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus covers largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. In the article the author says,""Venus from a ship or hovering safely far above the plant can provide only limited insight on ground conditions. He also states, "" Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risks"". These two quotes provides that the author will work on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

In conclusion Venus would be studied because it's in a bad situation and if probably disappears we will be more closer to th sun and we acn be in bad situation just like Venus. The author evaluates the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus has been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and because it coverd's largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.",3,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The aurther support the idea of space travling very well. He also stated that it well benfit the people on earth as we over came these challeges and solvoed them.

The first to paragarphs say that venus is some time the closes planet to the earth and is more like earth then we think. We have try to land numerous unmanned spacecraft to venus both non have survived the landing for more then an a few hours do to the extreme atomsphere.

The auther said that we could benfit by overcoming the high tempertures and amaking a stronger matrial that can with stand the sulfuric acid atmosphere. Another way we could benfit form is by making stong submarine so we would be able to dive deeper into the deepest parts of the oceans on earth.

The auther said that NASA idea of flying over venus is one way we could overcome the hard surface conditions that venus. That we would never run out of energy because venus is the second close planet to the sun. The temp is at around 170 degrees fahrenheit and that radiation levels are low so it is survivable for humans.

In conlusion to my essay about ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I can that striving to meet challenges preseented by venus has value and the insight that we would gain on the planet and what we can then use to improve life on earth is priceless.",2,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many reasons why not only me but others say that driveless car are a bad idea. Cars are made for humans to contorl them. Some cars are not as driveless because they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issuse, navigating through roadwork or accidents. Driverless cars must know where you want to go to take you there. This will not help anyone learn how to drive cars the right way if they do it for you. This is just like a teacher helping a student on his or her big test.

Driverless cars are not safe. Why might people say that? Well in the story Driveless Cars Are Coming it said that many futurists believed the key to developing self-driving cars wasn't so much smarter cars as smarter roads. Uses posittion- estimating sensors on the leeft rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera, a GPS receiver. What happens if these things goes out? Who can we blame the driver or the manufacturer?

The car will have alot of problems someone can get injured if the technology goes out. Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't driveers get bored waiting for their turn? Such displays can be turned off instantly hen the driver needs to take over. Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers , passengers, and others sfae.",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Would you ever want to have a job that you could explore the ocean and visit many different countrys and see unique things. It would be nice to have a job like that

In the passage ''A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves''this boy named Luke bomberger, who just graduated high school had two jobs and he got offered by his friend Don Reist to join this exiting event. Luke could not say no.

In the passage Luke said that he enjoyed the job A lot. There was many things he got to do like go over seas,he rescued animals,and more. It states in paragraph 3 that he traveled with 335 horses on August,14,1945. In my opinion that is a lot of horses on one boat.

He got to travel many places like Europe,China,Greece and more. He said that it takes about two weeks to get to cross the Atlantic ocean and a month to get to China. left time to play baseball,vollyball,tabletennis,fencing,boxing reading,and more. it says in the intro in the passage that he traveled 16 times over the Atlantic Ocean and twice over the Pacific Ocean.

As you can see it would be A lot of fun to be A seagoing cowboy. You would get to adventure things just like Luke did. In my opinion that would be A lot of fun to travel over seas and save people and animals. Not only that you will also be able to explore many things like China and Europe. and you might even see very historic things. I hope you think about this job.

"When Don came to me and asked me to go to Europe I was glad that is said yes because it's a great adventure that you will never forget. We joined the seagoing cowboys for a reason, it was so we could help out in Europe. When I got to Europe so many diffrent type of countries were riped apart. It was like if there was a huge explosion in a city and it was all gone. People that lived there seem like if they really needed help. We need to help them recover their food suplies, animals, and more.

The day the Pacific war ended we headed for Geece with 388 horeses and hay to feed them all.

When I turned 18 I could have been drafted to military severice but they told me to just keep doing what I was doing. I loved the seagoing cowboys and the trips that we made.

In total I made 16 trips. I think that being a seagoing cowboy is amazing. If you get bord we play talble-tennis,fencing, reading, and writing. I also believe that every one else should try it out and experiance being a seagoing cowboy.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear State Senator,

On behalf of my right of speech to speak, I think the government shouldn't keep the Electoral College. Because it's a process, without the process of picking out who will be the next president of the United States we would be able too choose a right president, we will choose the light for the people of the United States Of America.

The presidential election is held every four years, you help choose your states electors when you vote for your President, because you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidates electors. During the election, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that deals with all the electors to the presidential candidates. After the presidential election, The governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates running for President in your state with name of their respective electors.

The Electoral College is a process dealing with our founding fathers, whoom which they established it in the constitution as a compomise between the elections of voting for the President in Congress or by popular vote. The Electoral College consist of 538 electors, the majority is 270. Under the 23rd Amendment of te Constitution, the District of Columbia has 3 electos and are treated lke state for a purpose of the Electoral College. In following discussion the word ""state"" also refers to the district of Columbia. Nothing is always good tho, there is always a bad side towards everything. Like in the Electoral College system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect for the President. The single argument against the electoral college is what we might call The disaster factor. State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, those electors may always defy the will of the people.

They officially say that the electoral collge is unfair because the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without basis in reality. The arguments against the direct elections are spurious at best. The College is regarded as an anacrinism, a non-democratic metod of selecting a president and to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes is the winner. The College restores some of the weight in the poligtical balance that large states lose by virtue of te mal-apportion of the senate decreed in the constitution. They restore some of the weight in te political balance that large states by population may lose by virtue.

The Electoral College avoids te problm of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the voting cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate wo nas no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they'll have less incentuve to pay attention to he campaign then rather the President being coosen by a popularity of votes.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Would you ever see yourself driving a ''Driverless Car?'' The Driverless Car offers many helpful features to keep drivers safe. A driverless car could make road trips a bit more relaxing for you and your family.The cars have been tested by test dummies no need to worry.

The Driverless car offers many features. One of the manu features the car offers is sensors. Although sensors have been around for many years, they have came back new and improved. The new sensors will alert you when your vehicile is in danger. The car is able to apply the brakes, reduce power from the engine and allow better repsones and control more than any human could. That's not all the car can do! The car can assit in very heavy traffic. Although with all the features of a driverless car, the cars are not completely driverless. For thoe who enjoy driving can turn off these controls and use them only when they are convient.

My opionion on the ""Driverless Car"" is the cars could be very helpful in reducing the number of accidents. Also the car culd make long drives enjoyable and less stressful. The cars might even help save money on gas by being electric or fuel efficient. Lastly the cars could be the next big thing to help make our world more green.

Try the new ''Driverless Car"" you might find many things that help make your everyday driving experiences better. These cars could be the next big thing!",2,3,0,2,0,0,1,0,1
"Reading faces is something very weird that we have discoverd over time and has changed a lot on how you could approach someone or even look at paintings different now. We can also take this very far with all this new technology that we have and the Facial Action Coding Sytstem or (FACS) we will be able to read paintings and facial expressions so much better.

Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdamn with Dr. Huang and his colleague are high experts for computers and trying to find a better way to communicate through facial expressions. This will be very valuable to people in the future such as people that are deaf or have a little bit of not being able to hear.

Reading expressions is how a lot of people tell if somone is angry sad or happy. Reading expressions can help us in a lot of situatiuons and if we can take it to new levels such as looking at paintings or pictures in museums we will be able to go even further after the date that we will collect. Yes reading expressions is valuable to us and this because the more data we have the more farther we can go.

The best way that we have started this is by just everyday facial expressions. The reason people use that and why it is valuable is because the more people use facial expressios more data we will gather to make more epxressions.

So through all of this facial expressions on how far we have come or just using it in everyday life it can either make your first impression or it could help you in a sticky situation. With all the data we have collected and how much we keep collecting from Dr.Huang and his calluege we will take this to bigger heights and be able to read peoples expressions so much more and that's why this is valuable to us a person but as a society.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Snowy days equal blurry camera picture's. With the support of that how could you prove it was made by aliens. As you can see when the picture were taken in December. In December at the North it snow's quit often. Which makes it very hard for a good picture.

On a snow day have you every went outside and looked up. Well its very cloudy. Then your trying to tell me that it was a ancient alien civization. Theres no way we could get a clear picture of what it is on a snowy day. Between the camera distance from mars and the snowy day the only way you could prove that there is aliens their is by going to mars, which has never been done.

The only reason you want this to be true is because NASA would get more moeny for the disoveration of the first ancient civization that we have found. Everyday there is new story lines of ""ancient civization"" saying they have found something like this, but in the end its just a solid rock with no life.

In support snowy days equal blurry camera pictures. This picture is just showing piece of rock that was taken at the right angle at the right time to show a face. Its not about the money its about us knowing the truth, and the truth is its just a boring rock. Anyways wouldnt NASA hide it from us if it really were aliens.",1,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Movies have been fascinated by the idea of cars that drive themselves. We are now closer to making this dream a reality. Google is working on a self driving car as well as other comanies. Self driving cars have many benefits not only to us but to the environment.

Google in 2009 made a car that could drive by itself, but only specific conditions. In the ariticle ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it says that ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far Google cars aren't truly driverless."" Although these cars can drive more than half a million miles

; it can't pull in or out of driveways or deal with taffic issues. It alerts the driver when the driver should take control of the car.

These cars would not only drive themselves and make our safety better, but it also brings benefits for the environment and budget. In paragraph two in the article it says that "" The car he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" If the car uses half the fuel a taxi does then that would be less fuel being burned and damaging our environment. Not only does it help the environment but also our budget. We would not have to pay as much money for fuel as we do for cars we have now.

Although these cars sound amazing there are negative aspects to these cars. These cars can't drive through complicated traffic issues. The car would not be able to deal with traffic issues, go through roadwork or accidents. The car would give the person in the car the control of the car and if that person is not paying attencion then an accident could happen. Some states believe that the only save car is the car driven by a human. A driverless car is a new form of technology and like all technology this could have a maufunction.

Cars that drive themselves sound great and could be really useful in the future, but we must not forget that not everything is perfect. The car provides many benefits like less fuel or engine power. This new car could be a great inovation but also a danger to out safety.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"In the story, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,"" Luke is a boy from a small town and is a cowboy that is almost 18 years old. His friend convenced him to go and help the peolpe across seas that are injured from World War ll. He decided to go and help. When he was on his first trip to go to help he turned 18 and was supposte to go into the army but they said to keep helping, and that would be his serivce time.

Luke has a good idea to help spread the word. He should try to convince people to go and help people that got hurt in World War ll. He should start by telling a lot of people about the Seagoing Cowboys program. lso, he should tell people what they do. Next, he should make posters to show people that the Seagoing Cowboys extict. Then, he should say where they going and how they are seeing all of the different historial places along the way. Finally, he should tell the people what the program offers and how they visit many unique places.

Some reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboy programs are, that you get to take care of animals when you are going across the ocean. Also, you get to help people that need to things that you are bring to them. A lot of things were lost in World War ll. So, you can help give back from the people that we took stuff away from. Also, you see a lot of different cultures. You would get to see the way that people live. Then, when you are over there you can see what the country's culture is. Like, when you are in China you can see all of the stuff that they make over there. You might even see some of the places that were attacked. When you go different place, you get to see different things that you may of never seen before. When you are over seas you can see many interseting things. That is one reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.

Another reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is that once you drop off all of the animals and help the people you have one or two months with open animal cages. On the way back you can play games like, you can wrestle, have table-tennis tournaments, you can fence, and you can box. There are many other game that you could play. So there is another reason that you should join the

Seagoing Cowboys program.

Overall, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program and help out with all kinds of jobs over seas.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Driverless Cars are indeed coming and I think it will change this world for the better. Meaning such cars like these will becomes more and more advanced. The main qualities of this car would be having a much better alert sytem which

will bring down accidents. It is very fuel efficient, and that it will bring up the economy. Driverless cars will change are world for the better.

I don't think cars in the future will ever crash again.Thanks to the new Driverless car, we can stay safe and secure keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. How you ask. With such a car like this it will have sensors that will be more advanced to detect and repond to danger. The information of the sensors will cause the car to apply brakes in the the wheels which will reduce the power of the engine. It could also handle more and more driving tasks on their own. Talk about safety.

One of are most important and main qualities of this car would be that its far more fuel efficient that todays cars/taxies. Do you have any idea what that would do for our country. We would have a much better economy, less waste, less pollution, less affect on the wilderness. Driverless cars could gives us all these things, we just need to put it in action and watch it change are world for the better.

The road to driverless cars are coming with a passion to change the world. We have millions of cars each day creating pollution and climate change ect...

I say that once we have a process of driverless cars taking over, we will becomes very industrialized. This could mean that we won't have as much pollution in Japan or China. We will create more ideas from this idea alone. We could even, in the future, create a sport in which only driverless cars will be in. Driverless cars are not just keeping people safe and secure or having a more fuel efficient car but it will change this world for the better.

The qualities of the Driverless car can give us all this. We are changing the future of not just America, but the world. Maybe even space. I think whoever makes this idea will become richer that Bill Gates. Its a great idea that will give us hope for the world that we live in.

"Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?

The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion.

This technology can be good for some purposes. Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, ""A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor."" This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind.

Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons. If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good. Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation. This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions. Every technology has their flaws though.",1,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is an interesting planet to learn about. The author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because its Earth-like."" However, Venus has a thicker atmosphere than earth. The fahrenheit of Venus is extremely hot. It's possible that any NASA person could visit this planet and understand Venus.

Scientists will figure out a way to travel to Venus and get more information than they already have. For example, somebody from NASA could reach the planet and get to know so much such as; what it looks like and the temperature. They would report back to the boss with every piece of information they've received. The temperature could affect the traveler because its possible to have a heat stroke if they are not careful enough.

The scientists and NASA are being limited by the dangerous travel to Venus. A life could be lost so they are being doubted. Reseachers are not able to research any minerals from Venus unless the rocks, or what not, are brought back to earth by a traveler. Studying Venus is a worthyy pursuit despite the dangers that might come with.",1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Now, is this technology needed in a classroom? It really does not need to be in a classroom, but it can be used for more important task like using it to see other old painting expressions.

For most children in school they all have mixed emotions, and what does seeing how happy they are change anything. Children go to school to learn and get education. Some children are happy to be at school, while some are not happy to be at school. And thoes children already show their expressions. When a child is happy and wants to do work at school, they are the ones to always raise their hands and are bubbley. While the children that are not happy to be at school are usually the ones to not sit right, slouch, and do not raise their hands. Most schools say that they want their students to be happy at school, but with all the work that all children have to do and how they are taught to learn, they do not show the same effect on all children. Some children like things to go one way, while the other children like it the other way, so in that case not all children could be happy at school, unless they were to slit things up to make evey child happy and they still learn the things that they need to learn. In the article, it states,"" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's slime. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions,""(paragraph 7). If our computers at home can not handle the power that is used to detect one of our emotions, how can so many more computers on one software be able to do that. Schools need to spend money on other things like maybe new floors for the gym, or new lockers, what ever it is there are more important things that need to be done before spending money on a computer that can detect wheather we are happy or not.

A way that the Facial Action Coding System can be used in our schools is to see how every child likes the way they learn. Some children can be so comfused in a clas but they never ask for help because they are too embarresed to raise their hand so they hide behind a computer screen and never get the help they need. And if others can see his expressions and notice he needs help they could help out. There are children who need help but are too scared to raise their hands because then they will stand out, and maybe even made fun of. They hide behide a computer screen so people will not know who is confused or needs help. In the article, it states,"" By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece),""(paragraph 8). This states that it can identify if a child is confused, mad and/or sad about their issuse and their communitcation skills. It can help out the adules on the school help out the children of the school. If they had the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, it could help a lot of children come out of their shells and maybe even change in a fantastic way.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System is an amazing thing that can identify people's expressions, it does not really need to be in a classroom, but it can definetly come in handy. Maybe just in the libraray but not in every classroom. They can be very helpful for old paints and seeing those expressions. But there are people out there that put on a fake smile everyday to show others that they are not in pain when they actually are. A lot of people put on an ""act"" for others, meaning that they smile and looks so happy to others, while actually they are hurting and are in pain on the inside. Most people would not notice because they only see what other only show.",3,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Electoral college... what a compromise! the electoral college should be removed and replaced by the popular vote for the president because our votes don't really count and the electors are not always fair.

In the passage it had said ""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for the president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate electors."" This means our votes are not really counting. The state electors are the ones who are actually selecting the president for us. Candidates don't spend time in states that they have no chance of winning. Putting the fate of presidency in the hands of a few swing votes is rediculous. The electoral college is irrational and doesn't show much of reality. Some people tend to lose interest in the president's because of the way they feel about their votes. Thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election and vote directly instead for representitives to do so. People have refused to vote for party candidates and wan't to cast a vote for whomever they please. There are over sixty percent of people that would perfer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Another reason why electoral college should get replaced is because it is not fair sometimes. ""can voters control whom their electors vote for? not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? sometimes."" This is the disater factor, it is hardly expected to reflect on the will of the people. A large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than small states do. At times a presidents can have more popular votes and the other less fewer electoral votes and the one with the popular votes lose and that only happened once. In run off elections if people know that their vote will not have an effect and think its unfair than they have less incentive to pay attention to any compaign than they would if the president were picked by popular votes. Potential voters will turn off the electoral method if they know a candidate has not hope of building up their state.

That is why electoral votes should be replaced with popular votes for the president because most of the time our votes do not count and it is unfair to us.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Some people believe that the Face on Mars is something that was created by aliens. The face was not somethimg created by aliens the face is just a natural landform that is on Mars.If I were a scientist at NASA and i was dicussing the Face on Mars with someone who thinks that the face is something that was created by aliens and i was trying to convince them that it was just a land form i would tell them that if there were really aliens on Mars and NASA found out about it if would benefit them so there would really be no reason to hide it, also I would say that on April 5, 1989 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and Michael Malin captured pictures ten time sharper than the original Viking pivtures and it still showed that it was just a land form and not an alien monument, and last i would tell them that on April 8th Malin's took more pictures of the face when it was a cloudless day on Cydonia using the camera's maximum resolution and Garvin said that if there really was any type of object or anything there that they would be able to see it.

So the first thing i would tell the person that thought that the face was an alien monument is that the scientist at Nasa hope there was some type of life form on mars because they would benefit them so there would be no reason in hiding it. Also in the passage it says that the defenders at NASA budget wish there was an ancient

civilization on mars.

The next thing i would tell them is that on April 5, 1989 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and Michael Malin got pctures that were ten times better that the Viking orginials photos. These photos that were so much better than the orginial photo still proved that the face was just a natural landform.

The last thing i would tell them in that on April 8th,2001 Mars Global Surveyor captured more pictures on a cloudless day on Cydonia and they used the camera's maximum resolution. Garvin said that by using this that if there were really anything on mars that they would be able to see it.

In conclusion what i would say to the person is that one if there were really alien life forms that it would benefit NASA and they wouldnt hide it, next i would tell them that on April 5th they got a picture that was ten times better that the orginial Viking picture and it still shows that its just a landform, lastly i would tell them that Malins team got more pictures of the face and they used the camera's maximum resolution so if there was anything down there they would be able to see it.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Twenty five years ago when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting mars looking for possible landings sights for Viking 2 it spotted a ""face"" on mars in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. NASA revealed the images of this ""face"" thinking that it would be a good way to attract attention to mars. It worked too, maybe not in the way NASA had hoped though. This ""face"" caused many people to belive that it was proof that there is or was life on Mars.

NASA explains this ""face"" formation on Mars as a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Many skeptics believe that this ""face"" is proof of life forms on Mars and that NASA is just trying to cover it up. Although if this was proof of life forms on Mars then that would greatly benefit NASA so why would they try and cover it up? Well the answer is they wouldnt. If there was any proof that there was life forms on Mars then NASA would benefit greatly and they would most likely reveal that to the public as well, not hide it.

So what is this ""Face of mars"" that has had so many people questioning NASA and skepticizing over whether or not there is life on Mars? Well, the latest picture was an MGS image from 2001. This image shows the ""Face"" for what it actually is, which is a mesa. As it says in the article Unmasking the Face on Mars ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

This lattest image has been able to show us what the rock land form on Mars actually is. Which is just a mesa. Slowly since the image from the NASA Viking 1 in 1976 we have been getting better and better quality images. With these better quality images we are able to see that this rock land form on Mars doesnt even really look like a face. Slowly the pictures have gotten less hazy and we have been able to better see the ""face.""

When you look back on that first image, the one from the Viking 1space ship in 1976 its easy to say that the land from on Mars looks like a face. Because it does look like a face in that first bad quality image, but now that we have new technology with better photo taking abilities it is easy to see that what we once may have thought looked like a face. Is just a mesa on Mars. Not proof that there is aliens, or other life forms on Mars. Just a Mesa, that in all reality doesnt actually look all that much like a face.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Wow! Technology is really going far. New computer software that can recognize six basic emotions, such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The latest innovation from prof. 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model moves like human muscels. FACS (Facial Action Coding System), Imagine how much this could help you out.....

The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because this could help for many reasons. As it says in the article ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" If a computer knows when you're happy or sad that means it could help you out. For example say your sad when you log-in to your computer,the computer can post happy adds or funny things can just pop up to make you feel better.

A computer that can make you happy when your sad, it's like having a pet or a bestfriend. It's like it knows your personality and your feelings. For example if your getting frusrated while taking a test, the computer will help you out by posting happy things to get you back on task. It knows your emotions which means it knows what will and what won't help you.

This would really be nice for those who gets angry quick, or gets frustrated while doing work on a computer. Even while using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements.

This computer could be used for breaks, like if your in class having a hard time. The teacher could say ""have some time on your computer."" When you log-in it'll already know your emotions so it'll help you get back on track. It could post anything just to get you smiling and ready to work again. This would be helpful for alot of students.

Computer software that can recognize six basic emotions, such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust and sadness. Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscels. The latest innovation from prof. 3-D computer model of the face ;all 44 major muscels in the model moves like human muscels. FACS (Facial Action Coding System), Recognizes when a student is becoming confused or bored, can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, tracks emotions. I think this would be very valuable for everyone not just students. IT's alot of people that needs things like this to get through the day.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The Facial Action Coding Sytem is not valuable in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students.

In the beginning of the the introduction say, ""New sofware has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" I say this because techology can make mistskes such as a computer that can read your emotions through your face and can have an accurate result. For example you might think an person who is happy by showing a smile but is the person really happy behind that smile with hidden emotions. It's not only one person there are others too who hide their emotions.

In paragraph 5 says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actuallly describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convry specific emotions."" I can somewhat agree because he is right about the fact that it's hard describing a facial expreesion that includes surprised or sad.

This shows that we dont need this type technology to show other people how we feel if they accurate.",2,3,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Traveling outside of our planet ,we call Earth, seems bizarre. Unless NASA sends a couple astronauts out to the moon, traveling to any other planet is not something a person would be used to hearing everyday. Imagine going to a planet where it is surrounded by a carbon dioxide atmosphere and a corrosive sulfuric acid atmosphere combined. While it only gets up to a little over 100 degrees in many places aorund the world in the summer, this planet gets over 800 degreees Fahrenheit year round. Obviously, it seems impossible to live there without dying immediately. But, isn't that why we have spacecrafts to go off and do missions? Many spacecrafts only make it a few hours when sent to this planet, making it nearly impossible. Surprisingly enough, this planet is known as Venus. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density, size and distance, which makes sense why so many scientists and employees at NASA are so interested in studying Venus.

Venus is known as Earth's sister planet. Earth being very similar to Venus, Venus is extremely different in ways it is hard for a human being to imagine. But, once upon a time, Venus was more Earth-like than ever before. It was covered in large oceans with a suitable way for forms of life to live there. Today, Venus has some similarities, such as a surface of rocky sediment and has valleys, mountains, and craters. Being so similar to Earth, scientists decided to take up on diving deeper in the world of Venus. Venus has an incredible amount of dnager, which is why NASA has options for making the mission safe but also scientifically productive.

One of several options would be to send humans to study Venus floating above the fray. With this option, the humans would be able to survive, but still have to go through 170 degree temperatures. An obvious disadvantage to floating above the fray would be the distance barrier. It is very hard to collect samples of rock, gas, or photos from that far of a distance. Rendering standard forms of photograph and videography become ineffective because floating from such a distance provides limited insight.

The right but more difficult path to take would be figuring out a way to reach ground level on Venus. Not impossible, researchers are working on innovations that would let the machines last long enough to contribute meaningfully to get more knowledge on Venus. Some of the simplified electronics are made of silicon carbid and have also been tested in some of the extreme dangers that Venus has. A second similar machine would have been similar to mechanical computers used base in the 1940s during World War II. These type of devices make calculations by using gears and levers without the need of electronics. Today's modern technology would be fragile to be able to sustain any type of conditions in Venus, although it is way easier and faster to use modern day technology for this specific challenge.

Having danger limit the human brain is one of the ""easier said than done"" situations. After a while, humans will become to curious and will want to know more about Venus and about all of the dangers that come with it. There is no other way to figure these things out other than figuring out a way to see all of it for ourselves. Using our curiousity, researchers and those who work at NASA might be able to create new innovations or ways to see all of the dangers that are within the scary planet of Venus.",3,2,1,3,1,2,2,3,2
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, but he does not support his idea that well. The author mostley stated the bad things about studying Venus and very few positive things.

The author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". This statement supports his idea but not good enough. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" says the author. I love this comment, but he does not eplain why he thinks this.

When I read this I disagree with the author because he puts a lot of negative information into

the aticle. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" this tells us that if we wee to try this mission again we wouldn't survive, and if you add on ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" this is telling us we would not be able to handle it because we have never incountered such temperatures and and dangerouse acids.

The author of ""Challenge of Exploring Venus"" should have put more positive information into his article rather than putting a lot of negativity. The author's article was detailed and provided a lot of information, but not enough to back up his suggestion to study Venus.",2,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,2
"Having ""electors"" vote for us from the electoral college is basically giving us, the people, no say into what we president we want. Why ask us the people to vote when you have someone or others to chose what they think we want for president? Changing the from electoral college voting to the popular vote can give us the people a voice for what we want and think is best for this country and it gives us a reason to vote. If we still electoral college voting then our voice as a country is not being heard.

Giving us a voice in this country that we live in an enormous oppurtunity than what other countries around the world do not have the privelage to have. Giving us, the people, a voice brings us together as a country and it unifies us. It also means that not only do we have governent power but we have people power as a whole. Bradford Plumer from source 2 explains to us in his first subtitle what is wrong withe the electoral college and he startes that ""When you vote, you are not voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors, who then for the president of their choice."" That was an example of our people not having a voice because we are basically wasting our time voting because at the end of the day the slate of electors are the ones who end up chosing who they want as president. Why should we vote when our vote doesn't even matter?

Moreover, I feel that us voting is a waste of our time because of this winner-takes-all method that Bradford Plumer states in the fifth paragraph of his article titled: The Indefensible Electoral College. The winner-takes-all method is when presidents travel to specific states in which they believe they would win in the electoral votes and some states do not get visited at all by neither of the canidates because the canidates do not feel like they would win their votes. I understand that the electoral college is a process in which was founded by our founding fathers and established it into our constitution so that there is a compromise between election of the presodent by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens (Source 1). It is not really a compromise when you have a system in which a president can win the popular vote by 99 percent of the people but still lose by the electoral college because we basically have no say in the election.

On a final note, the electoral college system is a unfair way of our countries presidents to be elected when we also have the votes of the people which have no effect on which canidate wins. Although, our founding fathers thought this was a terrific idea at the time of making this part of the constitution, in reality we have a much larger population today than they did in the past when they had made the constitution. Having have all these people in our country vote today for a canidate and later have the vote not take any effect which canidate should win is very unfair. I can understand the electoral college system working back then when it was first made because the population was still relatively minimal but now we must abolish it because the points that some electoral vote colleges get is very small compared to some other states. How would you feel if you were a canidate and got 99.9 percent of the votes and still lost?",4,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
I think that it is good that smart cars are being made because say if someone is paying attention to the road and doing something with there child like giving there baby a toy or something and there eyes are off the road then nothing is there to help stop the car. A smart car is a good thing to have because it will most likely lower the amount of crashes that happen even year and even drop the death rate per year. So i think smart cars are a good idea because say if your having a hard time parking your car then the car can do it for you? If someone is drinking and driving or texting and driving then that car can save someones from causing a death or injury. another reason is that the businesses that are making the smart cars are getting extra money for making these car so they can have extra money to add better advances to there car and it will be safer for teen to drive and for younger kids that are in the back seat enjoying there time and they can be safe and enjoy there time.The main resson i am saying all of theses thing is that i want are cars to be more safer so that we want have to worry that much about are family members getting into crashes because they were paying that much attention to the road and they didn't have anything to help them from preventing them from crashing or even the kids in the back of the car can just sit back and just have a wonderful time enjoying there lifewhy they are in the car.That is why i think making driveless cars are very important in the world today.,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Car use can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it, but most of the time people have strong opinions on car use.

Ask anyone if they want to walk 10 miles in the freezing cold weather and a large amount of them would tell you no. Rarely anyone nowadays appreciates the importance of gas consumption, global warming, polution and other situatons that happen when cars are used to often or frequently but that never seemed like a problem did it?

Riding bikes or walking of course will save you all of the trouble of having to fill up you're car or pollutting the air and so forth but i feel that it will also be an important insight to appriciate everything before it's gone.

Meaning that if you have a car, you automatically think that will make evrything easier which in some cases it will but in life, we always ahve to go through things that are hard to get us to soemthing better.

Getting to the point of why material possessions can sometimes cause people to think that we can't live without certain things is a lesson as to why nobody really ""needs"" anything and that goes for transportation purposes as well.

We all come into this world with nothing, and we leave this world with nothing and if no one can be happy without material possessions then i feel that we havent learned a very valuable lesson that used to be here when nothing stopped us from walking to a friends house to say hello or to simply send a letter in the mail if you wanted to talk to someone. The use of technology and updated versions of things have changed our world completely and no matter what way you look at it, there will always be an opinion that is different from you're own.

Limiting car use may be useful to others who feel like they want to relieve stress or just want a sense of contentment as they walk down the street and take in thier surroundings instead of worrying about you're mirrors and the annoying person behind you honking thier horn for you to move quicker. And concluding if we took the time to really think and take in our surroundings we realize that this world has become complex but there are many ways to fix it. Transporation has just made it a little easier.",1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

"To some people the limit of car use is very important to them, because they want to stop pollution or things. In the city of Vauban, Germany they do not use cars because, to start off with to even park a car you would have to pay $40,000 plus the price of your house to be able to park it at a parking garage. The city has worked for two decades to make Vauban, Germany better for walking. Which made Vauban home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile. This made people all around the world consider to reduce car use, in America the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities.

Other countries strictly rely on car reducing to take down the amount of polltuion in the air. Paris days after a near-record pollution forced car reduction to everyone. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, and many had their cars impounded. People in the capital city of France were starting to get sick and get congestion because of all of the smog, and pollution from cars. For Paris to have car reduction they had to ban any cars with odd numbered license plates from driving for a certain period of time. After all of the pollution in the air had cleared enough they had a party for the people with odd numbered license plates to drive again.

In another occasion of car reduction Bogota, columbia had a car reduced day where people would hike, bike, skate, and take buses to work. They as well used this chance to clear pollution of the air and some people didn't mind it, they had a chance of a stress free day and the ability to lower air population. Any violators who chose to drive a car would be issued a $25 fine. Other countries who did not have car reduced days liked the idea of it, and thought they were generating a ""revelutionary change"". Due to these car reduced days parks and sports centers have been an uprise. The days without cars is a campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s.

In the United States of America government officials have talked about car reducing, but have never passed it. In 2005 the miles driven in America had peaked, and dropped steadily after. Michael Sivak said, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"". Bill Ford owner of For Motor proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.",2,3,3,3,1,1,2,1,2
"Is using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom the right thing to do? What does this type of technology help other students on? Can it help people comunicate with others in the world? Is forcing a fake smile a good thing or bad.

First, using the ""Facial Action Coding System"" to read students emotions during class is good because it can let the teacher know how they feel. For an example, if a student was taking a test or a quiz online and was slacking off or getting tired, the computer would switch the questions up until they find the right questions to ask when the student face expression chamges. While doing that, it helps them stay on track and not get bored that easily. The system recognize emotion by the every muscles on your face. This new envention even figured out how Mona Liza was feeling by just technology.

Next, can it help comunicate better in the real life world? By using this new Facial Action Coding System, Students can now study what kind of emotions are shown when talking to other people. What I trying to say is that, they can find out when they are fake smiling,laughing, or even interested in the conversation. One example on fake smiling is that is you can see the bottom and upper teeth at the same time, they are really not smiling but just smiling to not make anything wierd. If someone that you are taking with is not interested on the topic guys are talking about, you can notice by simpily looking into their eyes and if they are just looking anywhere besides making eye contact, they are not even paying attention to you.

Finally, making a fake smile, is that a good thing? According to the Facial Feedback, moving your face muscles to smiling not only expresses emotions, but they also helps your facial muscles produce them. By even smiling actually makes you happy. To me, being happy is the best, why not to other people. A drama coach by the name of Constantin Stanislavsky, made mostly all his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning to create their emotions on stage. Feeling someone else's emotion stage may happen because we are not used to seeing that.

By using technology to see how stuents are, is that the good thing to do or bad? Does this type of technology help students. Can the Facial Action Coding System help people comunicate with others in the world? Can fake smiling help people around the world?",2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Driverless cars were once just a concept, however with growing technology this concept is becoming a reality. The ideas of completely autonomous cars could never be fulfilled because of the lack of technology in the past. Today, our technology has grown with the development of various gadgets that could aid in the introduction of autonomous cars to the world.

I believe the idea of driverless cars can become a reality and I am not opposed to it. However, there are issues that need to be ironed out before this idea can become a reality. First of all, the prices of these cars may not be very low, in fact, they most likely will be extremely expensive due to all of the technology being applied to the vehicles. In accordance with these high prices, the amount of consumers purchasing these cars may be very little. If there is a small amount of people in driverless cars, this means that there is a large amount of people driving themselves. This introduces the question of human error. Although the idea seems ideal, you have to put into account the fact that there will be human and driverless car interaction on the roads. The question I prompt is whether these cars will be able to handle situations in which there is human error. If the developers of this product can think of a way to prevent encounters of human error, I would fully support their ideas.

The idea of driverless cars is a reality that I think should come true, under the circumstances that they are completely safe. Currently these cars require a small amount of human action, for example the cars require someone to control them when driving in conditions that need more maneuvering than the car can handle on its own. If the cars can become completely autonomous, perhaps they can be an invention that could solve a plethora of problems. For example, traffic. These cars could greatly reduce commutes to people's jobs or schools and much more. The reasoning behind this is that traffic is almost always due to accidents occurring in busy areas. These cars can reduce the amount of human error on the roads by reducing the amount of humans driving on the roads. These cars could increase the safety of everyone on the road. In addition to safety, drivers hand would be open much more often allowing them to be productive on their commutes, however, if complete autonomy is not achievable, drivers must remain focused on the roads at all times.

The article suggests that these cars could reduce the amount of gas being consumed suggesting a way for consumers to save money over time, adding to the list of pros autonomous cars can provide.

Although the idea of autonomous cars seems far fetched, it is actually in the near future. Perhaps one day the whole world will be operating on driverless cars. Today, there are cars that are extremely close to driving completely on their own, imagine in the future when these cars are able to achieve complete autonomy. This future you are imagining is not that far away, in fact, it is almost here.",3,3,0,3,2,3,3,3,3
"People chattering as they walk down the payment, buzzing conversation on who will win the coming election. Large bulleton board's towlering above the city streets and towns a smiling face firmly drawn on them with the caption, ""Vote for me for President."" Television's fills with compains and speeches.  How is it we come to the conclusion of voting a president? and which way do I favor? Among our rapidly growing population and country every 4 year's ""we the people "" cast in our vote for president and who might I ask count those votes? The electoral college, which some think it's a place but acually it's a long process to chosing our next president. The electoral college consists of electors, there meeting is where they voe for he president and also vice president by counting the electoral votes by congress. When you vote for president you are really choosing your candidate and actually voting for your candidate's electors. I strongly disagree with this mythed because I favor more that the president chose be chosen by popular vote  not by electors we chose.

What's wrong with the electoral colledge? You run into multiple issues with the electoral college as you slowly go into it's process and how the president is chosen. One big issuse is the Disaster factor. Considering that state legislatures are technially responsiable for picking electors. If we chose the president by popular vote like we should, it would be more resonable because it's a way so that the people of our country are happy. The eclectoral college is unfair to voter's also.  With the ""Winner takes all"", system is each state candidates don't even spend time in states they know have no chance is winning, there only focus is on the swing states and the ones who have a more lickly chance of winner with there voter! This is highly unfair to the people! Our votes should count more then what electors chose. This is our nation, our country, our home and we should get to decide on who will lead it in a fair way, electors should count all the votes and then chose  the president by popularity and better man.

The elector collegde is said to be a non-democratic method to be overruled by declaring the most popular votes for the candiate the winner. When your voting you acually voting for the slate of electors who will chose the president and vice president.

Chosing our president should be up to popular vote, electing electors who will chose the president is a unfair priocess and the electoral college is very out dated and it's system and ways should be over thought about. Counting our votes on president and chosing the president by popluar vote is the best way to go. Firstly it allows for the president most wanted to become president. Second it's a easier process then having to vote for a elector, wait for there votes, and then wait for there decesion on president. Think about it? We the people, should chose our president souly on poplation votes.

To conclude, the electoral college is a unfair, outdated, and irrational way to chose our presendent. We the people should be able to chose the present by poplar vote not only because it's our chose on who should lead are country but also it's a easier and better way to chose our president. I highly agree that we should be able to chose our next president by poplar vote and rething the electoral college.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Although limiting car usage may seem out of the ordinary, it has many benefits that appeal to people. By limiting car usage, people save money, the air isn't being poluted as much and there aren't as many traffic jams.

For starters, not having or using a vehicle is a huge money saver. For example, a German suburb, Freiburg, near French and Swiss borders allow the use of cars, but is somewhat strict. Rosenthal states, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" Not only does it cost $40,000 just for that but gas and fix-ups go along with having a car.

Secondly, the less people use vehicles, the less air pollution is going to be created. For instance, Paris issued a driving ban in an effort to ""clear the air of the global city."" Duffer says, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The smog that affects Paris is also known to ""rival"" with Bejing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world. By banning car usage for a day, the air had a chance to breathe and is overall healthier for the people that live in that area.

Lastly, it's obvious to say that with less car usage, the more likely it is to have a decrease in number of traffic jams. To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" It's a positive thing to have ""car-free day"" because less accidents mean less people getting injured.

To conclude, limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing.",3,4,3,4,2,2,2,2,3
"Dear Mr. Senator,

My name is Jacob and I would like to discuss with you some of the problems with the way the presidential election works. I believe the system using the Electoral College is unfair and can have its negative outcomes. In my opinion, the President should be chosen through the popular vote. There have been several times to date where presidents have one the popular vote but still lost the election due to the Electoral college. Often the President will have won by both Electoral votes and the popular votes but that isnt always the case. The electoral which has 538 electors are people as well. What is to stop them from voting who they want and not what the popular vote says in that state? They are people that are put in a position of power to choose who the next president will be. The obvious choice would be for them to pick who they want as president. Voters may also get confused about how the system works. They may thinkn that their vote doesnt count, that only the electors votes count. I believe that using a system where the popular vote is what chooses the election. This can solve several problems such as confusion and biased electors. If people felt that their vote counted, they might even want to get more involved.

Sincerely,

Jacob",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,2
"I think that the new technology ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a great idea to use in the classroom. The new techology is perfect for teachers to use because it could give the teacher some insite on how the student is feeling, Lost, Confused, Distressed, Bored, Ect. Those are the main resons people do not learn much about what the presentation or lecture is about.

In the passage it states the teacher will be able to see if a student is confused. If the student is the teacher would be able to stop the lecture and ask some questions. Even if they are not saying anything about their confusion the teacher could ask them after class and save them from loosing a day of notes just by being confused. This new technology not only could save students from bad grades in class but it could tell the teacher how the student is feeling or even thinking.

If the student shows and emotion on his face like depression or anger the teacher would know and could ask that student what is wrong. The teacher would be able to comfort that student or even help he/she through that rough time in their life. The student could have just lost a loved one or got into a fight with a close friend so they may be only thinking about that and not about their classwork. Teacher could tell that students parents about what is wrong and their parents could comfort their child as well.

The Facial Coding System could you used worldwide around schools from elementary all the way through college.

This technology could help many schools that are big and many kids in one classroom. With this technology the teacher would even be able to know if the student has a question. This could primarily help many students with their grades. I know that when I get confused I do not stop the teacher to ask the question, I wait until the end of class and forget that I had a question. The teacher would know this and I would get that question answered either during the lecture or after class. That is why I think that this new technology is revelutionary.

That mans name was Luke Bomberger.

Luke bomberger had a friend who helped him out, sugesting seagoing cowboys to him. That is when it all begin for Luke bomberger.

Lukes friend asked him to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Luke said he could not turn down that opportunity.

It could start Lukes whole currire just to go to Europe.

It did start Lukes currire.

It started him becomeing a seagoing cowboy.

Luke bomberger and his friend road down on the cattle-boat.

""The cattle-boat trip was unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy,"" he says.

Luke toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

It took a little while to cross the Atlantic Ocean from eastern cost of United States and a month to get to China.

Luke was busey because of the aniamls during the cossing.

The animals had to be fed two or three times a day.

Luke bomberger found something just by a friend asking him to come with.

Do not let a huge opportunity go down the dran just because you don't want to.

So what are you going to do when somebody gives you a opportunity.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. This would be a gret way of futher advancing techology by starting this on the students in the classroom. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. With this technology being able to read the emotionjs of the student, the it could be able to modify the lesson to further intrest the student. A computer that knows when youre happy, suprised, angry, disgusted, scared and sad sounds pretty cool, right? Most people would say so, this advancement in technology is amazing, but people may not be able to afford it. This would be great in classrooms because most teacher dont know that a child does not get the subject if the child does not say anything about it. With this technology we can help the children learn better and easier in the classroom.",1,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Could this be a total fail? Should we be able to let schools use this device? Could the machine be a waist of time? Should the info provided by the machine lead to somting bigger than just emotions? This divce could either help people or desroy people in its own way: or it could also be a complete fail.

The use of this device in class rooms would be great in a way;so the teachers could see whats going on with one of there students. On a total other note not every one can express there feelings through facial expresions; even some people tend to portray others emotional states wich leads to imataion. So personally I would not want to have this at my school. For there will be a complete disaster (people can always fake ).

In the text the writer was talking about ""empathy (the feeling of someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate other persons facial expreions'(found in paragraph 9).Another example from the text would be we dont neccacerly need a machine to predict others emotuions. In the text it stated that to an expert faces dont lie ;that muscles are a clue .Also that a false smile can be predicted by the facial mucles: in the text it stated that ""the mouth is stretched side ways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risourius"".

In conclusion the machine would not be valuable in a class room. There are many other things to focus on/in class that using the machine would be a complete waist of time. A way students could be checked on instead is by communicting with them or directing them in the correct direction.",1,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"the use of a car limit using can help in different  ways as it could help us save the planet from a greenhouse effect or improve safty as it woul be a lower chance to get into a car crash with can result in injury or death but with limit usage it would make the wourld a better place and here to explain why limit usage is good.

in the story its says that as the population grows more in american they has to be a production in cars to help the person to get to one place to another. but however in january 1995 many americans were cash-strapped due to the decrease in driving along with the unemployed wasnt going to work aanyways as they try to recover underway. in another story it tells how people could live without cars but in germany as one of the family said ""when i had a car i was always tense and im happier this way. As studys show that 70% of familes do not own cars but as well are happy just by walking or riding a bike beacuse cars make up the greenhouse gas. While in the vauban homes are being adopted in order to provide transportation with less spaced parking then walking all of the way to the mall. in america the agency of environmental are staring to promote and also want a ""car reduced"" area where they can help perserve the wild life as 80% of the law has gone to the highway and the other 20% is the transport its self. In other places they have a car-free day which means no cars or transport will be used through out the day as many people would take a bike or walk or even hike as one person said ""its a good opportunity to take away stress along the pollution in the air"" as it shows that there should be a limited usage of cars. As this could impact the world along with the enviorment around it.

the care usage limited idea is good because it helps people support the enviorment along with decreasing greenhouse gas and smog as people will either take a bike or walk to get from place to place without having the traffic jam struggle.",1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The machine by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe is very helpful in the classroom in many ways, as the article helps explain. It can help to determine what lesson plans are working for the students and what lesson plans are not working as well. Also, it can help how another student is feeling about something non-school related.

The machine, as said in the text, uses the 44 major muscles to understand how a student or any other person is feeling. An example is when it says in paragraph 6 that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is significant because this can tell if a student fully understand what the teacher is teaching and if he or she is learning. Also, it can tell what kind of lessons or lesson plans the students will react to the most.

Another way the machine is significant is because if a student is getting bullied or getting made fun of. The machine will know and that can further help and get the help the student needs without saying anything. This could prevent stuff going too far and prevent further cases of this type of thing happening.

In conclusion, there is many ways the machine by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe can be a significance for students and teachers in the classroom. Two of those examples are to understand how to make a lesson plan work for the students and also to help students that aren't showing that they need help in school or out of school.",2,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,2
"The way I think about this articale is that I dont think that it will be a good idea for use. because what if you where puting on a face. If we put this technology into are computers it would mess with people that look like they are struguling for a person that is just boted and does not want to do it. So they would wast there time if it would go throw a deminstration about how to do it. Even if was a thing that was just for your computer it would not be fun. Do to the fact that it mite mess with what you are trying to do.

One the part with people puting on a face what if you where smiling but was acutually sad just for the fact that you had to. Many times when you see a picture it may look like he/she are acting like that but are actualy not so it could through it off and mabey get you confused on the way.

On the other hand it could help you like if some one was thinking of some thing and you could not help them or dont know if to do somthing or not. Mabey you could make it into something small like a app on a phone. People would use it to have fun with while walking or try to make it a game among friends that are around you and see if you can tell one anothers expreshons.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"yes i think it is good to have a emotion machine for students in school it cold possily help them and people around them to figure out what is going on are when they need to take a break are upset about something i think it would be useful in the long run. paragraph 6. the same technology can male computer-animated-faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. most human communication is non-verbal, including emotional communication. and it also is devolping a new way for humans to communicate but i think we should just be open and just be able to express yourself on your own its easy.

but it would be really nice to see a computer that can read emotions in school like i said it can help kids learn better and help teachers know what they are doing wrong or when they need bathroom breaks or a snack time. and in the long wrong it could help students become more succsesful and have alot more knowlodage as well. it could also become a distraction as well in a class room because the students maybe just want to abuse the computer when they are souposed to be doing there work intsted of trying to figure out peoples emotions. it is also really cool that the computer can read if you got a fake smile. and how they tell is the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and diffrient muscle, the risorius,to an expert, faces dont lie these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politaction ot celebirty is not being truthful at all.

"The author suggests that studying Venus is important for a few reasons. The first of which is that Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes. The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus. What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well. That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus.

The first of which that the author brings up is the fact that Venus is the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earth's. It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earth's and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans. This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants. Another thing that was brought up was in paragraph three where the author talked about how Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes this is something that we also share with that is also happening here on Earth. If we could go to Venus and study all of that it could help us understand how to know farther ahead of time when we may have a a earthquake. The final thing that the author talks about is all of the challenges that we will face trying to get humans on the ground on Venus. The troubles that we face is the atmosphere and the pressure. These challenges make it almost impossibe for humans to withstand becase the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So what the author is getting at is that if we are able to get through all of these challenges and get boots on the ground on Venus, it would mean that when we are to explore or study another planet we can overcome these challenges much faster.

So that is why I think that the author wants us to explore Venus. The first reason being Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. The second one being that Venus was once able to be compatable for life. Third is that Venus experiences earthquakes and lightning striks just like Earth does. Finally the last thing that the author brings up is that going to Venus could help us travel to other planets with knowledge on how we can overcome the challenges from Venus. That is why I think that the author wants NASA to study Venus farther and learn more about it.",3,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Dear Senator,

In the year 2000, a great injustice was made in our country.  The president who the people voted for was unfairly defeated because of the electoral college.  Our government says that it is by the people and for the people, but the electoral college is against this whole ideal.  The electoral college is unfair, undemocratic, and outdated.

To begin with, the electoral college is unfair because we aren't actually voting for the president, which is a constitutional right.  We are voting for a group of people, who by human nature, have their own opinions and agendas.  It is quite possible that they would go against us and vote differently like the 2000 election.

In addition, the electoral college is not democratic.  The people, who are supposed to decide who becomes president, are in fact, not deciding at all.  The voters are a piece of unnecessary government.  The popular vote should always be the way presidents are chosen according to the constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

Finally, the electoral college is a very outdated idea.  Maybe, in our country's beginning when people didn't have media or fast-traveling news, it may have been a good idea to have informed voters, but now, everyone has the chance to be informed.  Our country doesn't need an electoral college because we can think for ourselves.

Thank you,

"At a glace, ""The Face of Mars"" could be misunderstood as an alien artifact. The Scientists at NASA are more than sure it is nothing but a rock formation, an illusion caused by the the shadows it causes. The picture still bacame an icon over its false label however. For two and a half decades, people believed there were aliens outside of the atmosphere placing these on planets. It wasn't until a more clear camera came around that

the face really was shown.

To the dismay of many conspiracy theorists, the face is nothing more than a mesa. As Jim Gavin, cheief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program calls it reminds him most of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Not only are these rock formations common on Mars barren landscape, but also the living, breathing planet that is our home. Mesas are highly common on earth-this one on Mars just so happens to look like the face of a person.With all of the media attention it recieved, the article even says ""defenders of the NASA budgetwish there was an ancient civilation on Mars."" We can infer that NASA's findings were not that of aliens, as though they currently do not have the funds for space exploration projects,

With people unsatisfied of NASA saying it was just an odd formation of rocks, NASA took pictures of it on April 5, 1998, and again on April 8, 2001. As the images becaome sharper and shaper over time, it looks less and less like a human head. With the better pixels, people could see that it was just as NASA made it out to be- a mesa. With this picture, many theories around the face were not as credible.

Some might say that it still might be from an alien. even so, it seems like something you would see on our world that scientists could prove naturally. The rock formation being common on Earth, and multiple pictures across 25 years is sufficent enough to be proven false.NASA also mentions that the main reaon for the rocks looking as they are are from the strange shadows over it, giving the illusion of a face. The main reason for all the attention it got was simply because ofa trick of the eye. NASA also includes that clouds on the surface could be another reaon it looks as such.

Keeping these things in mind, it's safe to say that the face people see is just a natural part of Mars. The same natural formation can be found around our world .The reason people believed it to be something more was because a poor quality camera by today's standards. Since the, we can better understand how it looks. What would it look like with a camera today?",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Exploring Venus would not be an easy task, as mentioned by the author of this article, but the author believes that studing Venus is worth the dangers it presents. The author lists some reasons for studying the planet and many reasons why it would be dificult.

Venus is a very forboding place that is not kind to the human race. The author lists some reasons why Venus is hard to study, such as: the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are of corrosive sulfric acid. The carbon dioxide atmosphere makes the pressure put on the surface 90 times greater than what is on Earth. The sulfric acid can eat throught many metals over time and will constantly erode anything we send there. The surface tempature of Venus is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is hot enough to melt tin.

The author also give some reasons why we should try to visit Venus. One is that Venus may have been like earth long ago. Venus once had large liquid oceans that could of supported life forms, and it has many geological similarities to Earth such as the surface being rocky, sediment buiding up, mountians, and creaters. Venus is also the closest planet at times and could be crucial to space travel as a stop along the way.

Many new technologies would come from trying to visit Venus. Some listed by the author are simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide, these components have been able to survive for three weeks in similar conditions to the surface of Venus. Another technology would be bringing back mechanical computers used in World War II and repourpose, and advance them. Mechanical computers may last longer int he harsh conditions, but lack the speed needed for complex computations.

The author gives several reasons why trying to study Venus would be benifical and backs up their claims with sufficent evidence. The author also gives several counter claims to let readers see the other side of the debate and lets them choose. Technology is another thing listed that dosn't have a whole lot to do with the debate but is more of a positive by product, so that could also be a reason why we should visit. Overall the author does a exceptional job in argurig why we should try to study Venus even if it is difficult, the human race will prosper.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"I am Cristal, and well the idea of smart cars is pretty awesome, I am aware of the ""Driverless cars,"" malfunctions and the defects it has. I believe that it is a great idea and should be inforced. The car has many great features that can help us be safe and have lower fuel prices. We could make the future better and safer. Even though the price of the car,and the road work that needs to be adjusted will be expensive but will be totally worth it.

First of all, i agree with the making of the car. It is a great invention for the future. It has good perks of course such as, not driving, being quite safe, being able to text without driving,and it also would reduce the fuel of a normal taxi cab to about one half. The smart cars have"" driven more than half million miles without a crash,"" this is saying that the cars have driven far without causing any accidents. Secondly the cars have"" position-estimating senors, GPS receivers, radar sensors, motion sensors, 3-D model of the cars surroundings."" All of these things that the car has are more than enough to be great on roads.

The good thing is that the smart car would be able to take you anywhere you desire. I think it would be a great idea if your a begining learner and dont have that much expiernce and or if you are under the influence of alcohol. It is a good car for thoes who like to text while they drive you will finally be able to text without killing yourself or getting pulled over by the police. You will be able to return home or to your destination safely. It uses less fuel which is great we wont use all of it and have to raise prices on fuel if we use less. The car will be pricey and all of the new work that would have to be done to the roads all over the world or country. But dont you think that your life would be more safe if your not in conditions to drive then isnt car is the best idea?

In conclustion, i cristal believe that it would be a great invention for the future. You will be safe getting to your destination. Its great for the economy of the people, and its safer than one driving. It will be expensive but in the end it will all be worth the price it took to make the car and to do all hard work on the roads to make the world a better place. Our life is in great hands will the smart cars that will soon do a great job taking us places.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The ""face"" on Mars is indeed a natural landform. The ""face"" could have been formed by multiple things. Such as being hit by other rocks, or it may even be the formation of some kind of sand. A lava dome could be another option of what it is. The picture is sharp enough to catch any living evidence. The article states, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times biggerthan the pixel size,"" (NASA, 12). What they are stating here is that if some kind of living evidence was in the picture they would be able to recognize it instantly.

A so called ""face"" formation on mars, even showed up as a natural landform. as stated in the text,

""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (NASA, 7). What they are stating in that paragraph is that it may have looked like a alien monument but it was never a ""alien monument"", it was just a natural landform. That which could have been made by many different occasions that may have happen. Scientist are always searching for more and more explanations everyday.

If there was any objects in the first picture taken, any sciencetist or any citizen could have noticed the picture was sharp enough to pinpoint any living evidence or so called ""aliens"". Even if there was transportation such as cars airplanes or any shelter as known as ""Egyptian-Style Pyramids"" or even ""Small Shacks"", you would have been able to make out an tell what the objects are. As started from the text ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"" (NASA, 12)!

The so called ""face"" on the planet ""Cydonia"" could have been formed by lava and may even be a ""lava dome"". Yeah some people qont always agree with the evidence, but you have to look at the facts. You also might not agree there is lava on the planet Cydonia but honestly tell me have you ever been to Cydonia to prove to me 100%, aliens made the monument and its not a natural landform? once you show me that proof ill take another look and maybe turn my point of veiw from your side. Until then ill believe its a lava dome or some kind of natural resource. As stated in ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""What the picture actually shows is the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,""says garvin"" (NASA,12) what they are saying is the ""face"" is a natural landform which they can compare to many different landform and monuments on earth.

NASA can compare the so called ""face on the red planet"" to many different things on earth. They can compare height, shape, color, texture, etc. as stated in ""unmasking the face on mars"", ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars""(NASA, 12) In that evidence from the text they are saying they can take the height and compare it to the Face on Mars and it will be almost exactly the same. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, not every person in the world may agree but if you look at the facts and evidence together you will be able to comprehend the ""Face"" is not an aliens monument, it is a natural landform.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Imagine a woman is late to work and her hair is a mess, she threw random clothees on, and all her work papers are stored in random places in her briefcase. But if she owns a driverless car, the woman could sort out her paper files, fix her hair, and be safe at the same time. Having a driverless car has a positive outlook on itself and the future by providing safety for the drivers that own these driverless cars.

A driveless car has a positive outlook for itself by providing safety features too. In passage 8, it states ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This statement explains that the driverless car system does care about the safety of the people who buy it. So if the lady in the story has a regular car, who knows if she will be on time for work, there is a possiblity that she will be, and she will not be ready to go.

Yes, the driverless car is said to have a negative outlook, but the positive outlook shines more than the negative outlook does. Driverless cars could help people of the future. Everyone has at least seen a movie with a driverless car in it, like Transformers. In the movie, nothing bad happens to the car, the car just drives by itself and both the driver and the car are safe. In passage 7, the article states ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Which mens while the driver is driving and the car is not driving by itself, the car is still watching the driver to make he or she is safe.

Many reasons the driverless cars are good inventions for the future is because they are reliable. In passage 7, the author states ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This explains how the driverless is safe because when the driver is not driving and the car needs he or she for something, the car will notify the driver.

Now imagine if the woman in the very beginning did not have a driverless car. Who knows, the woman probably have gotten into a car crash because she was running late to work. Unsafe right? Now remeber, if the lady did have a driverless car, she would have been on time for work and she would have been on time for work safely. Owning a driverless car would make the future better because a lot more people would be safe and not get into accidents.

"Have you ever wondered what are some of the true dangers of exploring Venus? Venus is a broiling hot planet due to it being the second farthest planet from the Sun, which is our closest star.

Scientists have created multiple technological devices, but have they created enough for them to explore planets, such as Venus. Did you know people say Venus is a female planet.

In case the reader has not yet figured it out, this essay is about the planet in our solar system known as Venus.

Venus has a bad reputation and for a pretty good reason. No spaceship has ever landed there, neither has a space craft and survived for more than a few hours. This is because of the toxic gases that suround Venus. Its been three decades, thirty years, since scientists attempted to try to land another spaceship on Venus. This is because those toxic gases that suround Venus are ninety-seven percent of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acids, which is deadly for any living organisms' lungs from planet Earth. Planet Venus's toxic atmosphere makes it difficult for us humans to explore Venus.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure.

Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Despite these life-threatening dangers for scientists, it would amazing to explore Venus because it is something no human has ever done before. 1st sentence. It would be a worthy pursuit for sure. It would also be a lot of hard work just to discover how any human would be able to survive landing on Venus to explore it. It would be amazing as well to do something like this because future generations of people would know if they believe and work hard enough that they can do anything they set their mind to do. Anything is possible.

This essay was on Venus, a very dangerous planet. Venus is a dangerous planet becaus Venus is toxic. Venus is also full of hot weather and natural diasters. Those natural diasters are much more extreme than anything Earth has experienced or the people on Earth has and will ever see. Mercury is even cooler than Venus and Mercury is even closer to the Sun. Venus is a dangerous planet, but it would be well worth being able to finally explore.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Most people think that all you do is work, like taking care of animals. However, there are ways for you to have fun while working. You can play games, read a book, or even see cool sights. Here are a couple of things you could do.

First of all, you can see many different sights and explore while traveling. I know that I have visited some really cool places, like seeing an excavated castle in Crete. You can also see many different things. You could see the beautiful, wavy water or see a beautiful sunset while you travel. Another place I think you should visit is the Panama Canal. So, if you ever get bored and don't anything else to do, you should some beautiful sights and marvelous places. You may never know what you see and even make new friends along the way.

Second of all, you could play games if you get bored. The Seagoing Cowboys program isn't just all about working for animals. It's about having fun and playing games. For example, I know when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, we would play games, like table tennis, baseball, and even volleyball. You could also read too, if you would like. Where would you play these games, you ask? Back then, we would play in the empty holes where the animals have been housed.

Third of all, you could just have fun. You could read a book, play games, or even relax. Talk to the animals while you take care of them. If all you do is work and no fun, then you are going to not like being part of the Seagoing Cowboys. I remember when I did do a lot of fun stuff, but I had to do work first. I would like to tell you a very good story. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down the steps, but luckily I made it okay. I just couldn't work a couple of days because

I had cracked ribs. Trust me on this point. If you say to people that you had a great time, they would probably want to join too.

In conclusion, I made very good and understanding points. First, go visit some sights and places while you explore. Not only could you explore new worlds, but you could also meet new people and try out different languages. Second of all, you could play games. If you play games like volleyball and baseball, you will be more happier when you play games that if you just do work all the time and not have any fun. You will get bored and most likely not enjoy yourself all that much. Third of all, have fun. You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program for these reasons. Hope to see you there!",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The anachronism that is the electoral college is a system that unfairly represents voters and can possibly lead to catastrophe. The much simpler solution would be election by popular vote where every voter in every state matters rather than the system of the electoral college that discounts many voters opinions. The arguments against popular vote are either illogical or inconsequencial and we as a nation should pay no heed.

The biggest and most obvious problem with our current electoral college system is that it unfairly represents voters in the states. An example of this unfairness towards voters propagated by the system is expressed in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner where it is stated that in the 2012 election between Romney and Obama Florida gave all of its electoral votes towards Obama when he only won 61.7 percent of the vote. This method completely exludes the opinion of the minority, that 48.3 percent of people in Florida who didn't vote for Obama got their say taken away, their opinion no longer mattered to the election because all of the electors were given to Obama by a small majority. A second unfairness to the voters is the attention taken away from any voter not in a swing state. In the article written by Bradford Plumer named ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it is said that in the 2000 election that seventeen states got no attention from the candidates whatsoever. This system gives undeserved attention to a few swing states which will decide the election because of our outdated system of the electoral college. If popular vote was instituted the attention given to voters of all states would be equal as every vote from every state matters.

A problem with the electoral college that could possibly outshine the unfairness of it would be the potential for catastrophe that it brings. As is stated in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer the electors presented by the states according to popular vote are not even obliged to vote for the candidate they said they would. Even though this may be a rare occurace a single elector betraying his party could cause misrepresentation of millions of Americans. Another possible disaster would be a tie vote in the electoral college. This situation, as explained in the same article, would cause a vastly unfair election incomparable even to the unfairness of the normal system. This horrible system consists of each state getting one vote for the president which when you consider that some states have many times the population of others means that millions upon millions of people could have the same say a a couple hundred thousands, an injustice unthinkable in our society and one that could be stopped by instituting a popular vote system.

The arguments against popular vote presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner are unrealistic, unsupported, or insignificant. The argument presented as ""Certainty of Outcome"" says that a dispute over popular vote would be much more common but provides no evidence to support the claim, invalidating it. The article's second argument states that candidates would have more incentive to stay in their region if popular vote were implemented but this entire argurment relies on the fact that there are not enough electors in any one region in order to elect a president. Although this is true it doesn't matter because the same is true of population, no one region has an overwhleming population advantage over others and population is what matters in popular vote. The third arguement is the most illogical stating that the electoral college's tendency of causing only swing states to matter is actually a good thing because it increases the education of the populations of those states by the increased attention by the candidate, therefore the educated would decide the vote, making it more accurate. This is a parochial and shortsighted viewpoint, not considering the fact that the system of popular vote would make candidates pay attention to all populations, making all voters more educated rather than having some elite educated aristocracy in the swing states. The articles fourth argument is possibly even more deluded than the third, stating that large states get more attention because of the electoral college which balances out the fact that states have hugely varying populations but the exact same thing would happen in popular vote because some states have larger populations and candidates need larger populations for election in popular vote. The electoral college in this instance changes nothing meaning that the argument leads nowhere. The only argument presented in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner that has any merit is the fifth which shows that popular vote could lead to possibly complicated run-off elections. Although that is a disadvantage of popular vote I believe that the vast unfairness and averting disaster is worth the cost of slightly complex run-off elections.

To support the eletoral college one must rely on unrealistic or insignificant evidence. This ""evidence"" can be easily refuted and outwieghed by strong evidence from the opposing side. To support the electoral college you are supporting unfairness and catastrophe and to any reasonable person that is not a very intelligent idea, making the need for popular vote irrefutable.",5,4,3,4,2,3,3,4,3
"Autonomous cars are not the thing of the future. At this point in time, our technology can not match real life situations. There are too many conditions and too many saftey standards that are virtually impossible to accomplish while creating a ""Driverless Car"".

In the subtitle; Sensing the World, it explains how most of the driverless cars act and how they truely work. Many of the first productions were meant to run a specific track rigged with wires, magnets, and etc. This technology would be far too expensive, so we must rely on sensors and other features connected directly to the car. The problem with sensors, video cameras, and laser systems, is that they all can malfunction. The last thing anyone wants to do is to rely on something may indeed malfunction and put them in danger. Even if we were to say that the sensors and other technology was working in top shape, there still are limits to them such as poor lighting, bad weather conditions, and even animals.

Overall, we as human should not rely on technology to perform one of the worlds dangerous daily functions. Instead of progressing AI control, we should focus more on how the car would react if we the humans lost control. We have come this far by manual control, why switch now? Most accidents that occur on the road are drunk driving, distraction, and un safe conditions. Built in technology would be able to counter both driving under the influence and distractions.",2,3,2,2,1,2,1,1,2
"The article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" talks about a boy named Luck who recently graduated high school. Luck worked two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank, when Don Reist Luck's friend invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat Luck could never said no, because he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime.

To help the European cuntires recover from World War 2,the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to transport the horses,young cows,and mules Luck and Don signed up.

Luck and Don received their ordes to repot to New Orleans, they arrived August 14,the day the Pacific War ended. They were headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.

Luck had just turned eighteen before they arriving in Greece. By the time he was discharged in '47

Luke had made nine trips. To past the time on return trips they would play baseball, volleyball,table-tennis tournaments,fencing boxing ,reading whitting and games also helped to pass the time.

"Dear Mr. Senator,

I believe that there should not be such thing as an Electoral College. I feel it is not fair to our country. When people vote they vote for who they want to win and think is best for their country but in the end, it all does not matter because the Electoral College makes the final descision. If its our country, we should be able to vote for whoever we want and who ever gets the most popular vote, wins.

I also agree with Bob Dole, ""Abolish the electoral college!"" It is unfair and irrational to our country. When you think about it, If 3 people: one for each member in the House Of Representatives and two for your senators, it could be unfair. What if those three people are going for Republicans? and the majority of their state that they represent votes for Democrats? it would not be fair to the rest of the state because they all wanted the opposite of what the Electoral College wanted, so the Electoral College basically gets to make the final decision of who they want in office.

Sincerely, the people of our country.",1,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Should driveless cars be around? Yes altough they bring negative effects they also bring positive effects. For example they will use half the fuel todays cars use, which will help out the environment. Another thing is that they wont completely be driveless so that we can take over when we feel necesary or the cars feel necesary.

There are alot of accidents thanks to texting while driving with the driveless cars there would be way less because, the car has a safety feature which wont permit the driver to drive if he or she is texting. What if the driver is distracted?, well there will be cameras to watch if the driver is focused on the road or not. The car will also notify the driver when it needs human skills such as, driving threw work zones or around accidents.

Finally the GM has developed a drivers seat that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Google's car announces when the driver should be prepare to take over. Althoug countries like Canada and Florida has made driveless cars illegal, yet manufactures say that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. What do you think are driveless cars making the world a better place with its safety features or should we make driveless cars illegal?",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studing Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the knowledge to be gained is greater than and equal to the risk taken. But technolocial advancements are encouraging the further study of Venus and speeding up the process.

By teaching us that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" and that it is relatively the closest planet to ours in the solar system, the author sees that ""Stiving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity...Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). Meaning that the author supports the idea that studying Venus because the risk taken should be seen as a challenge needing to be conquered.

In Paragraph 7 the author states that ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus...electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions""(7). Thus demonstrating that the further studying of Venus is inevitable due to advancements that could decrease the possible risks of pursuing the sudy of Venus and eliminate the dangers.

In conclusion, the author supports the claim that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents because the knowledge to be gained is greater than or equal to the risks taken because the author sees it as a challenge rather than a risk, needing to be overcame. In additon, further technological advancements make studying Venus inevitable and is eliminating the problematic dangers that studying Venus presents.",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Going to Venus sounds like an amazing things to do. In ways it is very similar to Earth. Even though both planets are similar they are vastly different. Even if we could go to Venus it doesn't seem like it would ve worth the trip. From the information we would gain, extreme conditions, and the cost of all of it, the pursuit of studying Venus doesn't seem like its worth it.

I don't believe we would learn very much from going to Venus. In paragraph 6 the author mentions that, ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, Rendering standard forms of photography and videography inffective."" So even before going we already know that we wouldn't be able to see what the surface of Venus very well. This makes studying Venus harder because most of us would want a see what they are studying. The author also says, ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus we need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" The surface of Venus has an average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, so get up close and personal isn't very likely to be successful. Even if it was successful there is a lot of risk involved to just find out what the surface of it is made out of, but if we foind out what it was made up of what could we with knowledge.

Venus is also a very dangerous place to be because of the harsh conditions. Dangerous like the previously mentioned average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure that is over 90 times greater than Earth's. Venus also has erupting volcanoes, strong earthquakes, and a lot of lightning. It would be hard to survive there let alone gather information about it. Even machines would have a hard time surviving this harsh conditions. The author tries to counter this by saying that we use ""a blimp-like vechile hovering over 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape, but even then we would learn almost nothing because it would be hard to get samples from that height.

One thing I am sure the author left out on purpose is the cost how much would all cost. I'm no expert of space exploration, but I am sure of one thing it isn't cheap. How much would all the research and technology to even get a to Venus cost. I'm sure it would cost billions of dollars because there is a reason we stop sending rockets into space, and its because it costs too much. This project seems like it would cost a lot of tax payer money,and for the possibility of learning what Venus's surface is made of.

Even with the author's persuasive article, I still not convinced that studying Venus is worth the trouble. It would provide little information that would actually be useful for us. Venus's conditons are to extreme for us to get information about it. The trip to Venus would cost a lot of money. The author while making it seem possible and makes it seem impossible to learn about Venus.",3,3,3,2,1,2,2,3,1
"First of all, if i were to inform citizens everywhere about the advantages of car usages, then i'll say this. we find ourselves to go to many different locations by car each day, and what i mean by this is that it is an advantage. while there are many countries who claims that cars are an advantage to us, there are a certain few places and citizens who want to make a change to this. By changing, they mean getting rid of or forbidding the use of cars. to many people, the first step to this is to forbid the uses of street parking, driveways, and home garages.

Even though this makes a bit of sense, i believe that a good reason for doing this would be because of the harmful fumes that cars release that pollute the air that we ourselves breathe in. there is also proof for this as well, for example, It's said that in Beijing, China, is known to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. this is a shocking fact. although we recieve this devastating news, i believe that we can make a no-polluting world by not using our automobiles for the time being, i can say that although this might not permenantely make the air cleaner, but we can if we just prevent ourselves from using our cars.

Next comes this, we are also aware on how in Bogota, Colombia, that there is little use for cars, since they are only permitting the transport of buses and taxis. however if a violater is caught driving his own vehicle, that person will recieve a $25 fine. there are even a number of people who have claimed that it's a great way to take away stress and lower air pollution. and if this keeps up at an average pace in the next few years, Bogota, Colombia will be confirmed as a clean and non-polluting place.

Then comes a known fact of where people are starting to least often drive cars over the past few years, and this has been proven true since many citizens are realizing that it has to be the fact alone on that people are less likely to get their licenses or that they may be dealing with a bit of money trouble, and that the unemployed are less likely to work any longer.

Lastly, as it comes all down to these facts, i still believe that we may one day drive our automobiles without doing anything harmful to our enviornment, and at the same time, our automobiles are being useful every single day, since it is another way of getting around to places in where we need to be. such as jobs, going to school, and many more. it may be difficult to believe my opinion on this, but it will get much more simplier as it goes on to progress itself.",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0
"Im going to be talking about driverless cars and my oppinion or position on them, I think they are a great idea, they keep people safe and notifies when they need human skill required.

Driverless cars keep you safer than if a human was driving, human error can make the difference between life and death when it comes to driving, if there is a car that doesnt need to be driven by humans, we need to fund it for safety and the advamcement of our society. Driverless cas are also safe for when they have problems that the car's computer cant handle then it notifies the driver when it does want human skill, eventually we will have cars that will need no human skill and fatal car crashes will not happen as often. If the car can drive itself and not crash nearly as often as humans do then what if everyone had one, will there be no more fatal car crashes or even crashes, will crime rates go down because the car will most likely have a sensor that is related to the owner of the vehicle so they cant get away from the police or car owner.

In a perfect world there will be no more car crashes of any sort, yes there will be the occasional fender bender, but with no more death because of fatal car crashes and saftey will rise and crime rates will go down, these are all what if's, but if these were to come true the whole world will change completly.",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

If you take a look at Colombia for instience they have a day where in bogota 7 million people are banned using there cars for a day they find alternatives to get around like biking hiking walking busses and taxi cabs doing this is a good way to stop air polluion and also to promote alternatives transportation and if people violate it theres a fine of $25 a bussiness man by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza says ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution""

"Dear

State Senato r,

I think that the Electoral College should change to popular votes for the president and I have a few reasons why: When people vote for a president they are actually voting for the Electoral College and the Electoral College votes for the president themselves and sometimes the voters vote for the wrong canidate and the presindent they wanted to vote for might not win the election, Some states do not get to see their canidates or the election and don't know who to vote for. I think that voters should be able to vote who they want to run our country and not have the Electoral College decide for them. They have a voice and a mind to their own and I believe that we should have a say on who should be our president, our leader, someone who will stop ISIS and to stop terroists and bombings, someone who will pass laws that child abuse should be illegal. It can be argued that the Electoral Colleges method of selecting the president might turn off potential voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Candidates have a winner-take-all system and its unfair because they do not spend time in states that they know will have no chance winning. I think that they should give them a chance, just because they think that they can;t win it doesn't make it tur, its more of their opinion. The Electoral College is unfair to voters, outdated, and irrational. The Electoral College won the popular vote but lost the presidency. The voters would prefer a direct election.",2,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,0
"Imagine being able to detect other peoples feelings when they try to hide their emotions. Two doctors think they have the power to do so, Proffesor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsredam and Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

I believe that the new advancment would be a wonderful idea. I believe that seeing somebody's when they are trying to hide them is gonna bring new thrills to life. Actually knowing someone's emotions could be beneficial for thing such as suicide maybe if we knew what somebody's emotions were we would be able to help somebody to make them feel happy. In the passage article for has a quote saying ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I believe this is a good quote because it ties in with me saying that emotions could help people but having facial emotions would benefit as well because then we would not only physically see someone's emotion but we would be able to feel the happiness, pain,anger or etc.

So overall I think Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman could possibly have a amazing overall invention there are lots of positives for this invention.

"In my opinon I don't think that driverless cars should be made or yet even tested. I believe that the car could stop working in the middle of driving people some where. Then those people would get into a car crash because they can't do anything because it is a driverless car. Yes, it sounds great and cool to not have to drive a car and it do it itself, but there are many things that can go wrong with this idea.

What happens when something goes wrong with the car? Who is to be blamed? The owner or the person/company who made the car? These are just a few questions I have over this topic. I believe that if something goes wrong with the car and someone gets hurt the owner shouldn't be the one to get blamed. It should be the person/company who made the car because they are suppose to make sure the car is safe for people to even be in, and safe for the road since a computer is driving it.

What if someone hacks into the software/data base of the car and makes it drive people and into the middle of nowhere, to an abondon house, or something like that so they could get killed? What do you do then? Has anyone thought about that? I doubt that has crossed any of the companies, who want to makes these cars, mind. I mean you hear on the news all the time about all these people getting hacked. What's going to stop these hacker from not hacking into these driverless cars to harm certain people they have a strong hate to? If they really wanted to hurt someone they will stop at nothing to do that. How are these cars even going to be safe? Its like asking a three year old to drive a car. And I know that I don't want a three year old driving me around from place to place on a daily bases.

So I am strongly against these driverless cars. If someone can prove me wrong about any of the topics I brought up I would be glad to hear them. I do doubt that anyone can have evidence about some of this stuff not coming true if driverless cars are made. Many things can go wrong with these cars.

"Have you ever been told what your emotional expression is by a computer. A new software has been made that can recognize emotions. It has been made to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First, it constructs a 3-D model of the face and the muscels in the software must move like human muscles. It makes an exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It shows you your emotion by using the location of your face muscles. For example in paragraph 3 it states,"" Your frontalis par leteralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised.""

Second, It can tell you if you have mixed emotions. It can calculate exact emotions while we can partialy do this. In paragraph 5 it states that "" You can probally tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The computer can show you this.

Third, The computer can help you by knowing what your emotion is. It can see when your happy looking at something so it can show you more stuff like that. It can see when your sad so it wont show you more stuff like that. It can see when your confused at something and so it can explain it to you differently so you wont be confused.

"Driverless cars are starting to make an appearance in the world. There are postive and negative ideas about these new cars. Threre are ways it can effect the world and help it and other ways. Some like the idea of these new driverless cars and some do not like it.

I personally would like to live in a time like this. There are a lot of new ideas coming along that can change and help the world become a better place. Driverless cars can help the world in many ways, from taxi systems to gas money, and even pollution. The taxi system would haul people to and from work,school,mettings, or even if you're just going out. This would lead to more money you would not have to speend on gas. The less money you spend on gas the less pollution in the world.

I could also see why driverless cars can also have a big negative impact. Even though they are not completley driveless yet, they still have some small risk. If a driveless car approaches a construction zone the car can not go through the zone by itself, it would have to be under human control. If you are in a hurry and need to get somewhere quick it would be wise not to hop into one of these cars, driving time is a lot slower in these than in normal cars. Another reason why they put humans at risk is the car wrecks. Most of these wrecks would be because of computer error, and they have fixed these to work perfect. It may not be a good idea to take this in a snow storm but Google cofounder says they have not had a car accident in more than half a million trips in their driverless cars.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile""

talks about how they have a new system and it can detect how a person is feeling. This new tecnology can be very helpful for students. I believe it can be helpful to students because there are some people who feel depressed and it is complicated to tell if they are happy, depressed, or angry.

This can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don't even know how they feel. Some students might say ""that computer doesn't know how I feel"" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good sorce. The people who created ""FACS"" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute fo advance at the University of Illinos working woth Prof. Therefore, they the system ""FACS"" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.

This system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states ""Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness."" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements"" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything. This is an example of how this new system can help students and teachers.

All of these are examples of how this system ""FACS"" can help students and that is is valuable.",2,2,2,2,0,0,1,2,0

"Mar's Face

Many people think that Mars has life living on it. One example would be the two mile long landform, the Face. People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.

When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.

Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.

Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,"" which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it. They do have a point that it would be hard to get a clear image of the Face with challenging weather. Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation. Scientists found that is was a Martian mesa but the unusual shadows made it look like a face. NASA also found that it was nothing more than a natural landform and the Face looks very similar to buttes or mesas here on earth. Others think that NASA could not have gotten good pictures because of the weather, but NASA has proven that the Face is just a natural landform. The Face is just a strange piece of Mars and not a symbol of alien history.",3,4,3,3,1,2,1,3,2

"Human emotions are a pain sometimes because some of the time you can't tell whe someone is faking a smile or just being fake in general. I think having a computer facial recongition is a great idea.

The computer reconigition can be great for inside a class room. In paragraph 6 it states"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Now i think that is an amazing idea it would help each and every one of the students across the world. Admit it who likes to be confused because i sure don't. If we are able to invent something like that it would be a world changing product

Also it can show if a child or even an adult is having a sign of depression in life. People keep emotions bottled up and it is not good for people, a lot people who tend to be depressed don't really like to talk to anyone about they're problems but it could be a life saver if the case needed to be done. Even if something makes you smile fakely in paragraoh 7 they say "" raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slighy..., holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes."" now if you follow those rules you even start to smile and feel happy for a second.

In the end the professors that made this invention are genius's because they may have saved many lifes and people who don't pay attention. There are so many other things that you can think of to make it help. Finally overall the facial expression reconigiton is all in all a great invention.",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"I am for the development of driverless cars. For some, driving is not their strong suit and a system like this would help out a lot of people. Most car car crashes result from people lacking the ability to drive well. These driverless cars can help people who might have had too much to drink, people who are not good at driving, and many more types of people that drive. Not everyone will want this system in their car so it should be an option for the driver if they want to drive or not.

If these driverless cars are safe and can function well, then there will be less accidents and driving would be one less problem for people to worry about.

If there are going to be smart cars then there needs to be smart roads as well. ""General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar, but they used magnets with alternating polarity as messages in binary code. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive."" This passage shows the reader that this smart-road system could work because it worked in the past. The only problem is that it is an expensive system. In the future money can be made to make this system a reality. Google modified a Toyota Prius with a sensor system. ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. The combination of all this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel."" This shows the reader tha the car can have the skills of a human driver and that there is a way to make driverless smart cars. This same system can be used for future driverless cars.

I am for the development of driverless cars. Driverless cars can make life easier for many people. There are smart car systems that can very possibly be used in the future that can make these driverless smart cars a reality. This idea should be used in the future and can totally change that world we live in.",1,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2
"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the new technology called "" Facial Action Coding System,"" would identify human emotions. In the first paragraph the author is telling you about Mona Lisa and what the doctors are trying to tell others. The software is almost like yourself talking to a person and knowing their emotions, but in a computer. Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang are working together to see how to work and use the latest innovation.

Some are asking questions like "" Can we actually calculate emotions?"" or "" How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express our emotions?"" I as of the rest of the curious world would want to see how this new technolgy works. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are working to make this to only bring smiles to someones face each day as shown is paragraph six. Dr. Huang believes that students doing homwork on a computer usually become more bored while doing something boring on a computer, so Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman want to have a computer know about your feelings like people do.

As shown in paragraph eight muscles show that some actions might show others that you either have a forced smile or an genuine one. So letting computers know how you feel and helping you genuinly smile would help your day and help Both Drs. know they had helped sombody have a better day. When you smile to show ""Mona Lisa Smile"" to the computer it will show an add appearing on your screen and then a similar afterwards. If you frown the ad will be different after the first one proving that you aren't happy.

The new software could help others become more energectic and happier on most days other than frowning and having an awful day. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are proving to the world that increasing happiness will help other feel better on a daily basis and want to do more.",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
"The new technology which is called Facial Action Coding System should be banned because let's see if your sad or angry, you wouldnt want other people to know how you feel instead of just telling them by your own. It sometimes can be use for just certain things and if that person gives you permission to look at the Site, then yeah it can be used to determine how they are feeling. Some people may think this new technology may be an awesome technology but some other people may also think that is just as same as other technology. For example, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This means that this technology mostly works only when your smile like it said on the text. Yeah it may be awesome to other people but like i said it should be banned because there is no point on having that techology if that person tells you how they are felling. Clearly, this technology should be banned because it is not used correclty and every person who uses it is, it's using it too much and that's not how it works.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear Florida State senator,

I am in favor of changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states. Changing the election by popular vote is more efficient than the electoral college process. Inputing this into the political voting system would enhance the voting process making it less difficult to deal with, get rid of the electoral college and its faults, and get the U.S citizens opinion on who the president should be and not just the electors voting for the president.

As you are already of aware of, the electoral college is the process where it consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and the Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. By the explanation of what the electoral college is, you and I and many others can conclude that this process takes too much work;much more work than really does need to be put into place. Even though most Americans aren't aware of that when they are electing for their choice of the president they comprimise with the most, they are really voting for electors to vote who the next president will be. It's not fair and it's not right.

While reading an article about the electoral college(by Brad Plumer), I noticed that the electoral college system has numerous instances of it that make it wrong. While in place Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. chamber of commerce all agreed on abolishing the electoral college; And I compromise with this agreement because it is completely accurate and make sense as to why these political figures wanted to rid of the electoral college. This is called a ""Disaster Factor"" according to paragraph 11 in the article ""The Indefinsible Electoral College"" meaning that the state legislatures are literally responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. How wrong is this? Also given that so many voter vote for one party for president and another for congress, the House of Representatives' selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.

In source 3 of the article, it was very precise on as to why the electoral college should no take place. Our country has both republicans and democrats. Not all democrats have the same opinions as republicans, and not all republicans have the same thoughts as democrats. According to paragraph 15, the Electoral college is widely regarded as anachronism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that should be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes is the winner. This is not fair to people who are democrats. The electoral system is obviously based off of mostly and strictly Republican beliefs. The voting process should be based on just republican bias, but also democrat bias. It's as if the democrats thoughts mean nothing. Paragraph 19 made a claim that Republican bias is baed strictly off of the region in which on lives, because majority of Reoublicans live in the southern states of the U.S. This makes other people(No party, Democrats, etc.) that are inhabited in othe regoins of the U.S. feel disenfranchised and feel as if their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, and that this person is not really their president.

The article gave me an outlook of what the electoral college really is and how it works. The electoral college is not a fair process at all, and it is way the complicated for the people involved in some political job that is involved with the president, it is hard on the citizens that live in this country that have an idea of what president they want to vote for, and it is hard on us as a nation. The election process should be changed by the process of popular vote of the country's citizens. The  electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. The electoral college needs to be abolished as soon as possible. Please take this into high consideration.

"Do you want to elect the president? The electoral college doesn't allow that unless you're an elector. Voting for president should be done with a popular vote rather than an electoral college. An elecotoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

An electoral college is unfair. In source two, it says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know have no chance of winning..."" This shows that candidates don't treat everyone the same. They spend more time in states that have a chance of winning. Some states never even get to see who the candidates are.

Not only are electoral colleges unfair, they're also outdated. The electoral college has been being used since 1960. In source two, it says, "" It happened in Hawaii in 1960."" This proves that the electoral college has been around for many years, and it's time for something new. Things change along with time, a new system would improve voting.

The electoral college is irrational. In an electoral college, you don't vote for the president, you vote for a slate of electors that then vote for the president. In source two, it says, ""Under the electoral college  system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This proves that the system doesn't make sense and citizens should be able to directly vote for the president of their country.

To conclude, the electoral college system should be abolished. It is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Abolishing the electoral college would improve voting and make citizens want to vote.",3,4,2,3,2,2,2,1,3

"The age of cars has come to a grinding stop. Atleast, That's what the general consensus of these 4 articles seems to be. Although current youth do not see car buying as a major thing in their lives right now, it is highly unlikely it will remain as such because of the structure of an average american lifestyle.

Cars are a massive staple of the world and hold many things together and allow for fast, easy, convenient travel. The young people of today do not currently have to use cars to get where they are going because of many factors such as friends with cars, human powered forms of transportation - such as bicycles, skateboards, etc.-and parents with cars. Once these children move away from home to a college or to a job elsewhere they will need a car to maintain a normal lifestyle. We are currently in a second baby-boom, this means that there are many young people that do not need cars and thus do not have one, swaying the data away from the ""car culture"". While it is true that some people are trying to reduce their ""carbon footprint"" by driving less and using public transportation, the number of them is very small and irrelevant when compared to all people in the world. Cars maintain a large amount of appeal that cannot be found in any other form of transportation: This appeal is that it is your vehicle, to do whatever you want with and be free, it is also easy and convenient to get from place to place, it is a place to hang out with your friends and/or a significant other, it is also faster than any other form of transportation short of a helicopter or plane. Cars have so many benefits that people will not just quit driving because of increased carbon emissions, most of which is not entirely the fault of cars.

While cars do put out a large amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, that amount is inconseqeuntial compar3ed to the massive amou nts of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanos and by other human creations. One volcanic eruption emits around the same amount of carbon dioxide in a few hours as the entire country of America does in 10-15 years. Cars are not the true issue here, the main reason carbon dioxide is on tthe rise is because of the lack of trees and worldwide deforestation. All plant life can convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, this means that more plant life equals less carbon dioxide. Instead of trying to reduce the number of cars in the world and make life harder on many people, the focus of the world should be to increase the amount of vegetation in the world so as to counterbalance the number of cars in the world.

Cars have long been an important factor in the world social, political, and economical structure. Before the second World War, Fuhrer Adolf Hitler decided that his people needed a cheap, basic car so as to increase Germany's economic prowess. Due to this vision Volkswagen, The people's car, was started. Volkswagen marked the start of cheap, affordable cars for everyday people. Although Germany lost World War II, their technology and ideas diffused to much of the world thanks to American and Soviet research. Their idea of a people's car spread around the world and the 1950's marked the start of massive sprawling suburbs that relied on personal vehicles to get to and from work, the store, school, or anywhere outside of the suburbs. This was a totally new type of lifestyle; It wasn't urban life where you could walk or ride a bus wherever you needed, and it wasn't rural where you made everything by hand and didnt travel often. No, this was something entirely new that was brought about because of the advent of cheap affordable personal transportation. Now everyone can get to work relying on only themselves and not bus drivers or train operators, people have a new sense of freedom afforded them by this magnificent new machine, the car.

The same ideas and principles that made cars such an important part of culture and life in the 1950's still remain in our lives today. Cars will remain an important part of world culture until another form of trasportation is easier, more convenient, and/or cheaper. A car gives its driver a fast, freeing, and flexible form of transportation unparalleled by anything today. Car use should not be limited, it should be encouraged.

"There are alot reasons to keep our the despised method of choosing the President. The First reason is because Certainty of Outcome, in the text its states that ""The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. Another example from the text is ""Obama, he recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... because all of the states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.

Another reason is that the Electiral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal,in that case, no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, a solid regional favorite such as Romney was in the South , has no reason to campaign in those states because of the poor economy and because its not a wealthy state, he wont be able to campaign heavily. So he left with no votes and would have to find his Electoral College votes in a more suitable area. In the text its states that ""It is a Desriable result because a candidate with regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""

Also the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance the large states by population lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment Senate decreed in the Constitution. My proof is in the text ""The popular vote was very close in Florida in 2012 nevertheless Obama who won the that vote got 29 electoral votes. A same victory by the same margin in Wynoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.""So, other things equal, a large state gets more attention compared to a small state.

And Finally the Electoral College avoids the problemof elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For example ""Richard Nixon in '68 and Bill Clinton in '92 both had on 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the in the Electoral College.

In Conclusion I think that the we should keep Electoral Colleges and changing to election by popular voting to vote for a President.",2,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

"In the essay ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an great job of describing how Venus would be a very worthy persuit depite all of the dangers. Venus is the closest planet to earth. In the essay the author states that it is known as Earth twin. That is in terms of desity and size though.

In the essay the author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This statement in the essay opens many new ideas to support why exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit. Its starts to make the reader wonder what happened to the planet to make it look the way it does now. Even though it is very dangerous the mission to Venus could posibbly be held to many discorvory's, and this is what the author is telling us he thinks that it is worth it and it definetly is.

Then you get the reader wondering how do we study a planet we can't even land on. The text states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the suface of Venus would allow the scientist to float above the fray."" Then the author compares that to flying above storms in airplanes today. This would allow the humans not to get hurt while testing Venus. The author has given the reader a good way to see how it would be possible for scientis to experiment on Venus. That is another way he makes it seem like a worthy pursuit.

Last of all he makes a point that this step would not just gain insight of the planet, but it will allow us to target bigger task. The text states ""not only because insight gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intiminadating endeavors."" This alows the reader to devolop a sense to what might happen after they experiment on Venus they will start on another dificult task. The author wants the reader to know that this is all in the devolopment in are world. It will alow us to further and that is great for this world to discorver new places.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does an amazing job of making sure the reader understand that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit. In the essay he gives us a reason why which is it is the most earth like planet in our solar sytem. Another reason is accomplishing the task of studying venus will allow us to think further and go futher in to are solar system and start discorvering more.

"Dear Senator, i am writing this letter in regaurds to the way we citizens vote. I feel as though we should vote using the popular vote. There are many different reasons i feel so strongly about this. So i will start telling you why i feel so strongly about this.

First,i think that the President and Vice President should be choose by our votes. The reason being is becasue we know what we want for our country. we look for the good and things like that in our president. I think it is only fair that we use the voting tecnique most votes because that means everyone gets a say on who runs our country.

Another reason i think we should go that route is beacuse people sometimes feel left out in all the things that have to do with our country. People want a president that keeps his/her word and one that can be the right person for the job. They want someone who knows who to be a leader because the person who gets chosen has this job for 4 years. I think that people have a right to vote for who they want to vote for not who the electors pick . I have no idea if this is aking any type of sense but i am writing this the best way i understand it.

That is how i feel about this whole thing i think people should have equal rights.  I also think that people should be able to pick who they want to be their leader. They should be able to view thier opitions and see what is best for not only the country but aslo their familes and themselfs. That is all i have to say about this whole thing.",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The build up of greenhouse gases and carbon emissions over the past hundred years since the car was first invented have started a decline in the usage of a private car. People are moving back into cities and are suing their cars signifigantly less with places such as Bogota Columbia having a day dedicated to no driving. Bikes and other forms of public transportation have become much more appealing than using a car and this trend looks like it will continue

In source one , in Vauban , Germany they are no longer using cars and instead are using alternative forms of transportation in this suburb. Heidrun walter a resident of this city talked about how he was ""always tense"" when owning a car which is true. It can be very stressful having to drive around and in the case of crowded areas have to sit in traffic for two hours a day. Another reason to get rid of your cars is the effects on the environment with 50% of carbon emissions in some parts of the US being blamed on cars. New laws in the US are also promoting the use of public transportation in the United States own suburbs giving suburban residents more of a reason to rid themselves of a car. In cities public transportation has been already implemented and can be much more efficent than driving around yourself.

The pollution in many cities such as Bejing is very intense and makes living conditions awful. Paris , one of the more polluted cites in Europe experienced a partial driving ban after a build up of smog in the city. This shows that if you rid yourself of a car you wont have to worry as much about contributing to this costly pollution to our environment. During the driving ban congestion was down 60% shwoing how this contribute to less traffic as well. In source 3 it discusses the no car day in Bogota Columbia showing how worldside people are starting to avoid overusing their cars and want to promote a healthy planet for us all. Parks and biking paths have emerged in this emerging latin american city and its shifting towards the right direction , of no cars.

The car culture in America has begun to die down a bit in the United States with car usage peaking 2005(Source 4). Car ownership rates are going down and more people are begining to just not get their lisences at all , and this trend will continue showing that you too should hop on this trend of lower to no car usage at all. Car companies such as Ford are changing their marketing by being more of a mobility than a car company to allow them to stay around in this decline of cars in the modern world.",2,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Venus and the Earth the differentes is the Earth is more bigger then Venus the nickname is Evening Star and the samalier is they both are floating onthe air.

Venus and the Earth

the different is Earth is more bigger. The Earth is different because living can live in Earth. I also think that they both are grate in their time. The different is Venus is small and shiny the can help the Earth to bright at night. They are beautiful too mose of girls like it. Also the Earth have oxygen to breath but the Venus does not because it live on the sky.

the samalier Venus and Earth they both float on the air. Also they

oth are useful. They both grate at their place the Venus is good for night time it gave light the Earth is good for living thing and people. They both have grateness.

The Venus sometime come around the corner in space. Onetime the cloud - draped world it's take few hours. This explain that the spaceship touch down on Venus more then three time. This explain that the spaceship are real.

I don't understand some of it so

I am just going to right another makeup story okay.

I thinks People loke Earth more because they can live in there and they have the best oxygen in the Earth. Venus is too small for the living thing the Earth is the grate place for them. So they will chose the Earth if tell them to pick one to live.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Everyone shows emotion at some point in their lives. Whether it be joy, sorrow, or even anger everyone has expressed their emotions in one way or another. Now there is a computer software that can recognize six emotions. Reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom using this technology is valuable because it could tell the instructor when a student is confused, it could modify the lesson, and it could help people feel more empathy for each other.

Students can become confused very quickly when an instructor is teaching about something. This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.

Many teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn. An example of evidence from the text of this is when Dr. Huang talks about how using this technology teachers could modify their lesson so that it would be easier for their students to learn, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This helps point to the fact that it could help everyday teachers know when their students aren't completely grasping the lesson that they are teaching. This technology could also help people have more empathy for each other.

People present day are always talking about how nobody has any empathy for each other. This software could fix this especially in the classroom. A student would know when their fellow student would be sad and they would be able to talk to them and help them overcome the sadness. Another reason empathy may happen would because we unconciously imitate other people's facial expressions. Here is a quote from this article where the author, Nick D'Alto is talking about how this technology could cause empathy, ""Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This would help people show more empathy for each other. Overall this would be a great addition to the classroom.

Having this software in a classroom setting would stop students from becoming confused from a lesson, help modify the lesson so that an instructor could make the lesson more understandable for students, and give people more empathy. These reason give evidence that having this computer software in a classroom would not only benefit the students but benefit the teachers as well by giving them that peace of mind that their students get the lesson that they are teaching.",5,4,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Dirverless cars can be good or bad, safe or reckless, and smart or dumb. Either way our technology is advancing and it may be adavncing too quickly. A good thing about the car is that its easier for disabled people and a bad thing is technology isnt always reliable. The cars could cause less accidents or cause even more. The cars could be the smartest thing the world could have or it could be the dumbest.

The thing about driverless cars is that we are not learning control and once again the world is getting even more lazy. Most of the time no one will be paying attention with them not having to drive. They will be too distracted listening to the radio, sleeping, talking on the phone, talking to passengers, or texting. Also if the person would need to take over they wouldnt be able too because they wouldnt know when to take over, because of the distraction.

16 year olds wont be able to drive normally, because they will never learn because of the driverless cars. The teenagers would just sit in the car just like a passenger and not drive. The teens would be so distracted with all their social media and texting they would have time to react if something went wrong. If the teenager needed to take over they would know what to do because they didnt learn how to drive right.

Although this is a rather good thing for disabled people. If they have an amputated leg or leg and actually any disability that would still allow them to drive it would be easiar on them, because they may not be able to drive 100 percent of the time. They would be less stressed out on people yelling at them for being too slow and fighing and conflicting with them.

Disabled people already can drive, you can get a prostedic leg and still be able to drive. If they cant drive 100 percent of the time they should be driving anyway. That is a huge hazard on the road. It could lead to many accidents and multiple injuries or even death.

Driverless cars will come whether we like them or not. I personally do not want the driverless cars, but I would have to deal with it and embrace it. I still think there needs to be a long time inbetween now and when they do come out so it gives our people and technology time to embrace it and get used to the Driverless Cars.",3,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"To start, people use cars everyday to go to work, drive their kids to school, or just going out somewhere. Some people instead of using a car to get somewhere in close distance they ride a bike or walk there. Like poeple use cars for long distances like going to work, visiting someone that might live in a different county than you. Limiting car usage is an advantage because it allows you to get more exercise, doesn't cause more pollution, and causes less traffic on the road.

Moreover, limiting car usage is an advantage because it allows you to get more exercise. When you need to go to a store thats right down the street, instead of taking a car; jog, walk, or ride a bike over there so you can get a breathe of fresh air. Walking to the store to get a few things allows you to stay in shape and not get tied down or lazy. When you drive a car your sitting down the whole time and not really moving besides moving your foot back and forth for the gas and brake, and moving your arms to turn the steering wheel. If you sit around all day and watch TV or you work all day and you have to sit down to work, walking somewhere instead of driving loosens up your legs because you've been sitting all day long.

Continuing, limiting car usage is an advantage because it keeps you from letting more pollution into the air from the smoke of your exhaust. Every day there is a ton of smoke from cars exhaust going to the air and polluting it even more. Smoke from cars exhaust has made most of the ozone layer around the Earth disappear because the smoke has rotted it away. The summers have been hotter and the winters have been extremely cold, record breaking almost every year because the ozone layer can't protect us from that as well anymore. Breathing in the smoke from cars exhaust isn't good for us either because it goes into our lungs. Breathing in smoke into your lungs can give a person cancer possibly.

Nevertheless, limiting car usage is an advantage because it causes less traffic. There is always an accident on the highway, side street, and neighborhood everyday because of traffic. When your in traffic its usually stop and go and someone might not brake in time or expect it and slam right into the back of you without you knowing and give and injury or kill you because of the traffic. Some people are very tense behind the wheel of a car and the slights little thing can startle them and make them have an accident. Some people get annoyed sitting in traffic and try to race through it at high rates of speed and maybe loose control and crash into someone. You hear about car accidents injuring people every day on the news because of traffic, most of the time its on the highway.

Without a doubt, limiting car usage is an advantage because it allows you to get more exercise, it keeps you from putting more pollution into the air, and causes less traffic on the road.

For those people who live close to a school, store, or work, take a bike or walk there instead using a car. Another plus to walking or riding a bike instead of driving is you will be saving money because you won't have to pay for gas.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
The topic of driverless cars is contradictive as both good and bad asspects of driverless cars have support. In my opinion completely driverless cars are unsafe while on the other hand cars that are autonomous but still allow for manual driver control are more reliable than both driver required and driverless cars. Entirely driverless cars are unpredictable as stated in the article in the case of an accident if technology fails is the driver at fault or the manufacturer if the car is completely autonomous. As technology developes i believe autonomous car systems will become more reliable but they should never completely replace a human driver as malfunctioning equipment can put pssengers as well as pedestrians lives at risk. In conclusion a line must define human and technological error on the road. Autonomous systems can be extremely helpfull and dependable while driving but should we as a species while we progress eliminate human interaction with our vehicals and can this lead to issues with driverless car systems.,1,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1
"I know this Face is just a natural landform because, in passage 5, its says, ""some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide"". This shows that people are going against what scientist are saying and that people have opinons that this is just a natural landform, and that this was naturally formed on Mars.

Also, people have taken pictures of this landform with a camera that is ten times sharper than the Viking photos, stated in passage 7. After they took these pictures with this high tech camera it showed there was no alien monument. When this landform was made and the first photo was shown it formed a humans face, it didn't form an alien. In passage 3 it says, ""illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" of a human being.

If a alien were to make this landform they would probably make it of them, something that actually looks like them not some other creature, like a human. ""When the camera was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 it was cloudy on the Red Planet"". While they were searching they never seen Alien markings.

So therfore, the clouds being so cloudy the alien markings where shown as never visible because, they were covered if there was any alien markings but, the camera shows there is no alien markings and that this is a natural landform. Some people have there opinons on if this was reall made by an alien but very few scientist believe this was made by an alien although some do. This is why I say that this is a natural landform and is not made by any type of alien in any form and that this landforn looks naturally made on Mars.",2,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"The authors support of the idea of going to Venus is not very well known, we can only infer whether they are for it or against it because they never fully specify. The author give some pros and cons to the exploration of the planet but does not pick one side more than the other. I believe that they author is against the idea of Venus exploration.

The authors pros and cons list combat eash other because, the author gives a pro on the exploration of Venus but instantly combats it with another con to weigh it out. One example of this is in paragraph 5 when the author states that the conditions of floating above planet Venus would be difficult but survivable for humans. However, right after making that statement, the authors first sentence in paragraph 6, combats the idea that it is survivable for humans because the article states, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and vidoeography ineffective."" From that statement we can infer that the author doesn't really see the exploration of humans going being very useful but, we can only infer because the author never specifies, for or against.

Another way we can infer that the author is against it, is by looking at paragraph 3 when the author is talking truthfully about the planet. The author explains that planet Venus has a thick atmorsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and that the planet's surface temperature averages out at over, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The way that the author describes Venus, is not in a way of much liking or making it sound like a good planet to send our people to. The author explains how dangerous Venus is by listing the weather barreries like ""...erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."", all in paragraph 3. By listing how dangerous the weather is, listing how hot and unlivable it is, and by saying that the lightening frequently strikes the probes trying to get into the planets atmosphere to land, we can only infer that the author doesn't really think that the dangers of humans being out into this kind of situation, is worth it.

Additionally, one last way we can infer that the author doesn't favor the idea of Venus exploration is that when in paragraph 2, the author states, ""Each previous mission is unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" That statment really pushes the idea that the author defiently doesn't not favor the idea of the exploration using man and spacecraft. But once again, we can only infer because the author never gave a clear personal opinion.

In conculsion, I believe that the author does not favor the exploration and does not think that the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it provides. The pros and cons weigh each other out, the planet is too dangerous with the heat, the weather, and the obsticles on the surface. The overall thought of the author shows no favor towards the exploration of Venus.",4,3,3,2,0,1,1,2,1
"You know you live in a fascinating generation when there are driverless cars avaliable! Driverless cars are a new invention where cars that do not require a driver to have control of the vehicle at all times. These vehciles will have basic driving skills. Think of all the benefits and oppertunities this new invention could bring to our society.

As almost everyone knows driving is a basic skill of being an adult. Sometimes though, adults can get very busy, sidetracked, or be multitasking. It is a normal thing and I am sure everyone does it, but unfortuntaly being sidetracked may mean getting into accidents. With this new driverless cars, the car drives for you, so if you need to apply your makeup or pick up a toy for your child that is crying in the back seat, you can! Have you ever backed out of a busy parking lot and slammed into a shopping cart that was just too tiny to see? Well with the driverless cars, they have sensors and will alert you. GM's invention has been to vibrate the driver's seat to alert the drivers, pretty neat, right? Toyota Prius's latest technolgy is there are 3-D laser beans around the car so if another car, person, etc. come close to the vehicle it will move out of the way, or take procautioins like an actual drive would do. I believe that these cars may be beneficial to new drivers like teenagers as well. The reason I say this is because a new driver needs to watch and see how to properly drive, if the new driver watched the basic skills of the driverless car, it may benefit him/her for when they star to drive independently. I think that with any type or design of vehicle procautions will have be taken into place and lots of research and factors will go into play. Many people are concerned about the liablities and if something would go wrong what they would do, who would be responsible. I believe that the damage and facts would have to be carefully examined, just like any car accident. With this being said, I think the rate of car accidents will decrease because there will not be any distractions for the driver in the car, and it will be quicker for the driver to be notified if something were to go array.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020! Is that not amazing? Think of all the new oppertunities and safety that we will have! Maybe it will make you feel less scared teaching your sixteen year old boy how to drive. It will decrease the rate of car accidents, benefit new drivers, and make drivers feel more safe in their vehicles. So, in 2020 will you be buying your first driverless car?",3,3,2,3,1,2,3,1,2
"The author of this story does not support the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. in this article, there is only evidence supporting all the challenges that venus brings to us. The author gave no reason or claim to why a dangerous trip to venus would benefit us in any way. The author of this article does include evidence and facts about how hard it would be to get to Venus and all the challenges we would have to undergo to get to Venus.

In this article the author claims that going to Venus is hard but worthy. What makes Venus so worthy? ""often referred to as earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of denisty and size."" says the article of this passage in paragraph 2. but then in paragraph 2 he states that Venus has a ""thick atmoshpere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfiric acid"" ""temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and "" atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The author gave all this evidence of the challenges we were facing to get to venus but he does not say why it is beneficial to us. he gives us more reasons to not want to go to venus.

in conclusion, this author does not support his claim of venus being worthy despite all the dangers and challenges it brings. There is no text evidence or even a reason to go to venus. the author has to include more of the benefits we can get from going to venus, instead of giving us all the challenges.",1,4,3,3,1,2,1,3,2
"The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/she provides excellent evidence and data to support his/her claim. The auhor's reason as to why he/she wants to study Venus is because Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus.

The author uses the evidence that Venus is the most Earth-like planet because Venus has some features close to Earth. The reasoning is that, from paragraph four, Venus has a rocky surface that has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This is great evidence because it helps prove the point that Venus was a planet like Earth and that connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author uses the evidence that NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus because NASA has a project that will allow scientists to float above Venus. The author's reasoning is that, in paragraph five, NASA came up with the idea of a vehicle hovering over Venus and it will allow the scientists to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. This is great evidence because it will prove that scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus, which connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author supports the idea of studying Venus well because he/she provides excellent evidence and data to support his/her claim, which the evidence is that Venus is the most Earth-like planet and The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has an idea to send humans to Venus. The author adds great reasoning to that evidence which proves points that support the idea that Venus is worth studying; Venus was a planet like Earth and scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus. Because of the points that Venus was a planet like Earth and scientists do not need to get harmed in order to study Venus, it proves that Venus is a planet worth studying.",3,4,3,4,2,2,1,2,3
"Computer-driven cars are a new and exciting thing for people to try, but it's not all fun and games when the driver looses focus due to the lack of awareness they have when not physically driving and controlling their own car. The freedom a computer-driven car gives allows the driver to not always pay attention or possibly fall asleep at the wheel.

I myself wouldn't feel very safe knowing that it was a computer and not a human driving the car in front of behind of me. I agree with lawmakers in most places stating, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" If the driver in the car is in control at all times that gives them no opportunies to fall short or not pay attention. The quote,""..they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of drvieweays or dealing with complicated traffic issues, sucha s navigating through roadwork or accidnets."" tells that the driver is alerted when there are complicated traffic issues. The driver becomes too dependent on the car to drive for them leading them to believe that they dont have much to do. It says that the drvier is alerted when pulling in and out of driveways, where a child could come out of no where on the sidewalk entering the driveway. The car may or may not pick the child up on its sensors quick enough, and the child could become badly injure, then the driver/manufactorer would have a lawsuit on their hands.

""The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" If the google car only announces when the driver needs to take over, what if there was a deaf person in the drivers seat? Or someone blasting their music loud enough to the point where they were unable to hear the announcement? That person wouldn't hear them leading them to not know when to take over, which could result in a life being lost.

""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" The technology used in the cars are no gurarentee and fail at any moment. Someone could be entering a working area and the car may break down on them right then and there. If there is any possibily that the car could shut down or stop working it's not a safe object to be on the road.

The fact that the drivers become more dependent on the technology of the cars than themseves allows the driver to be unaware of their surroundings. The safety of others (pedestrians) is compromised with computer-based cars.",3,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,2
"Over the years people have advanced technology and produced new technology. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System. This software is a new software to detect the emotions from someone. This software can detect the emotions of a student when learning a lesson from a computer. I believe this new software is not as vaulable as it seems in the article for it to be in a classroom.

In my opinion, i think the Facial Action Coding System is not as valuable as it sounds as described on the article. If a teacher really wants to know the emotions of a student then just ask the student, using the new software on someone is not necessary.

In paragraph 6 it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", a computer analyzing your face to know your emotions without the permission of the student is kind of invasion of privacy. What if the student doesn't want the computer to recognize what the student is feeling. Also why have a computer teach a lesson when

for many years the teacher is always the one teaching in front of the class. If a student is confused, that student can just raise their hand and have the teacher help them right there or what if the student has a question, the Facial System is not going to know that the student has a question because it only recognizes emotion, it doesn't read your mind. Either way the emotions of a student is not going to matter when your learning, its not important to know someones emotion, the only thing that matters in a classroom is for the students to pay attention and learn from the teacher.

The Facial Action Coding System is also a waste of the schools money. In the short paragraph before the first paragraph it says, ""...applications for a variety of industries."" meaning that the people who made the software are of course selling the system to other industries. So that means they are also going to sell the system to the schools which im sure is a lot of money. Instead of schools wasting the money on that system they could be using that money for better lunches, computers, ipads, prom, etc.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system is not as valuable as it seems to be in the artical to be put in classroom computers. The new software is neither important nor necessary. The only important thing in a classroom is that the students pay attention and learn. If a student is confused they can just raise their hand and will get help and if the student is bored then there is nothing you can do, a student is always going to bored. And also the system is a waste of money when you buy other things way more important and is very necessary.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Using cars creates admissions that damages our ozone layer. Communities around the world know this and are doing something to relax the damage being done. They are doing temporary bans on cars along side with other cities, and trying to make cars with much lower emissions.

Using cars in major cities makes it so noisy but also makes it very bad for the environment, and ourselfs. When you live in a major city like for example New York City, people choose to walk rather than drive cars. Not only is this healthier for us but it is much more healthy for the rest of the environment.

In suburban Germany there is a town that has banned cars from the street completely and has most people riding bikes and walking. Most of these people dont really car so much about having to walk or ride a bike. In Colombia they had one day where they banned cars and in their city of 7 million people, most people walked or rode bikes. Germany and Paraguay arent the only nationd that are taking a part of this, other nations like France, and other eurpoean countries are joining in. President Obama has also pushed for cars with lower emissions and higher gas mileage. This will help save people money if they dont really have it, and help save the amount of gas used and emissions caused.

With all this in mind it would be useful to lower gas emissions or even to stop using cars in general. It will be healthy for us and the environent. We dont even have to get rid over cars completly either, we can just switch over to electric. Theses are easy solutions to our problem, and also giving us and advantage in the world we live in.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The passage ""Drivless Cars are Coming"" have negative and positives. I would say I am against dirivless cars. Why not use cars that we can drive ourselves? Are Drivless cars actually the safest? If you were to ask me those questions I would say we need to stay with the cars tan we can drive. I would also say driveless cars are not the safest.

If we continue to use the cars we use today we don't put our safety in a computer hands. I think we should stay accountable for our own safety and make our own decisions while driving. In the passage it states that in certain situation the car will alert the driver when he or she needs to take control. The thing about that is what if it doesn't alert the driver and the car keeps going and causes a car accident which can potentially kill people or put their lives in danger. Then it goes into a even bigger situation if the accident is on the driver or on the manufacturing company. It really could go either way but why even take the risk in putting your life in the hands of a computer.

What if a police car or the ambulance is coming and the car doesn't pull over to the side of the road to let them have a clear passage to get where they need to go? Now you can possibly go to jail, but wait is that on you or the manufacturing company. There will be a lot of sewing of company's and a lot of fights between the people of the driveless cars and company's. The thing is we the people have a chance to avoid all of this now if we just decide not to make or buy a driveless car. The question you have to ask yourself is will you put your safety in the hands of a driveless car or will you be accountable for your own saftey? It's your choice just make sure you make the right decision.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1
"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" the author talks a lot about how driveless cars could be a good thing and a bad thing. My thoughts on driveless cars are negitive. My thoughts are only negitive because anything could go wrong.

One of my thoughts on driveless cars are what if you have to suddenly stop in an unknown place how whould the car know it has to stop. A driveless car could be or maybe would be the cause of most car accidents. Everyone wouldnt even know how to work it because we wernt born with it. It would maybe be a great technology but most people wouldnt be confortable doing or not doing something they havent did all their lifes.

Another one of my thoughts on driveless cars is when i think about a driveless car i think about all technology and there isnt a 100% chance that there wont be a malfunction. Most technology makes mistakes of has some type of glitch, so why would you put your life in the hands of a driveless car.

On earth, people are becoming lazier as the day goes by all the technology we have barely makes us want to move off of our couches. Which would also be another negitive thought about driveless cars.",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Facial action coding system is the future of reading emotions. I think that using this technology in classrooms would be very valuable. We could find what the students like. We could get everyones opinion easier. We could have unweighted test, kids wouldnt need to change their answers based on their friends. So i think that using this facial action coding system would be good for the school.

Using this system could help us learn what students like. For example if they play a series of ads we could moniter their facial expressions after each ad. Also we could find what the students like to read about, for example if the kids are reading some text they may smile when they think its good. Using this system would help alot to figure our students out.

Using this system woud also help us get information easier. we could get kids to use it but like alot of them at the same time and it would be easier than just having you question them one by one. The system would be more efficient and effective. They can record the data and run it in a chart to find what kids refer in a larger scale but it would be fater and more accurate than questioning them one by one without the system. The system would help out the school by letting them do this much faster.

If schools used the system then kids wouldnt have to lie. kids wouldnt really be able to lie cause the system can recongnize wha they are thinking and how they are feeling. Kids wouldnt change their answer becasue of what theryre friends picked. They cant really change their facial expressons at first. you react how you react You react how you feel.

In conclusion I think that using this system at schools would really help the school. it would help the students, it would help everyone. Students could be honest and it would be alot more accuarte. so system is a yes.",2,4,1,3,0,1,1,1,1

First of all the face on mars is just what is sound like, a form in mars' land that looks like a face. It was first seen in 1976 by NASA's high-resolution images and 3D altimerty. In 1998-2001 it has gone though some major changes. It is a odd thing indeed.

I beleive the was just a huge rock formation. This was not make by aliens. We humans have not fount any finint prove of aliens. So fromma sciences stand point i belevie that this is just a rock that looks like a face.

In conclution i think that

this was not make by aliens. For now we humans have yet to find prove that alien are real. So by science this is just a rock formation not thw work of aliens",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I honestly think that having driverless cars are not a very smart idea. i mean, how will kids know that our generation use to manually drive around with our hands and feet. Also the enjoyment we had doing so.

The google cars they have made that are able to drive on their own can make a human being lazy beacuse the driver would be effortless to drive around and could let their car drive. People can talk about how drivers can fall asleep while manually driving. But how about these google cars? They said in the article that a google car can drive on its own , BUT it can still alert the driver to take control of the car when its around complicated traffic , such as navigating through roadworks or accidents. If the google car was meant to be driverless it would not have to alert the driver to take control in situations it was built and designed for. So the driver should not be alerted to do such a thing. I think we should keep driving the way we are today. Drivers are more focused driving themselves instead of being lazy , because no driver wants to get in an accident themselves. So they're more alert and have better drivning experience everyday they drive to a certain destination. Also the senors we have today are more enough because they alert us when another car is to close to us. We do not have to be alerted when to drive. I do think that we need better brakes that will not be worn out or broken. But instead people want to make driverless cars. How about making cars that dont have to run on gas or be to costly ? Indistructable tires? Car glass that don't break? Airbags that don't harm or knock people out? All of these harms and they are worried about how to establish a driverless car.

The car can alert you to take control, but what if you forget some of your driving expirence or get startled? Also what would happen if the car does not alert the driver? Can it alert the driving if the tires need more air pressur? Or an oil change ? I think that should be something to conern about the just making future drivers lazy to drive around. I honestly think that having driverless cars in the future are even more dangerous than the cars we use today.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"So, you have read the article Unmasking the Face on Mars, am i right? Well, I have some theories of my own, and I can assure you that Cydonia on mars, is not a face or anything extra-terrestrial.

My first reason as to why Cydonia on mars isnt a face is, well have you ever looked at the moon? Ever notice that when the moon if full, you see a face? Scientists in the past have been to the moon on investigations. While they were there they have proven that the face on the moon was just a bunch of craters. It is most likely that the face on mars is just creaters, or a mesa too.

My second reason is, things in outer space pictures are going to be a lot bigger than in reality. Take the sun for an example, we see the sun ten times smaller than it really is. If the sun was just as small as we presume it is, then how would planets, that are thousands of light years away, possibly get warm?

The final picture they took on April 5,1998, actually showed the Martain equivalent of a buttle or mesa. Buttles and mesas are landforms common around the American west. ""It reminds me most of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same hieght as the Face on Mars."" The Snake River in Idaho is basically evidence that Cydonia isnt really a face and that is was just a buttle, or mesa.

My third and final reason is, that all planets start off as a big ball of rock, meteors, and astroids that collide with each other. The possiblities of a ball of rock, a planet, having left over craters from all of the collisions, is very high. If, somewhere way far out in space, or even just one planet away, wouldn't we have had a lot more pictures, videos, and newspaper articles about aliens?

This is only three theories backed with evidence, and I'm sure that if you talk to any other of these wonderful scientists at NASA, that they can also provide more reasons with more evidence. Thus, I really hope that these reasons help you clearify that Cydonia is not a sign of Extra-Terrestrial activity.",2,4,1,2,1,1,1,2,1
"Imagine a world with a great transportation system that doesn't involve humans controlling the vehicles, yes, driverless cars. Sound futuristic? Yeah, but I think it could be better for us. The cars would have amazing technolgy, keeping us safer from human errors, because, let's face it, humans aren't perfect. We could take better care of our planet. And, no one would need to pay for another car, again.

The first reason we should have driverless cars, is because it is better for the planet. Google cofounder believes we could use driverless cars that would use half the fuel we use today. This would save fuel for future generations to come. Since we wouldn't be using as much fuel, there wouldn't be any concern of global warming. Think about your kids, your kids' kids, and so on. Do you want your grandkids to be suffering without any power source, or not even having a stable planet? No one wants that. Not only would driverless cars save our planet, they can help save lives.

Another reason we should have driverless cars, is because they can help save many human lives. These driverless cars would be computers, they can communicate to other driverless cars. And also, computers are perfect, they don't make mistakes. Humans, on the other hand, are not perfect. We make mistakes, it happens. So when a computer is driving a car, it would not make the mistakes humans do, therefore, saving hundreds of thousands of lives each year. These driverless cars would help save some money, as well.

The third reason we should have driverless cars, is because they would save a lot of money. No one would have to go out and fork out thousand of dollars on some new car. They could just use these driverless cars to transport them. Also, no one would have to pay for wrecks or insurance money, because these driverless cars wouldn't make mistakes to get them into car wrecks. We are looking at possibly of millions of dollars saved in just a year.

I think that having driverless cars would be a plus for society. They would save our planet, they are a lot safer, and they would save a lot of money. I don't know how soon this could be a",3,3,1,3,1,1,1,0,2
"Guessing how someone is feeling is hard sometimes which can make it difficult for people to connect with eachother. If we only knew someone's feelings, we could improve how we communicate with people and how productive we are.That can all change with the new technology that can read the emotional expressions of humans. The new technology called Facial Action Coding System, made by Prof. Thomas Huang, can change the lives of students drastically. The use of this technology is valuable in classrooms because it can make it easier for students to process information and keep the students engaged.

Students will be able to learn a lot with the help of FACS because of the way the information is displayed and taught. In paragraph 6 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it says "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" If a student was getting tired of the lesson, FACS could detect that the student is losing interest. So, it could change the format of the information and keep the student focused and keep going during the lesson. This will help students a lot on understanding the knowledge that is being given to them because not everyone learns the same way.

The emotions of humans can be hard to detect because most people don't want to verbally communicate or some don't know how to. Students can feel good or relieved if there is a lesson that is not stressing them out and that can actually make information more understandable. Also in paragraph 6 of the article, it says "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that too.' "" Some students may have trouble talking to teachers or asking questions about certain information. With FACS, they no longer have as much anxiety when learning which keeps the student from drifting off. The FACS will be able to keep the students engaged in the information because it is going into their head

more easily and it's less stressful.

Some might be against this innovative technology and argue that students might not learn as well or they might have a decrease in social and verbal skills. The thing is that it will help all students learn because everyone is different and the FACS will allow different students to be exposed to different formats of information. Since lessons could be modified, it will be more understandable for students to process given information. With FACS, students won't be as pressured and can actually be interested in the lessons because it is the best fit for them.

In conclusion, FACS is valuable for students because it will help them improve their understanding of new information and keep them interested. Thus, the FACS would also benefit their mental state because they are considering emotions of kids which could be hard to tell sometimes. FACS could be a new beginning for schools to improve education and engage students in lessons.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Is there such thing that a computer can define our emotions? How can a computer software define our emotions? Now in days, the technology is getting bigger as the years pass by people start to know even how to make a car drive by themselves that is one of the things we do not hear everyday. The computer sowftware that can define our emotionsis now that people use in work or even at school use.

Imagine the world with the computer software that can read our emotions that will be very amazing. For instance, you can probably not tell the emotions on somebody face when you see them they may be smiling right at you, but what if they are feeling another way you may never know what they are actually feeling that is why i think the computer software is a good idea to read people emotions. As the time goes by people are getting tired of showing the same feeling they might already started to think that they are not getting no where with what they are feeling. Of course, that everybody know how to describe what happy and sad looks like, but what if they are not feeling none of does emotions what if they are actually nervous or scared and there is no way that you can help them. The computer software stores alots of energy different kind of specific emotions that people can use to tell other people's emotions.

The calculation in the computer software in human perform is the same why that might be because, not everybody used it why we need to use it they may ask themselves and yes that is a good question well that is because that way you can even hlep yourself if you are smiling, but the results say a different thing for example, that you are sad in reality you can push your self to not be sad anymore that is one good way to see if you need to change your emotions.

Describing the computer software is not really hard to do it you can just say it shows us how you are really feeling even doe if you are smiling. They might get scared for the momnet but, that is one way also to help other people.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Venus exploration I can tell the author cares about venus by putting down many ways humans can exploer it from going there he says it was very worthy of going we would just need a blimp like vehicle too hover over 30 miles above the land becuse the surface of venuse is very hot just in the blimp hovering over 30 miles would be 170 dagrees but where the blimp is sitting its at sae levels on earth. They are finding out ways too make electronics go onto venus because there is a lot of danger if we put a human on venus 170 dagrees is too hot for the human body unless they got the blimp at freezing tempatures the people inside will burn righht up blood will boil and people will get heat strokes. But if we put electronicson the planet that can survive the tempatures we might not have a problem with people being burned alive and we could actually exploer the lands of Venus we could make vheacles out of strong silicone for this mission it would be easier too make vehicle out of the stuff.,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The author uses a lot of clear evidence to discribe how the scientists are tring to study Venus. Also, the author discribes the dangers of doing so. The author also tells us what the problems are with studing Venus. The real question is, is it really worth it?

One of the biggest problems with exploring Venus is that Venuses aptnosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide and the timperatures average over 800 degrees. Another problem is that the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. Also Venus is some times mistaken for a star because the plannet is so bright.

At one point Venus would have had features just like earth and have water surounding it. Venus is also known as the the twin to earth because they are so similar in features. NASA would send shipes into space and go to Venus but they could never lang on Venus. They haven't had a succesful space travel to Venus in 30 years. NASA is thinking about sending a blimp like craft to venus and have it hover over Venus at like 30 miles off the ground. Even at 30 miles off the ground the tempurtures will be around 170 Fahrenheit.

With what the passage states it is safe to say that there are a lot of dangers NASA would have to address before they launch another space ship to Venus. But also there are a lot of possibilities that NASA has when they launch the space ship to Venus. NASA can be the ones who discovered Venus, also they could learn more about Venus and why it lost all its earth like features.

In conclusion, the idea of learning more about Venus is a great opportunity to learn more about the planets around us. Also, learning about how Venus lost the Earth like features is a good way to learn about our planet and how to keep Earth from becoming that way. This idea of risking everything to go and explore Venus is a great opprtunity for us at earth to learn about how other planets like ours were destroyed.",2,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"As a teen you wanted to drive.  You wanted that freedom to go anywhere on your own.  When we are young we dont relize the damage driving a car does to our world.  It effects green house gasses, and C02 levels.  In my opinion it also makes the human race lazier, or less athletic you could say.  I'm a high school student, and to be honest I still want to be able to drive.  But with limitation.  I live about at most 3 miles from every place I need to go daily.  Theres thift shops, Family Dollar and game stores within a mile of my home,  and a 7-11 not much farther, Theres also a Naborhood Wall-Mart in 3 miles.  The only place thats not in walking distance is school, and I just take the bus.  My Mom daily drives to atleast one of these, I dissagree with that.  Everytime I go walk with my 3 younger sisters, we go down nd have fun.  While yes our feet hurt later, its still worth it.

""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneer, going where few soccer moms or commutin executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars.""  In Vauban any street parking is forbidden, along with driveway and garage parking.  They are what you would call a ""car-free"" suburban area.  While you can own a car, there are only two places to park on the edge of the development and it charges a rediculious fee to park there.  Due to this 70% of Families there don't own a car.  ""When I had a car I was allways tense.  I'm much happier this way,""  Said Heidrun Walter a mother who moved their with her family.  They got lots of positive feedback from families in the development.

Are we Americans causing most of our issues with gasses from cars?  Luckily no.  ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.""  As said by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the writer of the passage ""The End of Car Culture"" which go's into whether car numbers are increasing or decreasing, and whats in the future for it.  She says that it seems like America has gone down, and pasted the peak on cars.  While you might counter, ""Thats just the economy effecting how everyone spends their money and cars werent at the top.""  But people who stopped because of the recession may have no reason to restart that habit.

Biking, A healthy way to transport your self from one place to another.  It keeps you fit, more active.  Alot of issues with people today is if they are over weight or not.  While I'm not saying that just because your thin that your healthy.  If you dont exercise or eat well you aren't.  To be Healthy and fit also doesnt mean body builder extremes.  All I'm saying is as a person being healthy is easy, we just make it hard.  When you see that donut instead of the carrot.  or the couch instead of the bike.  It seems like an ultimatum that our mind invents.  When in reality we can have both.  If everyone had to walk places it would make that mind oggling ultimatum easier.  Forcing us to walk more instead of drive everwhere would make couch and donut time more aceptible.

Everyone wants to drive, with the freedom of going anywhere.  I know the feeling.  But overall we over drive, even if the amount has lowered.  It's no secret that it effects our town, our country, our world with C02 levels rising.  I'm notsaying lets get rid of cars completely.  But if everyonce in a while before you pick up your keys to go down to the near by 7-11, take a moment and set down your keys and walk.",2,2,2,2,0,0,1,2,1
"Do you think that reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I think that it can be a good idea if used properly because if the system can detect how someone is feeling it can adept to the person emotions and make it more intresting or entertaining for the student. This is good because this will help students stay on task with whatever their doingin class. But the only problem i could see with this is some students probably would not want system knwoing how they feel. This could bother the student even more or maybe the system would not even have an effect on certain student's emotions.

But i belieave it would be good to have something like this for exmaple the passage say's ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. I thinks is a good exaple because he say's if the student is happy of what he is being shown the computer would continue to do similar things to keep the student going. Also if the computer detect's if the student's makes a frown it would continue to change and adept to the student intill he or she shows signs of change or entertainment.

Another supporting detail is that the computer can also recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. I think this is really important because not all students would learn at the same paste. An if the computer can dectect this and help the student this is really helpful because some students or shy or don't know how to ask for help when confused on something. Having the computer detect when a student is bored is good becuase it could change the way infromations is being brought up and make it more useful and entertaining for student's. This would help them remain on task as well as help them learn even more.

My last reason why i belieave this would be a good choose is the way it can change the students mood. Imagine if a student all day was feeling sad/mad about something during school then they go on the computer and it changes its way of teaching to appeal to the student. This is really good because if that makes the student happier they would most likey but more in the mood for school. An example form the text is that ""(Putting on a happy face""actually works!) A reowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Empathy(feeling someone else's emotional sate) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

So in conclusion i do belieave that having a system that can read student's emotions is a good idea. I Belieave this because the way it can change so quickly to help a student. As well as it can determine if a reader is bored or if he/she is enterained .Overall i think it would help student's improve as well as stay on task. But this is what i belieave do you think that reading the emotional expressions of a student is a good idea?",3,3,3,2,0,0,1,2,1
"In the story of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ Venus is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky, It´s also the second planet from our sun. From earth people can see Venus from a safe distance. The Earth has a planet that is closer to it and it´s called Venus. Earth and Veus are often referred as twins. Venus has blanets of thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide. The more challengeinng about Venus´s atmosphere is that it has highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Venus has a average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it´s pressure is 90 times greater in the atospheric. Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian additional impediments weather like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. If Venus is so inhospitable, why the scientists are discussing further visit to the surface. Astronomers thinks that Venus was probably covered with largely oceans and could have supported various forms of life ,just like Earth. Venus surface has rocky sediment and familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus surface at thirty-plus miles, its temperature would be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit. but its air pressure would be close to match the Earth´s sea level. The Earth´s solor power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on its level. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, form a distance. Therefore, scientists are seeking to start a conduct mission to understand Venus.

"Technology in modern day is advancing in leaps and bounds, and one of the areas people are most interested in is transportation. People are constantly looking to make their commute faster, easier, and more fun. Safety is a main concern for many, and society is looking to create fatality-free roads. As such, driverless cars are the ultimate goal for our society. There are many pros and cons to such a thing, and the risks far outnumber the gain at least for the time being.

Many poeple argue that automated cars would be safer than a human driver. People are subject to risks such as distraction, drunk driving, and human error while machines are immune to such ailments. An automated car can safely navigate under certain conditions, and when a threat is apparent that the car cannot handle on its own, a human can take over. For several years, cars have been built with systems such as automatic brakes and other automated features that can assist the driver or fully take over the car. Traction control brakes sense when a car is sliding and stop it even if the person behind the wheel doesn't realize that they are in danger. With successful technology like this, people assume that making cars fully automatic would increase the safety. People would even get the chance to relax while in the car. Trips that formerly took a week or more could be made in days if the car could drive itself while the human driver slept. It would also be possible for people to do things such as work or watch television while in the car, things that previously would cause incredible danger.

While there are many benefits to fully automated cars, there are also risks that come with the technology. First of all, the technology does not even exist yet, and it is unclear when it will. For now, cars are only partially automated and fully automated cars would need a certain set of requirements to be met in order to function properly and safely. The amount of sensors needed to achieve full automation is astounding. It would take several different kinds of sensors including cameras, radar, and many more. Some of these need magnets or radio signals while on the road to function, so if an anomaly occured that put them out of commission, things could go terribly wrong. The cost of such things is incredibly high. The car in and of itself would cost much more than the same model without automation. Tax payers would be required to pay for installing magnets or other feedback technology on roads so the cars would have enough information to function properly, and people could fall into debt for the luxury of an automated car.

In the year 2016, automated cars are a dream that is far too dangerous and costly to pursue. Years in the future, it may be an innovation bringing safety and comfort to hudreds of people, but in the present it is impossible. The cost of installing the necessary technology for such cars to function would delve too far into taxpayers' pocketbooks to be truly profitable, and the technology would need replaced every few years anyway. If something were to malfunction in just one car, it could cause mass chaos and death or injury to potentially hundreds of people. At this point in time, the technology has too much risk to be possible in the near future.",3,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,3
"would you have a drigerless care ? what if its not safe or something mouthfunctions on the car. google and a whole lot of car companys are thinking to make these driverless cars. But they really should not make these cars because in the generation we live in these cars are either going to cause many deaths due to the people that dont care about life. what if the car gets in the wrong hands that can mean multiple deaths. On top of the deaths these cars are going to be very expensive.

the county is already going through money problems as we speak so think if they bring these cars out. were going to go into a drought as a country people will want the cars so now there doing anything legal or illegal to get them. the cars also are not safe in paragraph 9 its telling me that if i buy one of these cars i could crash or anything can happen. Because google hasnt even put everything in place for safety of the car or driver. The state doesnt have laws for the car or cant even tell if we are at fault for crashing the car thats also in paragraph 9.

there are pluses

to this car though dont get me wrong. it may not be safe or proven to even drive by itself completly yet but the work that they are doing on it to upgrade it sounds nice. if we can have these cars up and running fully without any problems i might just look into it. for now i think they should work on getting more sensors in and on the car so it can be proven to drive with no driver helping park or go through busy streets.

my complete thoughts on this car is it looks and sounds nice. i would have one in 2020 if i get the chance to eperince it. but they have to fix how safe the car is because it sounds cool it can watch you to always make sure your not a careless driver and you can be in the car with your friends without having to drive or get tired.",2,1,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"What if i told you the computer you sit in front of everyday in school could read your emotions as you work,now I know this sounds but its true.

Its called the FACS(Facial Action Coding system)and i think it would be awsome if we had this level of technology in school. Dr Huang and his colleauges originally built this so they could find out how the lady in the mona lisa was feeling and they found out that she was 83% happy 9% disgusted 6%fearful and 2% angry. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is is bored or confused during a lesson and then using the FACS the computer modifys the questions so you arent so bored or makes the difficulty easier like a human instructor. The FACS constructs a 3d computer module of the face and all 44 major muscles in the module move like a human face and one muscle moves its called an action unit then the rest of the work is done by psychologists by classifying the emotion depending on the movements of your facial muscles.

I think it would be a great idea to have the FACS installed in school computer,I think it would improve working habits and motivate students to be more positive.",1,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time-consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost-broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Reuter's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogota, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month where cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antanas Mockus stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally as awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semi-trucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April of 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to ducment four. New York has a new bike-sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to acheive all of the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number-one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that yiou should look forward to; it's the journey.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"On May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars while taking photos of possible landing sites. As it was taking photos, it noticed a dome that resembled a human face. The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.

In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have came to the conclusion that there is life on mars only becuase they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.

In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.

In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Is studying Venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents? This planet is sometimes called the ""Evening Star."" Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is proved to be a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the fascination that Venus might have been Earth-like planet and that NASA has a particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

In paragraph 4, it shows how Venus might have been earth-like planet, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus has some features that are similar to those on Earth such as surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, given a long time of space travel. However, returning to Venus seems indisputable. The options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive to return to Venus is pretty challenging.

In paragraph 5, it shows how NASA has a particularly idea for sending humans, "" The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" The possible solutions is that the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. They are basically trying to create a vehicle that's hovering 30 or some miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Scientists are going to be hovering safely far above the planet it can only provide limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

However, while scientists are hovering above of Venus they will not be able to take samples of rocks, gases, or anything else, from a distance.

In conclusion, studying Venus is worthy. Venus might be challenging to study but researchers and scientists are trying to figure how we can study Venus. This planet has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity. So yes, studying Venus is worthy despite it's dangers.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"A Seagoing Cowboy's Journey

Imagine going to many sites that many people don't normally see and having mulitple adventures around the world. It is an unforrgetable experience that you don't want to miss. You should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program becasue of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and seeing the unquie sites.

First of all, having some freetime and playing some games onboard is simply a time to relax and enjoy the great experience. Many of you may say that the games don't matter. You just want to travel the world and save as much people as possible. Even though that may be true, I belive that the games benefit in many ways, like making new friends and just having some tine to relax. The cowboys and I have played baseball and volleyball in some empty holds where animals have been housed. Other things to do in your freetime could be reading, boxing, whittling, table-tennis, fencing, and so much more! It has helped me have a better time onboard.

Secondly, helping struggling individuals and families make you feel joyous inside. Some people may say that you don't want to help as many people and go enjoy the amazing sites and play games with fellow companions. And, helping people is really dangerous. But, I belive that if you do, it can make you a better person inside and out. And it doesn't just have to be people either; it can be animals too. Caring for the animals on the way to China kept me busy which was a good benefit because the trip to China took about a month. They had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. It helped me be more responsable and hard working. As for the struugling people, I helped people recover their food supplies, animals and more. The benefits were that same as those with the animals. The knowladge of helping someone or something is one of the best feelings in the world.

Lastly, touring the sites was the best thing for me to experience. Multiple people might say that they don't care about the sights and they just want to do something else. But, I believe that if I didn't see those wonderful sights, I wouldn't be determined or encouraged to finish my job as a Seagoing Cowboy. It was an unbeliveable opportunity for me and it will be for you. I was able to see Europe and China! Two things that were special to me were seeing the Acropolis in Greece and taking a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. In Italy, many of the streets are water, which made my experience to Italty even more exciting. On the way to China, I also marveled at the Panama Canal and toured an excavated castle in Crete.

In conclusion, you should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because of the fun-filled games and freetime, helping the struggling individuals and families, and finally, exploring the unquie and wonderful sights around the world. I am very grateful for the amazing opportunity and it made me more aware of people and their countire's needs. You should think about participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program today!",3,4,3,4,1,2,2,3,2
"A technology called the Facial Action Coding System is a software that allows computers to be able to recognize human emotions. Being able to detect how someone is feeling quite accurately. The use of this technology could be very valuable for students during class. Identifying how a student is feeling about a topic, seeing if they're being truthful to questions, and to be able to see how a student is actually feeling emotional wise.

First, this system would allow teachers to be able to see how well they're students feel towards a topic. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored'"" ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The detection from the software would help out teachers to understand, which students are lost or which students don't have any interest in learning. Which allows the teachers to either change up the lesson or find another instructor to teach the student.

Secondly, it would allow teachers to be able to see if a student is being truthful or not. ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth."" ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a differnt muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would give teachers the oppurtunity to see if specific students are lying about understanding a topic and if they actually did their homework or not. If a student were to lie about understanding a topic, the teacher could help them out. Also some students get away with lying about homework or other things. So this would allow teachers to either give more time to a student or give them their rightful score.

Lastly, teachers would be able to see how their students are actually feeling emotionally. ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" ""New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others."" Although students feelings should be kept private, trying to help out a student isn't harmful. Many students hide about how they're feeling or lie about it. So being able to detect how a student is actually feeling can allow the teacher to seek care or show sympathy.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding system would be quite valuable for students in a classroom. It would benefit teachers by allowing them to see how their students are feeling about the class, if they're lying about understanding something or something else, and how their students are actually feeling.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus. Also Venus is close so this can save time traveling to it and that we have to overcome challenges to get their but it is ultimately worth going.",4,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"The thing is that 25 years ago a face appeared on Mars. Nasa said that it looked like someone looking up through tha camera at them whcih is very creepy. Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority says, says the article.

Don't get me wrong I do think that it is just a normal landfrom but, if you really look at it then it actually isnt a regular landfrom. To me it looks like the shadows on mars are creeping up on the mass of rock or sand or whatever it is. Like the scientists said the creeping up shadows is what gave the landform a the eyes the mouth and the nose.

But, this face they say is actually called a mesa. From all the years it has went through such as 1976 to 2001 I would say that the face is now older and deformed. The article says what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Gavin. They also says it's not easy to target Cynodia.

So when people say that the face is an actual face they are wrong becaus e if they would actually read a article on the mesa/face . They would see that they are not right at all they are just wrong. Beacus ethe shadows are what gave the massive the landform the eyes and the mouth and the nose. Remembe rthis they first discovered it in 1976 , and they kept on lokking at throughout the years. I think that it was an awesome thing to discover.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Although the usage of motorized vehicles such as cars and motorcycles still remains at large, there is a significant amount of the global population that have realized the advantages of limited automobile usage. Cars and other diesel or gasoline dependant vehicles emit large amounts of greenhouse gases, which eventually lead to the progression of global warming. Not only this, but whether we notice it or not, cars and the spaces that are required to house cars take up valuable space that we can use for agriculture, the stimulation of the economy through the purchase of goods, even for progression of our education. The using of motorized vehicles is not something that should be banned by suburban life, but it, -like its predecessor the transportation means by horse hauling- has started to become obsolete.

As shown by Vauban, Germany, a community in which the usage of cars is virtually nonexistant, the extinction of car usage is something to be welcomed; like a weight being lifted off the responsible shoulders of your average driver. Driving is not only a what is now viewed as a necessary activity for daily living, but it is also a hazardous chore that we as common citizens must place on ourselves on a borderline daily basis. When driving, we are subjecting our safety to the hands of chance, leaving our lives suseptible to being taken from us by an irresponsible driver, someone who we will most likely never cross paths with again.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,""

says a member of the car-free community Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. Aside from health related deaths, death by car accident is not something that is unheard of, it is actually one of the top theives of life found in the United States alone. It is estimated that a death of a teenager (ages 16-20) resulting from a car accident happens every 16 seconds. Without cars to drive, there would be no way these accidents may occur.

Within the last century, the rate of global warming has skyrocketed in an almost terrifying way. The natural process that would normally take several millenia to take place without the interference made by humans has been nearly cut by three-quarters with the technological advancements that we as a species have made. In three of the four sources, it has shown that the emissions made by fossil fuel dependant vehicles have been the biggest contribution to the advancement of global warming. It is even shown in the article written by Robert Duffer that even a partial ban of car usage in Paris was able to reduce the amounts of smog there significantly.

In two of the articles, it has been shown that with the reduction of car usage, the space that was once consumed completely by these motorized psychological traps can be used to further flourish our enviornment with shopping malls, schools, parks and health centers that are readily available to us. Although we may not notice on a regular basis, but the amount of space that is used to give drivers a place to drive and to give cars a place to inhabit is more than likely bigger than the amount of space that we give an average citizen to live in. In Vauban, Germany 5,500 residents are able to live within a rectangular square mile, whereas a majority of that space in a place like Miami, Florida would be made vacant in terms of living, but prosperous in terms of space taken up by cars. In Bagota, Columbia as a result from their yearly ""Car-free day"" has increased their amount of publicly availabel park and sports center, and have also improved the sidewalks that are readily available to its citizens.

Physical activity has always been promoted, since we were small children who are incapable of driving. Some would say that we were conditioned to view exercise as the best alternative to driving, and it turns out that our conditioning has been proven as fruitful. Within the last several years, the amount of miles driven per person has decreased by nine percent as shown in the article written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the amount of those looking to receive their driver's liscense has also decreased. This is not because the generation of millenials has viewed driving as something not to their interest, but because we are conditioned to not want to partake in it. Even if our conditioning was not intentional, it has proven fruitful in terms of the improvement of our awareness of both human lives and the enviornment. Both cars and driving are making their way to ineffeciency, and that is not a bad thing. The lack of cars on the road is something to look forward to, both for our ability to look forward to new technological advancements in transportation and for our longevity as a species.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents many positive aspects of driverless cars that should be noticed. The pros greatly outway the cons in the agument of whether driverless cars are beneficial or not. Every con that was mentioned in the article was over the topics of laws, liability, and how ""driverless"" the cars really were. These arguements are extremely miniscule when placed next to the big picture.

Throughout the article, the author points out the most important fact of driverless cars; they are a safer option to driving. In a world where accidents happen all the time, it is our job to lessen the frequency of these accidents. In paragraphy 2, the author expresses that cars that were developed by Google in 2009 were able to drive for more than half a million miles without a crash, which is groundbreaking. If this innovation makes it so that people are just slightly more safe and protected, then it should be used. Businesses and companies have already been putting time and money into these feats in automation, so there is no harm in them finishing their work. In paragraph 10, it is said that many companies have already predicted when they will be able to distribute driverless cars, so let's promote these companies and their word.

There are no consequences to developing these technologies, only consequences in not doing anything. It would be a shame to see something that could benefit every single person and their safety go to waste or not be sought out. Anyone that cares about the safety of themsleves and others should want this innovation implymented into society. There is nothing in the world that should be more important to a good parent than the safety of their child.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"There are planets that we all are curious about, but with curiousity comes danger. Challenging ourselves with exploring with Venus is a risk but it's a risk that we might take. Astronomers are intreged that Venus once have been a Earth-like place before and includes familiar features like earth. Also Exploring Venus may be exciting but also dangerous because of it thick atmosphere of 97% of carbon dioxide and it temperture average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. With that being said, it's worthy of studying despite the dangers it presents.

Astronomers are intreged that Venus once have been a Earth-like place before.

Years ago, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" As it sates in Paragrapgh 4,sentence 3. Venus might be like mars because Venus might be worthy of living but we won't know for sure if scienists don't study the planet.

Another reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents because it includes familiar feature like earth. If Venus once had familiar features,then it was probably suitable for forms of life. In the article, paragragh 4,sentence 4 states ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Eath"" Also in paragapgh 4 sentence 5 states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar feaatures such as valleys, mountains and craters.""

It may be worth studying but it comes with dangers such as Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% of carbon dioxide. A human being could handle so little of carbon dioxide because its toxic to bodies. Also,it's clouds has sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In the article, in paragrapgh 3 sentence 1 states ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" Also in paragraph 3,sentence 2 sates ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid Venus's atmosphere.""

Another reason why it be might be dangerous, if the scientists decide to study the planet is because of the temperture of being 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Even though if a human being can't step a foot on Venus, it can send a special meachine that can withstand that temperture. In the article it states in paragraph 3, setence 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"""The Face"" Is Not A Face

The 1998 dicovery of, the Face has gotten its fair share of publicity throughout numerous years. This photo that was taken on NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This ""face"" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars.

First, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" even says,""it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn't mean it really was.

Also, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, ""Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!"" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.

Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this ""face"" and captioned it, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.

You might be thinking,"" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual."" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.

In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The author of "" The challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author did not support the idea of that. The author gives information on how Venus is a dangerous place to got to, for humans, but not so much on why it is not dangerous and it being a worthy pursuit. As said in paragraph 1 "" While Venus is simple to see from the distance but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"". The author gave information on why pursuiting Venus would be not worthy.

In paragraph 2 the author stated "" Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for mor than a few hours"". That statements is supporting that Venus is not worthy of pursuiting, where the author does not support his claim. The author gave information on the dangers of Venus and not the good things that'll take place by visiting Venus. Also stated in paragraph 3 "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth..."" stated by the author. The author gave more information onto why pursuiting Venus is dangerous, the conditons on Venus is moe dangerous compared to the ones on earth. The author is not supporting his claim in that statement eitheir, he is opposing it.

My claim is the author is not supporting his caim onto why Venus is worthy of pursuiting, the author is saying why its not. "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itslef, but

also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". As stated by the author, the author is saying that trying to meet the challenge that Venus is presenting is dangerous. So in conclusion the author of "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did not support his claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"I belive that the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) would be good to use in school because like it says in the article a teacher would know when a student is bored, and they could change the lesson up a little bit, to make it more interseting. It seems like it would be a good tool to use in school.

The Facs could help students who dont normally ask the teacher for help get help. The system could recognize if a student was lost or confused on the thing they're working on. The teacher could then go to that student and help them with that problem they are on, and it might lead to them asking questions in the future because they might feel comfortable asking that teacher for help. It could also help guidance counsolers find the depressed or mad kids, and help them with their problems. The machine knows your mixed emotions which is great because a student might look like they get the problem they're working on, but really they need help and the teacher can recognize that , and get the tudent the help they need on it. It's pretty cool that a computer can consturct a 3-D model of your face, and to get all 44 facial muscles to move along with it.

In conclusion the FACS would be very helpful to schools but it's probally very expensive, but i'm sure if someone were to make a claim to a school board committe, the committe would find funding for it if enough people were on board with it. This machine would help in school by knowing how the students feel while they're at school, and knowing what students understand, and don't understand can help the teachers change up the lessons for their future students they teach.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,1
"Cars are an easier form of transportation and can benefit anyone that knows how to drive. The use of cars in the United States is bigger than the use of cars in any other country. On the other side of the world mostly in Europe and also South America they are trying to get rid of cars because of many different reasons. Cars can be beneficial but they can also harm us. Everybody thinks that cars can be helpful if an emergency happens and yes that is right but the pollution of cars can also harm nature and mess with the air we breathe and it can lead to everyone dying slowly.

Take Germany for example. In the German Suburbs they are going completely car-less in a city called Vauben. Here, if you want to have a car, you need to either buy a space in a large garage for $40,000, along with a home or you can just move out. They are trying to make the streets better by improving them and all cars do is harm everything. In this city, 70 percent of families don't own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move here. All you hear in this city are bikes and people talking which drowns out the car noises in the far cities. Now lets take a plane to Paris and see what goes on there. In Paris, France there has been a ban in driving cars and whoever disobeyed this law was going to be fined 22 euros. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to this fine. All of this happened because of the smog coming from Beijing, China. The warm days and cold night caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and diesel fuel was blamed. Paris normally has lots of smog, but this time they decided to get rid of the cars which make the smog worse. Public transportation was free of cahrge because of how many people had to leave their cars. Since the smog cleared up after a couple days, they unbanned some of the cars.

Bogota, Colombia has a car-free day every year. This has been going on for 3 years now due to the fact that cas are polluting too much air. The only thing people could use were bikes, buses and taxis. The goal for them is to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation. The violators were fined $25. The rain wouldn't stop and that was an excellent way to take away stress and lower air pollution. This year, two other Colombian cities joined the event. This also promotes broad and smooth sidewalks for people to walk on. In the United States, just a little above Colombia, President Obama says that we might go car free too since people are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. In New York the bike-sharing program reflect there new priorities. People now a days would rather take a public transportation than buy a car, they don't even bother to get a drivers license anymore. Most people now actually like to walk and get some good exercise or just take a bicycle wherever they go. The number of car use by young people went down 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 which shows that young adults would prefer to walk or ride a bicycle wherever they go.

Overall, cars are being used everyday less and less and all this is mostly because of pollution. Not using a car can benefit us in many ways also. Walking is a good source of exercise for anyone and after a while you can even find yourself to be a little more fit than you used to. Riding a bicycle is also good for your health because it is another way of exercise and promotes a healthier body. The use of public transportation is only helpful if you go somewhere far that you can't exactly walk to or ride a bicycle to. The less gas-powered vehicles we uses, the less pollution we have and the healthier the air will be for us. Imagine living in a pollution-free place where the air is cleaner than ever, wouldn't that make you feel better? It can also stop many diseases from runnig through the air because of the dirty oxygen that  we breathe.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Dear Florida senator,

I think that we should keep the Electoral College vote system, because it is pretty much the same thing as election by popular vote. When you vote for your canidatate, you're voting for his electors. Then those electors vote for their presidential nominee. Not often do the electors betray their canidate, so odds are the popular vote will win.

Also, the Electoral College system avoids run-off elections when no canidate wins a majority of the votes, the Electoral college produces a clear winner.

Another reason to keep the Electoral College vote is because if we had to vote by popular vote, it wouldn't be fair to some of the states. Canidates tend to visit the big states that have an impact on their election. That means that the states with a lower population don't get to see what the canidates have to offer.

Next reason is because some of the presidential canidates could be favored by some of the regions. For example, obama was elected as first African American president, and a lot of African Americans were excited, and voted for him. Some of the people didn't even care what he had to offer. The Electoral College reduces the chance of that happening because the regions vote doesn't have a big impact on the election.

Lastly, we should keep this voting system because when the citizens vote for a presidential canidate, they vote for the electors. They choose electors that are going to vote for the party's nominee. So basically, if one of the canidates wins the popular vote, and the electors go to vote, the one with the more popular votes is going to win most likely. It rarley ever happens that the elector for one nominee votes for the other.

I believe we should keep Electoral College vote because it is much like election by popular vote. It is also more fair between big and small populations of states, and presidential canidates can not be favored by regions they come from. The Electoral College system is a good way to vote.

Sincerely PROPER_NAME, American citizen.",2,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The ""Face on Mars"" had been something that fascinated Scientist's at Nasa and conspiracy therorists alike. With the publication of the pictures, it brought up the question: Was it made by aliens? No, it was not, in fact it was just a nautral land form.

The first picture of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken by Viking 1 spacecraft. It was looking for a landing spot for its sister ship, then made out the shadowy aperance of a face. While this did shock scientists, it didn't last. They put down as just another Martian landform, it's only special charateristic being it looked like a ancient egyptian pharoah. Later the Mars Global Surveyor took another snapshot, the picture being ten times sharper than the orginal. To reveal nothing but a nautral land form. It was actually a mesa, a land form or lava dome.

The ""Face on Mars"" was not alien monument or even an actual face. It was a bunch of shadows and just in general a low pixelated picture.",1,3,3,3,0,1,2,1,0
"I really like the fact technology has changed over time by smart people who have the time and committment to make our community a better place. It is really hard to tell emtion sometimes. There's sometimes people who have a relaxed face, but is happy. I totally agree with the computer technology to tell emotion for paintings and illustrations. Although, I wouldnt recommend using it on students maybe for some people, but not for all. Certain students could take that very personal like ""invading their privacy"" situation type, but I certaintly wouldn't use it on students.

Constructing a 3-D model of the face of a painting or illustration I could understand that, but having the audacity to invade someones space would be a totally different story, when you could just ask them about their problems or just to even check up on them. Severall of students could take in the process personal, beause they might not want people to know that they're upset or angry only for the simple fact people can go and spread your business, or maybe they don't want to talk.

Permission of using it on students also matters. You're not just going to walk up to any person, take a picture of them, and then run away with it. Something is going to be said. The technology of it is so cool, but personally used on students, The professors and any other users have got to be out of their minds to use it for such reasoning on students. Realizing expressions throughout other humans are very common, only because we know what the emotions of sad, happy, excited, scared look like. We can tell when there's something wrong, because that's just our humanly instincts.

Supporting my evidence as to ""Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""Some computers need to understand that too."" I totally disgaree with that though computers shouldn't know all personal information on how which and who feels some kind of way when you can talk out their problems. They don't have to have a happy face to be happy, or a sad face to be sad. There are people who hide their feelings deep down inside faking their emotion on the outside. A lot of things you can't just ""up and tell"" human instincts don't work like that.

Came to thought that all technology is not meant for human interactions. Again, invading space just is not healthy or right for other people. Some may want to be left alone, not bothered with. Especially without permission. Things could change within the matter of seconds. Emotions are so common eve with the looks on their face, but there are going to be a lot times where other people hide them. Personal things just shouldn't be shared or forced on someone. No permission, not to be bothered with. Want to be alone? Leave them. Space is important.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,1
"Dear dumb Republican ,

The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it.  I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.

The first reason for why I despise this system is because we have had people with more than half of the country voting for them not be elected President.  This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes.  If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes.  In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President.  This happened during the Presidental Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President.  It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.

With the Electoral College it is more likely that a tie will happen.  This is beacuse there are only 538 electoral votes, which is a lot less than 300 million popular votes, for every U.S. citizen.  If there is a tie, then the Senate and House of Representatives has to do all this stupid stuff to figure out who wins.

In the process of the Electoral College, the voters in the smaller states are given more power than those in the larger states.  Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depeding on the size of the state's population.  WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do.  Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.

Because of the Electoral College, Presidential Canidates spend a large portion of their time in ""Swing States,"" like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes.  A swing state is a state that could go either way in the election, so the canidates spend a lot of time convincing it's populants to vote for them, because of the winner-takes-all method.  This is unfair to the states with predicted outcomes.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is old, useless, irrational, and hurtful to our country.  This is why we should abolish it.",3,4,2,3,1,1,2,1,2
"For the past two decades we as citizens have been trying to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, with little or no change. A major conductor of greenhouse gases would be automoblies also known as cars. For example France, cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel made up 67 percent of vehicles in France, which was blamed for causing five-days of intensifying smog that rivaled even Beijing, China; Which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.

In an article ""

Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, It tells about Vauban, a town occupied with 5,500 residents in Germany where locals have given up their cars. Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district and Vauban's streets are completely ""car-free"" except the main thoroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter a local resident of the town.

Vauban serves as a great example on how the majority of world should be. The time to take action is now. Reducing car usage can benefit the world around us globally, less pollution equals a cleaner world we live in meaning a better environment. Things like ""A day without a car"" should be global holiday. In ""

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

"" by Andrew Selsky it describes how Bogota, Colombia had a day without cars that helped promote alternative transportation and reduce smog.

Cars are the main source of greenhouse gas emissions and need to be put on a limit.

They produce pollution that is not only bad for the earth, but bad for our health as well. A solution to reduce cars emissions is having holidays in which no one can use cars and use other forms of transportation like bus or bike. It is important that we take action and aim for a better, cleaner tomorrow.",1,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In the article the author believes that we need to try to see more of Venus, however, going to Venus is very dangerous. Many people believe that the trip to Venus would be too dangerous given the real dangers on the planet. The author gives us both sides of the argument as to if we should keep trying to go to Venus or if we need to stop and focus our time on something less dangerous. We do have the chance to see what Venus holds because of the technology we have in todays world. It would be a very major accomplishment if we could get a person to land on Venus.

Venus is a dangerous planet, we do not know what is under the ""carbon dioxide blankets"". The author of this article says that although Venus is 97% covered in a thick atmosphere, we still hve a chance to see what is under it. One way the author included was to send a hovering vehicle to Venus and have it take pictures of the planet 30 miles abover the land. Although they do say that because of the thick carbon dioxide you would not see anyhting because the lights we have will more than likly will not be bright enough. Yet the author still believes there is a soultion to that problem and all the other ones I might add.

At the end of paragraph 5 the author says ""Not easy conditions, but suriviable for humans."" you see the author says that it is ""around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure is close to sea level on Earth "" and it seems unlikly for a person to be able to handle the 170 degree heat let alone the air pressure. Then the author goes on to tell us that we can use a hovering car, still it is a good idea but again the pictures would not be clear at all, which would defete the idea of a hovering car. There are many good and bad things about sending things up to try and get a look at Venus, and the author seems to think there is more good than bad. They do tell us that NASA is working on taking new approches to study Venus, like he said "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chos of Venus"" and if that is true then we may be taking a step in the right direction.

Winding down the author says that "" striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase human curiosity will likly lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" this quote proves that we are going to want to try and see more planets but if we can not get close enough to one of the closest planets around us, how are we supposed to get any further. The author makes many good points in this article, we should try to go to Venus, maybe not send a person up there right away, but we need to see what Venus has in store. The universe is bigger than just our solar system, if we can not even find a way to see Venus how are we going to go anywhere else. The author shows us both sides of the argument and the good that could come from going to Venus is just amazing. It could even be the greatest accomplishment in a long time.",3,2,2,2,1,1,1,2,1
".

Senator i believe the electoral college should be consider changed by congress because of the many people in this great country wouldnt trust electors for voting. I think every single confirmed vote should be counted and registered because that is the true meaning of voting for something or someone .Out of the 538 elector it would be a lie not to think one of them had a favorite or been bribed or rigged elections i think its hard to trust a bunch of men and women who a majority of the states no nothing about. Ialso think swing states should be considered like every other state there is instead of calling them ""toss-up states"" that anyone could over take .

Even as the text says Who are the electors, they can someone not holding a public State office, who picks them , and we cant even vote on who the electors should be.

The system is a disaster in it's self why are we taking a million public citizen votes and only letting one man or women ""Turn it in"" its non-democratic and it has no real use this off i completely disagree and do not feel that the electoral college is needed it seems like a waste of our U.S money and puts us in debt by paying these 538 people Tons of cash to vote on something a simple as Voting. now there is only one thing i believe is right in the voting system is that big state (size and population) does deserve the bigger ammount of electoral votes then smaller states like Florida, New York ,California ,Texas and many other states Since the population is so dense

By changing the voting system to popular vote i think makes people feel more involved in whats actually happening instead of just one measly vote. people complain about other people who dont vote well thats one of the reasons why 1 person out of a 4.5 million population state no one would care cause then those go right to the electoral college then thats what actually matters so at the end of the day people could careless who ran the nation. But at the end of the night anyone who knows about the electoral college wants it to be changed",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"My argument against ""Driverless Cars"" is that im going for it. The reason why is because we have advanced in our technology so it would only be wise to try and use that. Also because I think personally it could save many lives with its self brake instalation, self parking, and many other features. As I was reaing the artical it mentioned that the driver would have to still be alert because if theirs an accadent or workers ahead then the driver must be the one to avoid that. That dosent mean it a bad idea, it just means that maybe our technology isnt that advanced and cant avid things such as work sites ahead or accidnts. I think the reason they cant detect accidents is because you never know when ones going to happen, same with workers ahead your car may not be able to detect it because it could happen in a sudden flash. My position on driverless cars is that i think it will be a great idea. I like i said save many lives, know im not saying it will save everyones life but out o thousands it could decrease by hundred.

Appropriate details from the artical that supporst my position is when it talks about how it has automic brakes and self parking and many other features. Its great to have that type of things because as i ahve been saying it could save many lifes, and that important because no one wants to see their family dead. Self break is good because it could be late nd you have been working all day long and your tired and you fall asleep in the car right when a car is pulling out or your car turns a different direction and your close to hitting somethong and it just automatically stops. Or like most parents, you have a young child in the back and hes/shes crying andyou turn around for just a split secound and your car just comes to a complete stop. Then you realize you were about to hit a car infrount of you but with the self-breaking instalation you were able to save your life plus the ones you love riding in the back ( or front) and your car is safe ass well.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Do i think we should use this technology on students? Yes i think we should use this technology on students beacause then you might be able to prent fight suicide and more. Ithink its valuable because, if a student is going through a rough time and you use this program you would be able to fidout whats wrong and try to help them.

The other reason why it would be valuable is beause you can help students with bullyin to help them fom getting hurt and not wanting to continue their education due to mean people and neglagence. On top of that we can find out so much me about ur emotions if we were to san teenage minds going through adolesence because they are hanging constantly.

Therefore scanning our emotions will help us find out so much about the human phycological aspect with our emotions. With emotions once we figure out what makes up emotions we will probably mak a robot that can think and feel like a human.

See now the reason why itwouldnt be a good idea is beause it could stress the kids out and make their time worse in schools and in the public life. If we were to let a computerscan the teenagers emotions they might feel scared uncomfratable nd more and they might not do it.",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Why is is beneficial to have limited car usage? This is a question that has several answers varying from personal health, to economic gain, to enviromental gain. Though the car has been the symbol of the modern age, there seem to be few 'down-sides' to limiting the usage of these transportation units.

Cars have given mankind the ability to cross great distances in a short amount of time, allowing face to face communication, fast trade between companies and nations, and acess to medical and personal care otherwise out of reach. However, the car has also caused lack of mobility, cutting back on people's exercise as they no longer have to walk very far to get from point A to point B, the overwhelming responsibility and cost of owning a car has also put a mental strain on people, causing needless stress.  Of course there are places to go and things to do that require traveling large distances, and no one could be a expected to walk from New York to L.A., so car usage should not be utterly removed, but rather resricted.

So how do people properly regulate their car usage?  Several different governments and cities have debated this, trying different tactics and having varied results.  As shown in Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay,

""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars""

, we are shown the result of a community where 70% of the people do not own cars, but with no less activity than their counterparts in cities wheighed down by cars.  There seem to be several advantages in this city without  cars, one being that people seem to be happier.  Heidun Walter, a media trainer with two children informed Rosenthal, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"", the lack of cars seems to reduce stress, without restricting life.

So perhaps this is not enough reason for some to limit their usage of the car, alright, there are many more reasons why this is beneficail. One that is quite familiar to all is the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.  The majority of cars produce greenhouse gas emissions, polluting the enviroment and quickening the death of the planet, Rosenthal's essay ""

In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars,

"", we are told clearly that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gass emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. ""  This may seem like very little, but with the amount of cars in the world, these numbers add up to staggering damage to the enviroment.  Robert Duffer wrote an essay telling of these harmful effects in a shocking way: ""

Paris bans driving due to smog

"". This city had so much pollution that they had to ban the use of cars, ""Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London,"".  This pollution is not only in France, but across the globe, it is only a matter of time before it destroys the ecosystems on Earth, and cars are one of the biggest contributers to this destruction, coming in second only to power plants.

One Colombian city chose not to wait until such things happened, instead choosing to promote limited car usage in a more peacful manner, as described by Andrew Selsky's essay, ""

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota

"".  This city of 7 million people started a program that chooses one day a year to bann all car usage with the exception of buses and taxis, fining violators with $25. One main benefit has come out of this: People are more active phisically and therefore have less stress.  Selsky's essay can be quoted saying, ""- millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday,"". The benefits of more physical movement are obvious, but one is not so obvious: It lowers stress.  A businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". If a simple day can cause such drastic changes in the enviroment, peoples health, and lower stress, why not go ahead and do it?

In summary, while cars help us get from point A to point B quickly, and are very useful when traveling over great distance, they also cause great harm.  A simple cut back on using cars would allow the air pollution to be reduced drastically, promote physical movement and personal health, and help productivity and creativity by reducing stress. Why would you  not wish to live in a world like that?",4,4,4,4,1,3,3,3,3
"A computer software that scans your face, just to see what your feeling. The company that makes 'Facial Action Coding System' is trying to encourage schools to have these devices in their classrooms. Isn't it bad enough most of us is already trying to learn take test on computers? I don't believe classrooms should have FACS at this point of time. I do believe that our world is making new developments on this type of technology, and their idea of FACS could be improved on the near future.

One of the reasons why I believe schools should not accept this software is because it could not be safe. Yes, it is incredible to show emotions, but a camrea on your child while they work. It could be a little creepy or even stressful on them. When they work they want to feel at peace so they can work without destractions. If you put a camrea on a child they will get distracted, and feel an abondence of pressure they do not need. Your child is at school, if the teacher can not tell a student is having trouble or bored, then there is an issue.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ""Then it coul modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Dr. Huang predicts. Personally if a child is getting bored or confused, why doesn't he raise his or her hand up, and ask the teacher to explain it to him or her better, or make it more exsiting. Will some teachers get mad? Possibly, but possibly not. Teachers could take this feedback, and teach in many different ways instead of one or two certain ways, as FACS does. Teachers are all different and creative, so are the students. FACS could make it easier, but some students will still probably get confused and become bored in front of a screen all day. Students should stick with a classroom enviorment, and not a computer lab for 8 or more hours a day.

""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" says the author in paragraph 7. I think it's very impressive to use that material, but in a different enviorment. A school should be a safe place for students, teachers, and staff people. Students should know by now that if there is something wrong they need to go talk to someone. Now days so many things are happening in schools, it is completely crazy. Some students are now having a lot more chances in speaking with a person in their school district, than they did back then. Teachers and staff also should see the signs of emotions of their students. A computer software can determine these emotions, but can it help them? I don't believe so, and I'm sorry if you do not agree.

FACS is an amazing and fresh device people can use. In my opinion it can be a great material for counsilers and theripists. For schools though, I don't see it working out very well. What if a hacker sets in the computer, and can see what people are doing? New technology is scary, but maybe Dr. Huang is an amazing inventor, and has checked these terrifing details already. It's hard to trust something you are not fully for sure about. This moment is our new day and age, eventually technology will be our new world, but please leave it out of the education enviorment.",4,3,3,2,0,1,1,3,1
"Is the Electoral College really benificial? According to ""What Is the Electoral

College?"" the founding fathers established it in the the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. but, are those ""qualified citizens"" really qualified? And is

The Electoral College really helpful? Or should voters be allowed to vote directly? The

Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote.

What makes a citizen really ""qualified""? Electors are anyone not holding public office.

Also voters cannot always control who their electors are voting for. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong canidate. According to,"" Source 2: The

Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the

Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F Kennedy. Plus in other situations other electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whom they choose.

Is the Electoral College really helpful? At times it can be unfair to voters. Acording to

Source 2 : The Indefensible Electoral College"" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all , and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. In addition to that, due to the electoral college a canidate could win the popular vote but lose the presidency.

Voters should be allowed to vote directly. According to Source 2, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. If voters were allowed to vote directly then they wouldn't have to sit in wonderment of whether or not the canidate they like will be voted for by the elector. Also, voters would have more freedom of choosing who they like as a canidate for president.

Thus, the electoral college is unfair and wrong. Electors cannot always be trusted,due to them choosing who they please, also canidates can all together lose the role of presidency, and finally the majority of voters prefer a direct election. The Electoral College is out of date and should be updated. So listen to Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the

US Chamber of Commerce and abolish the Electoral College.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Driving driverless cars seems like a positve thing because it makes driving easier to do. You can navigate the car more easily with a driverless car than with a normal car. Also if you get distracted and you're about to get into a driving accident, then the car will warn you. With the driverless cars you will then save half of the fuel that we use right now.

But also driving driverless cars can be a negative thing because of people making poor choices. People think that if they use driverless cars then they really don't have to drive. But in reality it doesn't actually drive for you. It just keeps you safe from a car accident. Also since these cars are being made there are also more laws being created for the safety of others. And as a result, some states made it illegal for people to drive and even test drive driverless cars.

So driverless cars can be positive and negative for people to use. It can be positive because it would keep more people safe on the roads. Also it could help prevent accidents from happening on the roads and can help people navigate better. But these cars can also be negative for people because of poor desicions. People could take avantage of the driverless cars to thinking that they don't have to pay attention to the road. That could just cause even more accidents on the road than before. Also since these cars are now gonna be made more people are now making more laws. Since people are now making more laws, that just causes people to just ban driveless cars all together. So drverless cars can be both positve and negative for people.",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"The author is saying that the journry to Venus, despite it being very dangerous, is very worthwhile in the long run. The reasons why are a myraid and the reasons why not are the same likewise.

A great reason for why the we should travel to Venus is that Venus is our sister planet and could have had an ocean at one point. From all we know most life starts from water and if Venus once had oceans on its surface that could vary well mean that it has had some form of life on it at one point. If this were true then it would be a tremonus discovery for it would be the first life found that does not come from Earth. The evidence for this claim of oceans once touching Venus's surface is that it has mountain, vallys, craters, deep tenches that Earth similarly has when it comes to it's oceans.

Sadly however, the trip to Venus would be very exspencive and very very dangerous. Venus has a constant wave of violent storms, is constantly having volcanic eruptions, it's clouds and air are acidic and it's air pressure on it's surface is incredibly stronger than even our deepest of oceas. Not to mention that is comes into around 800 degrees normally. The evidence for this are in paragraphs 2-3 when it states that many unmaned aircrafts have been sent and none have been retuned do to them being destroyed.

Another positive is that if a sucsseful trip to Venus was made then it would mark a major shift in space exsplraion along with giving us a lot more insite into Venus's history. If Venus was to be exsplored by us than we would be given a tremondous amount of knowledge of the planet and of better space exsploration.

NASA and scinentists have been trying to find a way to get to Venus and stay on Venus. They have propossed a few awnsers: one is that they create a station that would stay above the clouds. The air pressure and acid leavels are not as bad above the clouds and the tempeture is lower as well. The only problem is that we wouldn't be able to get much knowledge from above the clouds because the clouds are so thick we wouldn't be able to see past them. Another awner to the problem is to use older tech. Stated in paragrapgh seven: ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tent to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This means that new tech is less durable however older tech, which may not be as stylish, is incredibly durable, and could be the key to finally keeping a shuttle on Venus.

As the author suggests, studying Venus would help humanity tremondously despite the dangerous it presents; even though the planet is incredibly dangerous we would still benfit in learning about our sister planet.",3,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Driverless cars are a huge advancement to our world. But the question is are they safe or not? I feel like the driverless cars are not safe for the world to use. Driverless cars can be extremely dangerous on roads because they are not smart of enough to detect non defensive drivers, drivers must be alert while in driverless cars, and lastly what if the driverless car malfunctions.

Driverless cars will not be able to recognize a non-defensive driver. The story says,"" Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"".

But what does the story say about drivers of other cars. Many drivers text and drive, blare music in the cars and not pay attention to the road, and usually most drivers aren't worried about the cars around them. This could costs people money for car wrecks but more importantly this could costs the people in driverless cars their lives.

Drivers of the driverless cars must be alert. What makes a driver alert? And is their a test to be proven if a driver is alert or not. The text states,""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over—something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"". But what happens when these built in features don't alert the driver. They could recieve the alert and not be alerted. This could lead to terrible accidents and tragedy, including being serverely injured or even death.

Some may say that driverless cars will always do there job, that's why they are tested. But what happens when the car malfunctions out of no where? The brake stop working, or the steering wheel locks up and the car can no longer turn. This is a huge factor in deciding if driverless cars should even be allowed on the road. Think about how many cars are sent back to the manufacturer because of non working parts. This could easily happen to driverless cars or any cars so are they going to be safe on the road?

Driverless cars could actually change the world as we see it, making things easier for people and lowering the amount of attention needed on the road. But before considering buying one, make sure it is safe because they cannot detect non defensive drivers, the driver of the car must be alert, and lastly the car could malfunction.",3,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Yes, i think that using this technology could be very useful for almost all grade levels in schools.

I get bored, zone out, and even just stop caring about a lesson in school, simply because i am just bored.

If this new software does what it said it can do and will do in the article then this is a huge technelogical advancment for our education and learning.

All kids learn in different ways and have different ways that they see things.

If the new software can personolize the learning of every student then schools wouldnt have problems with kids because they want to learn, grades and test scores would go up, and less trouble would be happening in a school.

If Dr. Huang and his colleagues can develop this emotion software and emotion science even more then the world could have a bright future ahead.

A lot of smarter generations are coming through.

But it would have to be mastered first because everyone has a different face and everyone reacts differently.

So i feel like it would be quite a task to get every single emotion down to see how a particular person is feeling.",1,3,1,2,0,0,1,2,1
"In the first paragraph, the first sentence kind of threw me off a little bit, because when you say it like the paragraph did then it makes it sound bad knowing other people emotions. like if I was sad or upset, and I was trying to hide it,

I wouldnt want other people knowing it.

Say I was at a family dinner and something happened, then I wouldn't want the rest of my family knowing that I am upset. Yes, some of the arguments in the article can be good like, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Thats great but honestly I dont think this would be the best thing in the world.

The article asks us ""Does your exspression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" Of course it does, just sometimes we may not know what kind of emotion it is. Sometimes you may not be able to tell it on your face but you can definitely feel it.

Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy. If you have a smile on your face, thats great, the other person thinks your happy even if you arnt. If I want someone knowing what I am feeling, I am going to tell them. I dont just want them or some computer reading my muscles in my face and telling me what emotion I am feeling.

Technology these days are getting to be way to much. Kids don't need to be told by a computer. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

What if the computer messes up the facial exspression and does something ""different"" to try to ""help"" that kid, but honestly the computer detected the wrong facial exspression and changed the lesson for the kid, when he really understood it.

This is why I dont think this is such a good idea, because sooner or later computers and technology are going to be running the world and later need updated or something and mess evereything up for our upcoming generations.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I am totally against the development of these cars.

One reason why I am against the driverless car is

because people may fall asleep while the driverless car switches over to manual driving, and you may not be aware of any of this.

Another reason why I am against the driverless car is because this car doesn't actually have a human controlling it, it's a computer. The car can accidentally hit someone then it can automatically switch to manual driving and it might cause another accident and be very dangerous.

One third reason why I am against driverless cars because this car gives many people chances to do whatever they want behind the wheel while the computer is driving.

These three examples demonstrate why I am against driverless cars. Don't be lazy when it comes to driving, so don't be a fool and buy a driverless car.",2,4,0,3,1,0,0,0,1
"In the article ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" , Luke joined , or signed up , for the Seagoing Cowboys. This job was to do hard work overseas to help with cattle and feed.

On their way, Luke went and seen different places,like China! Convincing others to participate in this important job would be hard. I think it would be hard because it is hard work. You also have to go overseas , away from your family and friends.

It would be hard to convince people to participate, or help. This is because, it is hard work, and your always busy. Here is an example from the article,""His job was to check on all the animals every hour."" That proves that he is always busy. ""But he couldn't work for a couple of days because of cracked ribs."" That is an example that he is hard working.

They have to go overseas to Greece to work as a Seagoing Cowboy. Here is an example from the text, ""They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece."" People would miss their friends and family. They would also be sore from all the hard work they have to do.

Luke was greatful from start to end. In the beginning he was greatful to participate. In the middle, he done hard work , visited and saw great experiances. In the end, he was sore but really greatful for his part. ""I'm greatful for the opportunity."" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countriesand their needs.""

First,you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you will see things you never seen before. But what if the people are scared to go on a boat? The texts states that Luke's friend Don invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat and Luke knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. The text also states that when he sighed up for Seagoing Cowboys program the animals that are on the boat kept him busy and he probely didn't know that he was on the boat.

Next, you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program because you will help people in diffrent places and save the animals too. But what if people are scared of thoses people?

The text supports Luke helped people at Europe and China. The text also supports that Luke had a night job and the animals had to be feed every hour.

Finally, you would want to go because their are fun games and nice people that will help you. But what if there aren't nice people there? In the text it states that they have cool games like table tennis, fenceing, boxing,reading, whitting, and etc. to pass time. The text also states that when it was a rainy day Luke sliped on a latter and his friends were there to safe him and help him get up from a small strip of metal.

"There are many advantages of limiting car usage. Like conserving resources when we dont drive cars. It also lowers emission and imprves safety as said in Source 4: The End of Car Culture. When you stop using cars pollution will decrease. And when the pollution decreases the earth will be healthier. Being able to drive at 16 doesnt help the advanages but between 2001 and 2009 23% of young teens stopped driving. Some advantages are its helps the enviroment, keeps people safe, and also gets pople to exercise.

The first advantage is that it helps the enviroment. Cars pollute the air a lot and if we limit the usage of cars then the air will slowly become more clean. Also the cars cause smog. With the use of cars stpping the smog will clear. As stated in Source 1: The End of Car Culture, the United States has long been one of the worlds prime cultures. But as people started to drift away from their cars, the US peaked in 2005 and is still steadily dropping. When here is cold nights and warm days the warmer layer of air traps te car emissions.

The second reason with limiting car usage is a good idea is because it keeps everyone safe. The pollution is bad for peoples health. Also a lot of people actuall get hit by cars so limting the use will cause less injuries. You wont always be looking out for the pedestrians. Also kids are the ones who get hit by cars most because you cant see the so no cars means less children getting hurt. Another good thing that will come out of limiting car usage is that we will se less gas and then we will have more natrual resources. Passener cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50% in car-intensive areas in the US as stated in Sourc 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

The final reason why limiting car usage is because it gets people to exercise. A lot of people are couch patatoes, especially in America, and dont do anything so having limitations with their car will have to make them move a little. All people like to do is use their phone or eat or watch Netflix on their free time but having no car will make them do more physical things. Having no car wll make people ride bikes from poin A to point B r even walk. Have fast food places n very corner doesnt help either because it makes peope get in their car to drive what could have been a five minute walk. When ave you ever seen a person walk to get food? Never.

Inconclusion, there are many advantages in limiting car usage like it elps the enviroment, kes people safe, and makes eople exercise. People are safe. The enviroment is slowly getting better. People are starting to exercise whether they like it or not. In some countries if yu own a car you have o pay $40,000 to have a parking space, along with what you aid for the house.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0

Then while the people of Europe were trying to recover their food supplies and animals, 44 countries joined together to form the UNRRA.

"On the matter of ""driverless cars"", I would advocate for their developement. These cars are the technology of the future. They are bringing this civilization closer and closer to a new level of technological advancement. This advancement would not only create a mammoth break through in modern day technology, but would also change the way we live our day to day lives as a worldwide culture. Despite this product being a bit more of a want than a necessity for the time being, I believe that they should continue to be improved and developed.

Driverless cars have been the seemingly unattainable, next level of fantastic futuristic technology for many people for decades now. In the 1950s, General Motors created the first car that could drive without a human at the wheel. AT that time, it would have been difficult to believe that such technology of a car that could drive itself with no type of polarized track below it would have been possible. Three decades later in the 1980s, the first speed sensors had been placed in wheels in order to provide drivers with an heightened break accuracy. Not even ten years later, those same sensors had become so advanced as to now provide drivers with the added safety of a car who could respond to the danger of out-of-control skidding. Furthermore, by the 2000s, radars that at one point had costed millions, could be found in your regular old run-of-the-mill car for your local dealer ship, ready for the purchase of any regular civillian. WIth all of this improvement in a car's safety and reliability, not only can countless lives be saved on the road with this technology, but the more it is improved upon, the less room there is for the common human error in driving, which unfortunately leads to thousands of lives being lost yearly to traffic accidents. While the current ""driverless"" cars still require some human skills when travelling through complex road conditions, with continuing developement, eventually the accuracy of the computers' driving skills will rival that of human intelligence. This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately. The only major issue that could arise is the problematic moment in which a ""driverless"" car's system would break. This would leave not only the passenger in the car in danger depending on the severity of the car failure, but it would also leave the other communters on the road in danger as well.

In conclusion, if these ""driverless"" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new ""smart"" car.",4,4,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"Driverless car's? Would there be more accidents or would it take away most of the accident's happening now. How will we know if it is safe or not? Only way to know is by building the driverless car and taking it for a test. Either way, google cofounder Sergey Brin, imagine's a time in the future where no one needs car's.

The driverless cars in my opinion are no different than any other actual car. They both really have all the same part's, but maybe not all. The driverless car has to have sensors, speed sensors, certain types of brake's, and a video camera on the rearview mirror plus more. These car's are worth so much, but could also cause tons of problem's. Not only for the driverless car, but for the other cars driving, and the people in them.

However, the passage says, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. These cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but as being said, google cars are not truly driverless. These driverless cars still need a person controlling them. Helping them in construction or near wrecks. Sergey Brin believes if these driverless cars can make it through all the trouble; making sure they are save to yourself an to others while driving they will fundamentally change the world.

With that being said, no one is really worried about how the car may be or look, but if it can follow the laws of keeping others safe. Lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Therefore, the smart cars need someone incontroll of them. Making sure if the smart car doesn't sense a pedestrian is crossing the rode, the driver can easily take controll and let the smart car proceed with it's driving. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

To end my conclusion, with all that has been said automakers will continue to search an bulid more interset into these smart cars. Until then safety is what they are aiming for and will take on that challenge of making the smart cars a better and a more saftey car for everyone. All the problems ahead of the automakers will be solved.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In the article ¨Making Mona Lisa Smile,¨ the author tells us that with technology that we have today they can see her have a full smile. The way she looks tell people that she not to comforable about something. With the special work of Computers they can change they ways she feels and look. The three reasons about how to ¨Make Mona Lisa Smile¨ is facial expressions, emotions and 3-D computers.

What so wonder well know about Mona Lisa is her face. That is, hiding how she feels by putting on a fake smile. She shows tons of facial expressions to show people how she feels. Most of it is happines by 83 percent, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Seeing the different characteristics that she has of facial muscle. While often shows vary of expressions that preforms a persons feelings. The reason Leonardo da Vinci´s painted Mona Lisa,he had studied human anatomy and convey speficc emotions.

Seeing that their are six basic emotions like happines, surprised, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Using those to associated every characteristic of the facial muscles and using them on Mona Lisa. With new software it can recongize Mona Lisa emotions. Which can actually calculate emotions of others.

An by now, knowing that we have new techonlogy like 3-D printers they can give Mona Lisa emotions.

The computer can construt a 3-D modle with all 44 muscles that must be moved like human muscles. The creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is by Dr. Paul Eckman. Which Computers can give the a certain look or emotion. The software stores similar anatomical information called electronic code. But only speacil computers can make people have emotions and faical features, not our normal PC at home.

The way people express their feelings and emotions, can show everyone how you feel about certain things. People who will try to hid their emotions are very fond of themselves for not expressing it.",0,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"My side of the story is that we shouldnt have Driverless cars. I think that we shouldnt have driverless cars because they could potentially malfunction, inflicting law, and would cause laziness.

One reason why i believe that we shouldn't have driverless cars is because they could malfunction. In the passage it states that the cars could malfunction. Thats a clear indicator that the people are not ready for driverless cars. Malfunctions could caust money or a life a human being. the aspect of cars needing money put in to them is not new but I am not going to risk my life with driverless cars.

Another reason why is that it inflicts the law. In the passage it states that the cars are only legal in 3 states and one city. they want to test them and prove that they work and so other states will legalize autonomous cars. The law is the law these cars may not even pass emission standards or other State and even Federal laws. This is another reason why we shouldnt have autonomous cars.

Another reason why we shouldnt have autonomous cars is because of laziness. technology already causes diseases to sprout and other bad cases. what will happen to people when we drive just there, eat food, get fat. We shouldnt let our country be the cause of lazy people and known as the lazy country. this is another reason why we shouldnt have autonomous cars.

I do not support the movement of autnomous cars. I dont support it because of malfunctions, inflicting on the law, and pure laziness. if we do this we will be overcome by technology a click of a button by a criminal could cause you to be killed or a malfunction of a car could kill you. This is why i dont support autonomous cars.",3,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"In the artical Making Mona Lisa Smile the author is describing how a new technology called the Factial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotiolns. No I don't think that using a computer will identify how a person is feeling and what there mood Is for the day. And I say this because what if they not really feeling that way what If they computer is guessing what thart person is really feeling. Like how would you even calculate what the percentage is and how would you even know what number to caculate. Usually how we tell If someone we know Is down Is by there face and you can tell If something happened or If they ae just tired. There is really no need for a computer to try to tell If someone is sad , happy, or mad It's all about your face expression and the way they walk and carry themselfes. When you look back at the text you can see that a classroom computer could recongize when a student is being confused or bored. You really can't though yes it's possible but for now you can't really try to relate to the passage and having computers read your mood and thoughts and feelings.

"Now you can actually know how thye feel by an app. This is now something that is being used to recognise the emotions of old paintings and it might actually be good for people. it will be able to tell how you really feel, it can hlp kids in school. and it also helps produce emotions.

We all know someone that says they are fine but they think something else, but we cant fingure out how they also feel. But with this new program it will be way easier and that is a good thing. ""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)."" Since this software can tell peoples emotions it could help in therapy with things, like if a person comes in for therapy but says they feel good about it but they dont act like it the therapist could do this test and see what they are having trouble with or how they really feel about the subject at hand.

Some kids can get bored in school and just zone out because the material they are being taught does not click with them but that can be changed with this new program. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Dr. huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" this could benifit both the school system and the child. the child will be more attentive with the lesson if he or she understands it or they think it is interesting and then they might even score higher in school, and have a better futre.

Some people might just look mean when you walk by them, or it may even be you that always gets asked ""You always look mad so i dont talk to you."" nut now since this program came out, the theory that comes with it is that it can help you produce new emotions. "" According to the Facial feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them."" this can benifit poeple in many ways. They might become happier and more out going. They could have better oppertunities when it comes to work because they have a good attutide.

"The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution was established by the founding fathers. The question is, Is it time for it to go?  I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, because changing the election by popular vote would not be wiser, and the Electoral College is fair for the people.

Changing the election by popular vote would not be smarter. Source 3 states, ""In 2012's election... Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the  electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" This source is arguing against the Electoral college, meaning they're trying to make a point on why it's not fair that Obama won with his 61.7 percent. The people vote for their electoral college, for their state. If the electoral college's votes are higher than the popular votes that means that the college is doing their job correctly. Source 3 also states, ""... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral- vote victory in that state."" This statement means that even if the popular and electoral votes are both high, the electoral vote wins, because majority rules. Just because the person running for office is popular, doesnt mean they should necessarily win. Electoral votes basically come from the people, and if the ""people"" choose a certain candidate, then that's who should win.

The Electoral College is fair to everyone. Source 2 states, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This method of choosing the president is completely and totally fair to the people. No, they're not directly choosing who the president is, but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral college board should be filled with all the right people. Yes there is a possibility that the candidate someone votes for may not make it on the Electoral college board, but if the majority of the people are represnted, then that's all that matters. Source 3 states, ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person.

Eventhough some people think that the electoral college, should be no more, I strongly disagree, because the college is fair to the people -because they represent the people- and the college is a smart idea. The college works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the elctoral college will not win presidency.

In conclusion, the Electoral college is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral college is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people  always get a fair say in government matters.",4,4,1,2,1,2,1,1,1
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.

Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.

For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.

Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth. This does not mean that there is no life on Mars, it just means that the Face is not a hint to finding it.",3,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"First of all, good morning/afternoon/night, hope you're having a good day.

So, the author gives many details to prove that visiting Venus is worth the dangers and who knows what else can be there, explaining that this planet could be our safest/secure option to explore, since has many characteristics from the Earth, like he says, mountains, valleys, and craters, and also that Venus was more likely to be the planet where there was life just like in the Earth actually, and that's exactly why so many scientists and astronomers are fascinated by our sister planet, even if it is almost or basically inhospitable.

He honestly has a point, if Venus has all of those good things, then why not can we do an effort and visit it?

Technology has advanced a LOT, and we have people intelligent enough, so it is possible to visit Venus, and when that happens, we could examinate and analyze this planet, so we can find a way to make it a future home for us, since the Earth is actually in a really bad state, thanks to us, humans that don't notice how bad this situation is.

The author even includes the NASA, thing that with other important things that he says (like information about what NASA is doing, and other important data about what can we do) means that he's very serious about this, so, here, he makes a really clear and explained claim, where he provides specific details and information that we definitely need to considerate, in conclusion.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The electotral college doesnt work in my opinion. It has too many flaws such as you are voting for a state. Thanks to the electoral college the 2000 election was a disaster. The electoral college system is unfair in a way because if your from some where with a lot of points your going to win that state. And if you win lots of small states it doesnt matter because someone can win two big states and beat you. Obviously candidates arent going to spend a lot of time in a state they know they have no shot of winning.

In 2000 17 states didnt get to see any candidates, because the candidates didnt consider them big states.

On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors in the first place? It dopends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the states partys central comitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.

"Everybody in the world has emotions and displays them in different ways. One common way people display emotions are through their facial expressions. However, it is not always easy for people to read others' emotions. In the article, Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks about a new computer software called the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) that was used to read the famous Mona Lisa's emotions. In the article, the author mentions this software being used in a classroom setting to read students' emotions to tell if they are confused or bored to modify the lesson like an actual teacher. The use of this software in a classroom would be extremely beneficial for students who struggle staying focused or are not interested in learning at all.

A student sits in class doing a computer lesson. However, this student is unable to sit still in their seat for a fraction of a second because of how bored they have become with the lesson. If the FACS was in use, the student would have a much easier time being engaged in their learning. If classes were to use facial recognition software for lessons, when students become frustrated or confused, the lesson will be able to adjust to the students' needs instead of having the students become frustrated with their teachers. Dr. Huang predicts if this kind of software was used in a class, the lessons would be able to modify ""like an effective human instructor."" The FACS would be extremely beneficial to students and teachers alike! However, some people would not agree with the claim that facial recognition software should be used in a classroom.

Someone might believe that the use of the FACS would not be helpful for students in a classroom setting. They may believe that the software is an unnecessary use of resources because they might not believe the software is effective because it may be unable to detect emotions in an effective way. In the article, it states that the Mona Lisa was ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" They may believe that if the software detects mixed emotions, it would not be useful.

However, this claim is wrong in every sense of the word. The computer software is accurate enough to tell a real smile from a fake smile through the muscles that are being moved in the face. The software uses a 3-D computer model of the face and compare the expression of a user's face to a neutral face. ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles,"" so there is no way it cannot be accurate!

The use of the Facial Action Coding System for computer lessons would be an extremely beneficial addition to the classroom setting. It would make teaching and learning a lot more easier for teachers and students alike. School administrations should take serious consideration when deciding whether or not to integrate this software into teaching.",3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3

"Dear state senator,

I think that Electoral College is a great and fast way to gather up votes to pick on our new president but i think that it has some big issues and the neagtives overcome the positives. One of the great things Electoral College brings that it is widely regarded as anarchronism with means that the votes wont be ""overruled"" it would acutally be the maguraty of the people voting on the president. If not it would be the elctors who elect the president, not the people. Also the party the people select is highly trusted and rarely betrayed. There have been a lot of cases in the past that go against Electoral College. One of the things that i am against the electoral college is that the voters dont actually vote on the presidental runner up they are actually voting on the state electors that who in turn elect the president. Also most worrying is in the case of a tie in the electrical vote. In that special case the elctection would actually have to go to the House of Representatives which means that state delegations vote on the president and The Senate would choose the vice-president. Basically the Electoral College is unfair to voters cause of the winner takes it all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning so they only focus on the tight ""swing"" states. Its official in my opinion that the Electoral College  is unfair , outdated , lack of democratic pedigree and irrational. It has lack of reasons in favor. I think we should just get over with this and go old school and get done with all this confusing matter and change to election to popular votes it took more of time but it was more accurate and caused less problems. Amazingly Bob Dole was right: Abolish the Electoral College!",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In the article ""Driverless cars are coming"". I thought that its a great idea to make driverless cars. The reasons are pubic transportation systems, could improve roads, and makes it safer for drivers. Thats why I think they they should develope self driving cars.

Transportatation for people is really critacl because they need to get places fast and in a safe way. The cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and flexibilty than a bus said the aricle on the fisrt paragh. Which leads to the point in where

safer transportsion means there should be safer roads.

Safer roads is one of the biggest things the world should have. In the 3rd pragrah its says, ""the track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciver on the front end of the car."" What this is saying is that if the roads would be contraled by people , but the people would be contraling the cars so they can navagate in where the care would be going. Then if we navagate the car it means we can make the driver safe.

Keeping the driver safe is a really good thing to do. To do this is by having alot of sensors in the car and also out side of the car. In paragrah number 7 in the articel it says, "" they can steer, acclerate, and brake themselves, but all are disinged to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skilles, such as navigating through work zones. What this means is that humans driver have to be alerted to take over. This is a good thing becasue we could add another sensor which can navagate threw work zones so that the drive does not have to crash.

Finally, I think that drivless cars should be around the world so that people would get to places faster and be much safer and not crush and get sude by other people. Also, I hope that other states in america are able to pass the law for self driving cars to take place.",3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Car emissions are very deadly and dangerous. They can be lethal to humans, and also dangerous to the enviroment. It can lead to big enviromental issues like global warming, holes in the ozone, and air pollution. Many ignore the fact or are oblivious to it, but driving hurts our enviroment just for a little bit of convienence. Are cars doing more harm than good?

Cars have a convienent way of getting us to our destination faster but at the cost of our precious enviroment. We use our cars sometimes without thinking twice of what the actual after effect is. Paris is a city that has had almost, if not the worst, smog levels in all of europe. It has 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter due to the majority of cars which have diesel powered engines. Air pollution doen't jsut effect our atmosphere, it slowly kills, if not severly injuers, animals and people. It hurts us by causing major damage to our lungs and respitory system.

Greenhouse gases are another major thing in car emissions. Greenhouse gases are gases that keep or trap heat on earth to keep us from going into another ice age. A decent amount is good and is used to do its job, but when you have too much then the globe starts to increase in temperature. Antarctica, as you know, is made of ice. when ice gets to a certain temperature it starts to turn into a liquid. So when antarctica starts to melt into the sea, the general ocean level will rise, causing sea level cities, states, and countries start to flood with salty ocean water. If we cut down on gas or diesel car travels, the and greenhouse production rate would slow down and so will the rising temperature of the earth decreasing the speed of the melting arctic.

Cars are a very important and convienent way of travel but can be very deadly to us humans and tne earth we live on. Because we use them everyday doesn't mean that we can not cut down or change our ways of transpertation. Cars give off many harmful toxins and gases that we can, but refuse to control. we can cut down on the majority of the waste by limiting our car trips distance wise and based on how many times you leave the driveway. a simple change as in riding a bike or walking or even only going out when needed can slow down the speed of global warming and even drop the levels of air pollution. A little change can maybe just save the earth from another flood that can wipe out humainity.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Imagine life with little to no cars, think of all the sites that you will see because now you walk everywhere you go. Think of all the people you will meet along every corner, when you go to the mall, the grocery store, and on your way to a friend's house. You will notice and appreaciate things you haven't before, this idea is all thanks to a suburban town in VAUBAN, Germany. Now, we will be able to enjoy the sites of our surroundings and the people in it, produce less gas emissions, and a better outlook on the future.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter, a resient of VAUBAN, Germany. Getting rid of our cars may sound like a scary thought but in reality it can bring great things to us. When we stop bundling ourselves up in our automoblies we get to explore the world better, we get to touch and smell the things around us and appreaciate them. We advance our knowledge on the things and people around us because of walking to our daily commute or day off. We also meet new people, around every corner will be a new face, maybe they or you will ask for help and from there spark a friendship. You'll find a sea of people that have the same interest as you or don't but because we no longer rely on cars we are introduced to the world more and are truly exposed to the people and things in it, giving us a better understanding of where we live and all that it has to give to us.

Global warming, we hear about it a lot especially today where green house emissions are high, however, when we reduce the usage of cars the world, along with us benefit.

In Paris, after days of near- record pollution a partial driving ban was in order to ""clear the air of the global city."" ""Four thousand driver were fined and twenty- seven people had their cars impounded for the reaction to the fine."", by Monday the smog had cleared enough and the French party rescinded the band for odd numbered plates on Tuesday. Meanwhile in BOTOGA, Colombia, it has been the third straight year that cars have been banned in the hope to promote alternative transportation and smog. This event has been so successful that ""for the first time two other Colombian cities,Cali and Valledupar, joined the event."" We all dream to live a long, happy life but in order to do so we need to treat our Earth right. When we reduce our usage of cars we can fulfill this dream.

""Parks and sport centers also have bloomed throught the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" Imagine living in a new nice community, better economy, and better health. With all the walking and biking everywhere we are faced with physical workouts, benefitting considering that America is considered the most obese nation. And with all the walking and biking, stores are made closer to walking distance instead of on a distant highway, bring in more consumers. Without cars there is less deaths due to them aswell. In result, we have a better look into the future then we might have if we didn't decide to get rid of cars.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars would benefit the world and the people in it entirely. We would we more aware of our surroundings and citizens, reduce global warming, and have a better future to look upon.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The face on Mars is just a natural formation. It wasn't built by any aliens. Natural formations like the face are commonly seen in that area of Mars. The formation does not completely resemble a face; there are many flaws. NASA would tell the public if they had any solid evidence that suggests it was built by aliens.

Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face.

The rock formation doesn't resemble a face perfectly. There are flaws that suggests it is just a natural formation. If it was an alien built formation, there would be a lot less flaws. They wouldn't waste all that time making it and leave so many flaws.

"The smile of the Mona Lisa has

eluded people for centuries. The slightly smug look suggests an

emotion that not many people can detect. Luckily, there appears to be a software that can detect one's emotion based off of the facial movements one makes.The software was developed by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute, and there could be so many uses that this technology could be applied to. One such example is the classroom, where teachers will know when a student is becoming confused or bored. However, one must ask the questions that this technology brings. In essence, this software is not useful, applicable or effective inside of the classroom because of the cost of the software, the intrusion of privacy, and a host of other problems. Computing technology could have the ability to be useful inside of the classrom, just not this kind.

The first point that would make teachers unsure is the cost of the software. In the article, there is no mention of the cost of the newly developed software. There are numbers, indeed, but they are simply percentages or single numbers. Based on what the article said, one could assume that the cost of this technology would be high. This would not be a very effective tool for an average American school, but the tech could be applied to richer schools or universities.

Secondly, the software is an intrusion of privacy in the school. Although most public schools are indeed public places where civilians expose themselves, it also has a private element to it. Think of it as a small shard of individuality and alone time, like when one is at lunch. The software, if mounted on a camera or a tripod, would be able to observe every single student and every emotion in the room. Schools do need safety, indeed , but the use of this technology in an academic situation just seems proposterous. An alternative use would be to use this technology in hospitals, where nurses could percieve the emotion of patients, and whether they are in pain or not.

Although the technology developed by Dr. Huang and his colleagues is certainly impressive, the use of it in a school enviroment seems odd and misinformed. Schools are still meant to be relatively private places where people can feel safe and secure. The costs of this technology is unknown, but it is likely that it is not cheap. Artificial intelligence is meant to be used as efficiently as possible, and although scientists do have free reign on what they use this software for, applying it in schools is not the best way to make use of it.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2

"The electoral college must go down! The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population. The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system. Using popular vote is more precise and accurate than the electoral college. Popular vote is voted by citizens in which many people not including me should change the electoral system for the popular vote system. Therefore, the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country.

Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed  up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area.

Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population. Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting.

Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system. For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person. Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible.

Using popular vote would be a great and ideal way to decide who is the president during the nationwide election. It should be important to many people as we the people of the United States decide who will take over the countries' responsibility and economy. Yes, the popular votes is a great and ideal way to vote but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. However, they can fix this problem by eliminating the electoral votes process. Therefore, it makes it clear that having a popular vote to deide who is the winner would be better when it is election time.

Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. Abolish the electoral system college once and for all!",5,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Facial Action Coding at schools?

Class rooms with , Facial Action Coding , ? I think for a classroom with Facial Action Coding would not be such a good idea in a classroom. There are many reasons why it's not a good idea. There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that "" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.

For many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.

Other places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. At a hostpital a patient could be help out with the machine and tell if she or he is sad or happy. At a nursing home he can help out the the old folks by making sure that there not depressed or angry.

What if the Facial Action Cding system shows that 50% percent of the student show that they really get the work. And the other 50% percent do not get the work what would the teacher do? Would the teacher choice be right to choose to get the same work where the 50% percent doesn't understand it and give the same work to the other 50% percent of the class that already knows how to solve the work. I think it not a good idea for classrooms to have Facial Action Coding System at schools.

At schools it might not be a good idea and might be better in many other places. For many students it coulld distract them or if other dont want to show emotions because of there personal thoughts being shown to teachers. Would you want schools to have this new Facial Action Coding System at there school and on computers?",3,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Well using facial recognition to read the emotional expressions of the students in class seems pointless to use. In what ways would it help to know how a teachers students are feeling? Students are at school to learn what they need to learn, not neccesarily what they want to know. It is not their choice what they learn, so if they get bored or not, it does not mean you could just modify the lesson, but instead they would have to finish the lesson one way or another. Facial recognition of students expressions in the class room, would not help their education in any ways.

Having this technology in the classroom not only may it tell the emotions of the children, but it invades their personal privacy as well. The way students feel while in class has a much greater horizen than just inside the classroom, but as well as everything going on in their lives, such as parents, friends, things at home, work, etc. Which is an invasion of personal privacy to the way someone feels, that may have nothing to with school. It is said in the article “A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” But what about all the other emotions other than just confusion and bordem? All the other that are included such as ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"", but the problem with this is that these aren't all the emotions but merely just six specfic ones. So how could you determine how someone is feeling emotionally without all the other emotions that all concide with each other? You can't, because it's impossible to tell how someone is feeling emotionally.

It all comes back to the Facial Action Coding System, can it accurately determine someones emotional state only through facial expressions? As stated ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don’t lie;"", The system may be able to tell if the subject is faking a facial expression, but what help would that be in the classroom. Even if someone is faking an emotion, you still truely couldn't tell how they feel mentally especially through FACS. As D'Alto says ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions—happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" this means the system only has 6 BASIC emotions, it still couldn't be able comprehend the greater complexity of feelings and how they all work together to truely tell how a person is feeling.

The FACS could be very helpful in many other fields, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive—for video games or video surgery."" It could change everything, the way plastic surgery is performed, create simulations, help mental health, it could be used in court to find if someone is guilty, military, and medicine as well. The application could have millions of good uses around the world as well as endless possiblities for the future, just not for education.

In conclusion I believe using the Facial Action Coding System would not only be wrong, but inaccurate, an invasion of privacy, and would have no good practical use in a classroom. Although it could have many applications in other fields it just wouldn't work out in a setting of a school or college, reading the emotional expressions of students. There are other ways to be able to engage students in work and to help them when they are struggling. Teachers need to be able to help their students, having software that can tell a students emotions won't help anything or anyone until the teacher steps in and does something. But having a computer to read students facial experssions to be able to know their emotions would only add onto the problem.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"In this article, the author presents us with facts about what makes Venus dangerous, and why we should try to study it despite the danger that comes with it. He provides many examples of the harsh conditions of Venus, but is lacking when it comes to reasons why we should continue to study it. Safety is the number one priority in all scientific research, and I don't think this author provides enough reasons why studying Venus is worth the risk. Furthermore, when he does provide his reasons they are quickly proved wrong by himself in later paragraphs, which lowers his point immensly.

The author writes a lot about the challenges of going to Venus, and what makes Venus so dangerous. Yet, he barely provides any information on why it is important to go there. In paragraph 3 he writes, ""...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustumed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" He also writes about the extreme temperatures, 97% CO2 atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and things like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All of these challenges and dangers in one paragraph, and not even one reason why we should face these challenges and go there. In the next paragraph he says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" He also go on to provide more information about how similar Venus is to our own planet, but still, no good reasons why we should spend money researching this planet. When you are talking about visiting a planet as dangerous as Venus, you need a lot of good reasons to go there. However, this author is lacking in his reasons, which makes him sound unprofessional.

Without providing a lot of research, it is hard to agree with what the author is saying. He does not do a great job of proving his point that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 5 he writes, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusion landscape."" At first, this seems like a viable solution to the dangers of Venus, and sounds like a good way to safely research the planet more closely. However, it's quickly shot down and is identified as a less than desireable solution in the next paragraph by the author himself. He states facts about how we wouldn't be able to capture photographs from this distance through Venus's thick atmosphere. He also points out that we would not be able to retreive samples of rock, gas, or anything else from this distance. This is the only good possible solution to the dangers of Venus that the author has presented thus far, and he debunks the idea almost entirely in the very next paragraph. This is a terrible way to convince the readers of his opinion; that, despite the risks Venus presents, it is a worthy pursuit to study it.

In conclusion, the author presents more ideas that go against his point, than ideas that acually support it. He does a terrible job of supporting his ideas, and when he has a good point, he quickly proves to us himself that it is not a good idea at all. Taking all of these things into account, we can conclude that the author does a very poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",5,4,4,4,2,2,3,4,3
"Dear state senator,

I ask you  to change the voting methods to popular vote instaed of Electoral collage because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes; focus more on those that have many Electoral collage votes and candidates for presidency dont need to be the most popular of all to win the presidency.

Candidates don't really care for small states with small population because they know that they don't matter in the resultof them being elected as president or not. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Seventeen states didn't see the candidates al all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get so see a single campain as. ""You may ask yourself why they didn't see any of of this well one thing that both of them share is that they dont have as many electoral collage votes as other states like Califoprnia that has 55 electoral votes. And it's a winner take all the less popular candidate from the state doesn't get any votes at all.

You dont have to be the most popular in the nation in order to win the precidency and its a winner take all. According to the ""The Indefensible Electoral Collage: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford  Plumer ""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slater of elctors, who in turn elect the president."" For example when bush was running for precident he was not the most popular in the natuion and Gore was, in the end Bush was elected president for winning more the electoral votes then Gore. This is unfair for many people because more then half the nation didn't want Bush but yet he was elected without the popular vote.

However According to ""In Defense of the Electoral Collage: Five reasons to keep our despised methods of choosing the

President""  by Richard A. Posner there is less likely to be a dispute over the electoral collage votes then in a dispute over the popular vote. It also requires a a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. ""The electoral collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

This is why I ask you state senator to change from Electoral Collage voting methed to The Popular voting to elect The President Of The United states Of America  because the candidates for presidency give no importance to small states that do not have many electoral collage votes and care more for those that do plus the candidate doesn't have to be the most popular in the to win the elections to become the President of the U.S.A.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,0
"Dear Senator,

I think that you should help change the way we vote. In my opinion, its complete nonsense that this ""Electoral College"" process is used. If there are citizens who want a good president, and the Congress wants different, it's pretty obvious that the citizens are going to be beyond disappointed that someone different was chosen.

First off, I suggest that some states stop using the ""winner-takes-all"" system. I think that process is outrageous. Do you really think this process is choosing the right person to run our country? Just because the Congress likes this system, doesn't mean we, the people of the United States, preferably enjoy it.

Next, I believe that we should be able to choose our electors, because some people in the government make mistakes. Sometimes people are wrong about other people. Each state only casts one vote, so we better make the best out of it, right?

Also, there is a few reasons why this process is good. One reason why is because if there wasn't this secure system, it would probably be total chaos. Another reason is that this system helps choose which president will do the better for the United States.

Overall I think that this a bad process, and I think they should change this.",2,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,1
"The author suggestion to still try to visit Venus knowing how dangerous it is very risky. Although Venus has a lot of similarties when it comes to Earth, there are even more differences that play a big part in the visit.

The author's theory on trying to visit Venus it will be very hard and with take time. It would take a lot of time because of the harsh weather conditions and the high atmospheric pressure. In the third paragraph, the author states that "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experience on out own planet."" which provides the exact numbers for what it would feel like compared to Earth and is very dangerous becuause of the extreme temperature and the crushing atomphic pressure.

The author provides more information that it can be very dangerous by stating that even 30 miles above the surface it would be very hot, around 170 degrees but the pressure would be lower. A benefit of visiting Venus is that we maybe able to know if there were anymore human like species or maybe even aliens because of the large amountof comprasions and history believed to be on Venus. One of the last problems is that it would be very hardto get any type of samples because if they got too close to the surface then they would melt to death so what would be the poin tof visiting a place that you may not be able to do actual studies on and may not be able to get more then a picture or video of the surface from 30 miles above the planet unless you take time to heavly prepare and create something to with stand the conditions.

Those are the reasons why it is very hard for NASA to visit venus and why it may benfit our history and future generations to come if we can make the visit even though it is very risky right now.",1,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"In my personal opinion I would say that the technology to read other people emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not a good valuable. The Facial Action Coding System wouldn't be a good valuable because why would school bother buying the Facial Action Coding Sysytem for their student just to check if they happy or not. Instead of buying Facial Action coding System they should buy school material,books or even online websites for kids to learn,because kids really wouldn't like a computer checking them out if they are happy or sad.

Students wouldnt like to go to school knowing that almost everyday that there going to check their emotions. Everyday there are people that go to school sad,depressed,happy, and exited and those people dont wat to tell other people how they feel like. Even if those people try to fake smile theey wouldn't get away without it because in the article it say's ""In a false smile,the mouth is streched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. To an expert,faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. So this means that it can detect a fake smile because of our face muscle called orbicularis pars palpabraeus.

Even though it's kinda a cool invention but it shouldn't be for students or schools because sometime students want to fix here emotion by themselve or sometimes they don't want anyone to see that person emotion. My own opinion the Facial Acting Coding System should be used in places like in therapy or somewhere just related to behavior but it wouldn't be a good value in a school.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0

"Radiaton, heat and atmospheric pressures are some of the biggest reason that we have not gotten to explore that much of the planet we know as venus.

The second planet from the sun is said to be the closest relative to the one we live on today. For years humans have thought of Venus as inhabitable, but the author of this article thinks otherwise.

The author claims that Venus is the closest in size and density, in comparison to Earth. He then talks about how Earth, Mars and Venus are all planetary neighbors. Since Venus is one of the closest to us, He claims that it is one of the easier planets to explore. ""humans have sent numerous spacecrafters to land on this cloud- draped world"" Though we have sent spacecraftsno one has survived for more than a few hours.

As of now Venus is very dangous. With atmospheric pressures exceding earth with 90 times more pressure than us, and temperatures of over 800 degrees, these conditons arent exactly what humans how live on earth, where the max temperature has maybe been 140. But he ask, if the condtions are so bad, why are scientist trying so hard to explore the planet. He goes into how Venus use to have a presense just like earth. ""largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, like earth.

I think what the author is trying to get at is, Maybe one day we can send humans to venus and maybe they are start living there. We are already planning on sending humans to Mars in the near future, it shouldnt be long until NASA looks into sending humans to other planets. And the other closest one, as well as it being similiar to earth, is venus.

Even with the dangerous atmosphere of Venus, it still facinates humans to this day. With the overpopulation of Earth, it is time we look into sending people to other planets. And with venus being one of the most similar planets in comparison to Earth, it might not be long until we look into sending humans to the planet.",1,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"There are many people that are for having driverless cars, but I am against it. I am against it for many reason. First reason is because it will make people lazy. Second reason is because a computer cannot think like a human brain. Last reason is because they are not safe.

My first reason I am against these cars are because they will make people lazy. America already has enough lazy people. So why will we waste money on sensors to make a car drive by itself when we can control it ourselfs. According to paragragh 7

""They can steer, accelerate, and brake by themselfs."" But paragraph 7 also say

""road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" Which proves the only time you will actually have to drive is if you run into those situations.

Another reason I am against driverless cars ae because we can't trust technolgy to get us out of every situations. For example say you are riding and you car comes out to oncoming traffic and it wont stop. There will be nothing yuo can do to stop it. But if you can actually control the car than you wont have to worry about that because you know when to stop our car. Technology wise we are not ready for a driverless vechical.

My final reason I am against these cars are because the just arent safe. There are so many things that can happen while driving this car. For example a glitch can happen in the systemor you cars brakes stop working and you wont be able to stop and you could have nothing to do about it. In paragragh 6 it say a radar cost ""two hundred million dollars."" Why can't we use that money to make cars we can frive by ourselfs safer other than wasting money on a computer that can glitch out and stop working on us?

I am against driverless cars because they will make us lazier as a nation. They cannot think like a human brain. And finally because they just are not safe enough to be on the roads.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"electoral college is a process not a place. the Electoral college work on the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice president couting each voter by congress. large populations in states lose by virtue in the mal-apportionment in Senate decreed in the Constitution. popular votes were mostly in florida but in the year 2012 when obama was just beginning to be president, he got 29 eectoral votes it was a success in the same margin in wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes. other things being the same alot of large states get more attention from the presidential candidates in a campaign than some small states do. the electoral college is supossed to be a procces for the electors to vote for president and vice president and every 4 years theres gonna be someone new thats facing the president to be voted for the new president of the united states but when the electors come and vote if the president will still stay the president then he,ll become it for another 4 years but if the guy facing his way to be our new president mr. obama will have to stay as vice president. in columbia the district is allocated 3 electors and something like a state for purposes because of the electoral college. the reason in the following discussion the word ""state"" is also refered as the district of columbia. each person who is running for president your state has his or her own group of electors they are generally chosen to the candidates political party but the state laws vary on how there electors get selected on what there",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No I think that the Electoral College does not work, and it has no meaning. One reason is each running canidate for president has its own has his or her own group of electors. The electors are usually picked by the canidate's political party. Which is good that they have there own because then the votes would just be a landslide on the outcome of it. Then the citizens votes come in and thats when the votes start to seperate in total, because theres more citizens voting for the other runner than there are electors of those running presidents and vice presidents. Now every state has there own amount of electoral votes.

Now there are some bad things about the electoral colleges, for instance under this system you vote for the electors, who in turn vote for the president. And for instance you lived in Texas and wanted to vote for someone, you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors that pledged to that person, then he would get all those electoral votes for the state of Texas. And voters can't always control who there electors vote for but they can sometimes, if they know who there electors are voting for. And they also sometimes get confused about the electors and sometimes vote for the wrong canidate.

So pretty much at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Canidates dont spend time in states thet know they dont have no chance of winning. And it doesnt really give them a chance to vote for who they want to vote for the electors do that part.

The most worried outcome of the votes is a tie in the electoral vote part. If that happens the election would be decided by the House Of Representatives, where they will vote on the president. And the senate would choose the vice-president. Because each state gives out only one vote. But the House's selection will most likely not reflect on the peoples choice.

Well thats what i think of the electoral college, its unfair, and outdated. I think we should get rid of this system because its reallly bad towards voters, and it  would make voting have more freedom other than leaving your voting up to the electors,  instead of yourself. And the winner-take-all system is dumb also because you have really no control over who wins if that system is available.",2,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Growing up as a kid having a teacher to teach isn't anymore normal than having a pencil to write with. Thinking about my children having a computer instead of a teacher seems less traditional and in my opinion less affective. With humans teaching humans, we are able to tell when something isn't right because we can relate to each others feelings and their standings on the topic. With a computer that isn't really an option.

For example, Nick D'Alto mentioned how the computer could calculate the Mona Lisa and show what percentage of feelings she is having. Another example given is when D'Alto mentions how it can be used to show whenever politicians and/or performers are not being truthful when they are speaking to the audience. Nick says that ""Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code."" Nick is mentioning how the computer is able to read art and painted faces and if it continues, maybe our faces.

Considering that a computer showing us when somebody is feeling an emotion other than happiness may be good, I think we should be more focused on doing it ourselves and not using a machine for easy to use capabilities. Since the computer scans the faces muscles which isn't something people are really looking after when having a conversation on somebody's opinion.

However, the computer provides great possibilities in the modern to future world. For example, when we made the lie detector test for obviously showing if someone is lying while answering a series of questions was a huge breakthrough. This computer could bring an even bigger outcome since it is reading mouth eye and other face muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" Dr. Huang is trying to give the point that each emotion can be seen at a different way just slightly everytime. Who knows where this computer process could lead us to or what we can do with it.

None the less, in the classroom a teacher can teach best because that teacher knows not every student is the same. You can ask any parent of 2 or more children and they will confirm that claim. On the political and celebrity standpoint, this could reel out some unknown hintings toward how they really feel. In the end, we have a long way to come as a species and we have a long road also behind us.",3,2,3,2,1,1,2,1,1
"It's been a large debate on if the Face in Mars is a natural landform. I believe the Face in Mars is a natural landform from natural disasters happening on Mars. One thing that leads me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform is when it says in paragraph 7 ""Thosands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

So, proof was also given that the mysterious Face on Mars was a natural landform. In paragraph 11 it states that objects were found in the picture such as airplains, Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks. This leads me to believe that all the objects are also causes of this natural landform on Mars because objects like these may leave marks, or spots and ect. Lastly, what led me to believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landfrom is paragrapgh 12 saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This says that the Face is way to large to be a human face or alien. in conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because there was proof that it is, objects were found on the picture making spots, marks and ect., and that the face is way to big to be a human's face or alien's.",1,3,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
"What do you think about diverless car? There are advantages and disadvantages to diverless cars. In the article ""Diverless Cars Are Coming,"" the Google cofounder, ""Sergey Brin"" envisions a future public tranportation system where fleets of diverless cars form a public taxi system.

Now a days everyone is on their phones or laptops doing business work or simiply being on soical media, the last thing we need are cars without divers.

"Dear state senator,

I dont think it is very fair that you tell people there vote counts but what a lot of people dont know is that it doesn't. Instead it consists of 538 electoral voters who use the majority rule to elect the president. There are millions of voters who are just wasting there time on election day voting on who they think should be president. Did you know over 60 percent of voters prefer a direct election over a electoral college. 60 percent!

That's majority rule right there and you still havn't done anything about it. When people vote they are voting for the president not for a slate of electors. Not only is that false advertising but it's wrong. Vote for president Obama the signs say but do they really mean it? I guess not.

Just think if you were a voter and you thought it counted. i think you should change from the electoral college to the popular vote. Look what the electoral college has made for presidents over the past century. George Bush went to war with irag and Afghanistan making us far into dept. Then they voted for Obama who is taking over 20 TRILLION DOLLARS from China, and how does he expect to pay them back?

Very simple, he is just gonna brush it off like nothing is happening and wait for re-election and pass the dept off to the new president. So, if popular vote was now going on i think the public would be better at deciding whether or not one person deserves to be president more then the other. Ill let you decide.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,1
"There have been a few close calls during our presidential ellection over the past decades, but it doesn't mean it's enough to scratch it out and throw it away. We should keep the Electoral College for many reasons, but mostly to keep chaos from happening.

To begin with, the Electoral College has been the method we have used for years for choosing our next President, so why would we change it now? Well, the answer is we shouldn't. It may seem like a good idea at first to change to the election by popular vote, but here's the problem. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, but less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The Electoral College is what helps the candidates from winning from a landslide. The Electoral consists of 583 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is reqquired to elect the President. So even though some may say you're not choosing your President, you're actually helping to chose your President. When you vote you're actually voting for an elector that will (most likely) vote for the candidate to your appeal.

Furthermore, many people such as Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and even the Chamber of Commerce have agreed to abolish the Electoral College. According to a Gallup poll in 2000, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Although, this all may seem like a time for change, isn't the Electoral College doing us a favor? ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" The Electoral College is a process, as a compromise established by our founding fathers, between election of the President by a vote in cCongress  and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

Last, but not least, the Electoral College helps with voting for President. ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed."" It is possible for the winner to win the electoral vote, but will not win the national popular vote. ""The Electoral College requires a candidate to have transregional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" ""So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, that he knows he will will."" Therefor, he will not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurality in those states in favor of him. ""This is a desirable result because the candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.

All in all, we should keep the Electoral College because it helps balance out the nation's amount of votes for a good successful President that will help it's people.",3,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The electoral college has come too far. It is old, a disaster factor, unfair, and very irrational. Many of the arguments made to support the Electoral College are based on mostly assertions and not much on reality. (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, paragraphs 9,10,11, and14.)

Under the electoral college system, us voters do not actually vote for the president. We vote for a slate of electors who then vote for the president. Although we do have a say in who votes for our president, most people prefer a more direct approach. In some cases, one being Al Gore's, the candidate can win the popularity vote, but only to lose it all in the electral college vote. If the candidate wins the majority vote, that clearly means many people want them in office. Which brings me back to the original point. Why have the electoral college vote for someone else when the masses are making it very clear who they prefer in office.

One of the best, consistent arguments made against the electoral college is something we might call the disaster factor. The 2000 election fiasco could have been much worst considering the type of system we have. The state legislatures are the ones responsible for picking electors, who can ,at any moment, go against the will of the people. Electors have even refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they deem acceptable.

One of the riskiest situations that come with the electoral college are ties. When there is a tie, the case is taken over to the House of Representatives, where the each state delegation will vote for the president. Each state casts only one vote, which means one representative from Wyoming is representing 500,000 voter. This would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. One person can choose the destiny of all those voters who don't get much of a say. Electoral ties are not as unlikely as they seem. In 1976, for example. a tie would have occurred if only 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted for the opposite party.

When you boil it down, the electoral college is downright unfair to voters. It is unfair, outdated, and in needs of improvement. We live in a country where everyone should have a voice, not just one person representing the voices of everyone. This is why we should rid of the electoral college. Voters know what they want and shouldn't have to rely on other people, who can swing their vote at any time, to make the decision which they consider right.",3,4,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about how cars can be computer driven. Some people would be in favor of such a thing where as others would not. I am in complete favor of them as I see it as a leap into the future. The computer-driven cars would allow the driver to be hands free when driving and doing something else such as paper work, on their phone, or even eating. The computer-driven cars would also use half as much fuel then a taxi saving tons of money. The cars would also have alerts and safty precautions just in case the driver doesn't feel safe and wants to take over on his or her own. I am in favor for these future cars because they will allow the driver to be hands free, save gas money, and have complete safety precautions as well.

Having a computer-driven car would allow the driver the ability to multi-task and focus on his or her priorities. If a person forgot to fill out any paper work or even do their home work, they can now use the time from the drive to their destination to finish them. We can also have the advantage of eating on the go. If a person is running late and is yet to eat, they can use the time in their computer-driven car to eat as they will be hands free. The driver will even be able to have access to their cell phones on there car rides.

The computer-driven cars will surprisingly be using half as much fuel then a taxi. This lets the driver save a ton of money. It allows them to use their money on other things and not have to be driving. This will lower the ammount of polution as well making the computer-driven cars better for the enviornment.

The safety on computer-driven cars is fundamental. Every company on the verge of these future cars wants the safety to be at it's best. Each company puts as many sensors as the car needs for the safety of the drivers. Safety is the number one thing that desingers of these cars focus on and would not begin to sell them until they are fully sure that the buyers are safe, and the companies will put as many precautions as possible if a error occurs.

I am in favor for the computer-driven cars and highly agree that they will be in our future to stay. The cars will be here for the best of our future and will not fail in my eyes. The computer-driven cars will be very advanced and will allow the drivers to be hands free and use that time for priorities, save them a lot of money on fuel, and will be very safe and get us to our destinations. These cars are the future and are here to stay.",3,4,0,3,1,2,1,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""the author persents the topic on how the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents.

There are lots of thing to be leared about Venus so many things to elopre and discover. But there are aloso losts of dangers as well. For examlpe in the text it raeds,""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any of the planets in our solar system"", high heats in extermily dagerous thats one of the aine reasons Venus is hard to explore and have so many dificultys trying to learn more bout the plant its self. Another example as to why the study of Venus is difficault is its living coditions for examle in the text it states,""a thick atmosphereof almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blnkets Venus""this making it hard to even try to have a living thing on Venus. another exaple is in the text it states,""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atomophere""this adding on the the reasons as to why its difficult to even get close to evaluate data.

All though there are many more reasons and exaples on to why Venu is a worthy peruit despite the dangers it presents these are a few of the exampls and resons.",1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"How would life be with less usage of cars? Some advantages of limiting car usage would be less congestion, another would be the reducing of smog, and it wil also curb the greenhouse gas emissions. Are cars a danger to the world's enviroment? ""After days of near-record pollution,Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" People are trying to find ways of limiting car usage for the world's sake! People also having communities limit the use of car transportation to have to much car traffic.

To begin with, an advantange of limited car usage would be less congestion. If there was less congestion citizens could get to places without the risk of a car accident, the verdant streets of cities would be less crowded, and more space would be available for events such as parades, concerts, field days, and etc. A media trainer and mother of two said,""When i had a car i was always tense."" "" I'm much happier without the use of it."" Without cars communities get more a peaceful sound. ""As she walked the verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drawn out the occasional distant motor."" But less car traffic isn't one of the only advantages to the limited car usage; there would also be less smog.

In addition to, The reducing of smog would also be another advantage of limiting car usage.",1,3,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
"You should join the seagoing cowboys. A seagoing cowboy is where you go over seas and take care of animals to help a country.

"Having feeling or no feeling?I agree with this new advanced technology being placed in a classroom setting because it is educational and beneficial to students because being in an educational setting,it may make it more entertaining and fun for students to learn about the expressions of one another.Students are able to learn about the importance of expressions and this new expression technology could be great for a psychology course,for students to learn how the mind and emotions work.It could also be a great source for students in an anatomy course.This device could not only be used for students to learn about different expressions but various technologies put within the device to help determine a persons feeling and or expression.

When reading this article I came across Dr.Huang mentioning how the artist of this painting (Leonardo De Vinci) studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specicfic emotions.With new advanced technology,students are able to use it to calculate one another's expressions and learn about human anatomy and how the face muscles work togther to form an expression.Which could potientially be used for an anatomy course.

Having an emotional expression advanced piece of technology will motivate students to be more interested in learning more about the characteristics of facial muscles and emotions within.It will be useful for everybody to be involved such as shy students or students who always look mad,like mentioned in the article we can easily judge or misinterpurt ones expression just by the look on their face,but with this technology students are able to learn about their classmates expressions without being confused about why they always look mad or sad.

With new computer softwares,they are able to store ones emotions and it is similar to anatomical information as the electronic code.Using video imagery,the new emoton-recognition software tracks facial movements allowing students to see and learn different expressions.I see it as a way for students to connect with one another even though the emotion-recognition classies six basic emotions students are able to know the others emotion and go on from there.This is a great way for students to interact with one another respectfully and entertainingly.

In conclusion,I believe that this piece of technology is very valuable to be placed in a classroom with students because of the benefits brought along with it such as learning about the importance of expressions.This new technology will help determine a student's action and behavior.This is great and valuable object to have around in some classrooms such as psychology,anatomy,and technology courses.Overall this would benefit and assist alot of students.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"There are many advantages of not using a car. Its a good opportunity to lower air population, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. In addition everyone is getting active instead of using a car to transport them where they need to go.

Passangers are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe. 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the united states. Not using cars can lower air populations. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capitol of france after 5 intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most populated cities in the world. after baning even numered license plates the smog cleared enough.

Another advantage in not using cars is everyone getting active. Instead of everyone driving everywhere millions of people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. People are interacting with each other. many people have said that it has releaved stress and lowered air population. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into connected network to save time, coserve resources lower emmissions and improve safety.

"Cars have made a drastic impact on the world as a whole; however, times are begining to change in the necessity of cars and personal trasportation. Other countries, such as France, Germany, and Columbia has worked on reducing cars in their society. The benifets from the sucess, expensives, and health qualites have increased in the low-car communities. Accoring to Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Moter Company stated in paragraphs 43""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve rescources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Basically explaining that cars are not as needed and countries all over the world, inlcuding America can reduce, if not emliminate personal vechiles.

In Freiburg, Germany, the streets of this community are car-free, show in paragraph 2. Instead of cars they have trams to assist them in their travels. On average, a car space is $40, 000, not including the actual home. This dictrict is trying to remove the use of cars not just becasue of expenses, but also for health from smog and other possible harms. Cars are quoted as ""cash traps"" from the continual expenses needed to pay in paragraph 32. In America, they produce up to 50% of gas emissions in certain locations; whereas, Europe only gets to about 12% in paragraph 5. America is one of the most fuel wasting countries and causing damages and polutions. In addition, their expenses of appropriationgo to about 80% of highways androad work and only 20% to other trasportations.

Columbia dircects ""Day Without Cars,"" which is to alude citizens to other forms of transportation and to reduce smog in paragraph 21. If a person were to violate that day and use a personal vechile, he/she would be fined. The affect of this day has decresed smog, traffic, danger, and stress. Communites have more connection and environment  becasue of the simple reduction. Plazas, shops, restaurants, sidwalks, and bicycle trails have been upgraded for the citizens to enjoy due to less cars. These countries may increase health from the consistant walking and apprearance of the environment.

In conclusion, by limiting car usage, citizens expensives, enviroment, and health are benifited as shown in these articles. Expenses will be converted to other aspects within the community, like the style in Columbia with upgrades on the society. Smog, gasses, and other safety/ health factors will decreses from a reduction in cars. Overall, the reduction in cars will be benifical of society around the world.",2,2,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Venus the Hardest Planet to Explore

Venus is the hardest planet to explore because the ships only last a few hours on Venus,it has high tempertaures than Mercury even though Mercury is closer,and its weather conditions and atmosphere are bad compared to ours.

First, reason why Venus is hard to explore is because that the spacecrafts can only stay for a few hours. Since the planets have different orbitational speeds sometimes Earth and Venus are closer in some ways. So humans decided to send spacecrafts over to explore .There were a few previous missions that were unmanned. Not one spaceship has survived the landing. So for more than three decades there has not been one spaceship that has touched down on Venus for that specific reason.

Second reason is that Venus's temperatures are very high in scale. Even though Mercury is the closest to the sun Venus's temperatue is still higher. Venus's temperature can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. which is 90 times greater than Earth's temperature. Even the deepst parts of Earth's ocean can liquefy any metals. So putting a submarine in the deepest parts of our ocean can damage the metals around it.

Finally thr third reason is that Venus's weather conditions and atmosphere are dangerously bad. On Venus there are many powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning stikes, and erupting volcanoes. The atmoshere contains 97% of carbon dioxide blankets. That being said humans wouldn't be able to live on Venus.

in conclusion Venus is the hardest planet to explore because the ships only last a few hours on Venus,it has high tempertaures than Mercury even though Mercury is closer,and its weather conditions and atmosphere are bad compared to ours.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. Exploring Venus could be challenging because of it's geology and critical living conditions but study of scientists and astronomers are fascinating it similar as the planet we live in which could be a worthy pursuit despite the danger.

Venus is the closet planet to the Earth and it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is a chllenging place to examine. Venus's temparature and atmospheric pressure is more than the Earth it could be a risky place for a human being to survive or live at but besides danger on this planet, Venus once maybe was one of the planet that is most likely Earth a long time ago. In the articles ""The Challenge of Exploring Venuse"" it states that ""On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure sis 90 times greter than what we experiene on our own planet."" this concludes that Venus is a dangerous place to survive at because it's near to the sun too. In the article ""Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system, Even though Murcery is closer to sun."" this defenses the claim of danger on Venus is. It also causes erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes as well. Besides all danger Venus is somehow a worth pursuit, "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and carters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a plantery visit,"" this tells that it also have so many features as like Earth. Venus has to get up close and personal despite the risks for making the misson safely for scientist to product. As like many scientist are working on thier mission for Venus through the specific devices they've made to approch for studying Venus. NASA also has been working on it for a while.

Venus is a worthy prusuit despite the dangers it presents and tells us about in the article. Exploring Venus and challenges that might explorers would face through the exploraion. A human could accomplish any thing while living on Earth easily traveling from one corner to the other corner of the planet. On Venus human has dangerous living conditions but scientists study might worths more than the danger and in future there are easy and safe ways for explorers to aknowledge about the ""Evening Star"".",2,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In today's world there are many new ideas and thoughts people come up with to try and help the world be a better place. Most of these ideas dont get very far but one that really could make a differance has caused whole countries to take action. The whole idea of having or not having cars can be very controverscial. It gives people the idea of following this idea and trying it out.

Multipule countries have already tested this care-free question and it has come to be beneficial and very interesting for the cities. Of course there is the ups and downs to this idea but overall it has caused more and more cities to go out and try it. Banning the use of cars has helped not only people being lazy but also the enviornment. Cars produce strong chemicals that infect the air and create harm to the enviornment. Europe is on of the most polluted cities than anywhere else in the world. A main part of this pollution comes from the chemicals that comes out of cars. When people in Paris stopped using their cars; the air cleared. This just goes to prove that cars are truly bad for the enviornment.

The world has seen a great decrease in the number of drivers in the past decade. This means that with less drivers, less cars being driven. Especially in the United States the amount of drivers has decreased in numbers. People are coming up with new ways to get around that are a lot more efficiant. Michael Sivak who is a professor at the University of Michigan has found that the number of drivers between the ages of 16 and 39 have dropped largely.

Another positive outcome if this idea is the saving of time and money being spent on roads and other things that are used for driving. Of course walking or riding your bike to work may not sound very easy and but in the long run, it is. Of course, you may have to change your daily routine but it will help a bigger cause.

In counclusion; the world needs a change and the answer is sitting in front of our faces. In order to make this world a better place we need to stop the excessive use of vehichles and start using more efficiant ways of transportation. There will always be those that disagree but we should be more focused on a safer world than a few angry people.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I think the computer the students are using to identify human emotions is valuable. It could useful for many things in the world or can use for important uses like if people are lying. This techology could be helpful to scientists for many uses or like in the article says for identify paints or surgeries. In the following paragraghs i will give my reason why its a good reason to the FACS and evidenece.

The reason i agree that they should have the FACS is because it could be used for alot of things like see who is confused or lost, and if someone is lying when they are introuble, and even if they need it for a painting like this artcle. I think people always questioned if mona lisa is happy or mad, or even confused. In the artricle on paragraph 3 it says that the computer can classifi if someone or some painting is happy, sad, anger, fear, and disgusted. So what they did is they made the painting 3-d and scanned her face to see what was her emotions were during da vinci was painting and also it says that the computer can also major 44 muscles on our face and can tell if we are happy or sad. on paragraph 1 the result of what emotion mona lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful andf 2% angry. this result could be right or just what the computer thinks what her emotion was in that very moment da vinci was painting her.

In conclusion i do think FACS is valuable because it could help figuring out emotions on people in paintings like da vinci, help during surgery, help the teacher know if people did understand the lesson or not, and help people know who is lying or not.",1,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hello I am Luke Bomberger and i'm going tell why you to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can prove how a person is feeling due to having a 3-D computer model, an electronic code, and a facial software.

First, the FACS has a 3-D computer model to help it figure out a persons emotion. In the text it says, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a humans muscles."" This evidence shows that a humans facial muscles shows how a person is feeling and each emotion has their own charateristics.

Second, the FACS also has an electronic code which helps the system understand better the emotion just kanda how us as humans can tell if our friend is upset or happy. For example in the text it says, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This evidence shows that the software has the same kind of thing that lets us humans know how our friend is feeling.

Lastly, the facial software helps FACS by using human features on the face understand the emotions. In the article it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This evidence shows that even a computer software can tell what you're feeling by your face features.

I think the FACS should be used to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom. Having a 3-D computer model, an electonic code, and a facial software sure can all help Facial Action Coding System recongize a humans emotion.",1,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" introduces the idea that driverless cars are almost ready. My argument of driverless cars is, are they ready? Who is to blame if an accident happens? The manufacturer or the owner? Which the narrator also asks, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" The premise of my argument, is that the driver, should in no way be the one at fault. Unless they themselves wreck the car.

Driverless cars are a very unique sort of car. For one, they do not need a driver. In most cases, that is. Driverless cars have one factor that many car companies are working on: they also need a driver. Which makes them half driverless and half driver... full? BMW driverless cars can only go to about 25 mph (miles per hour), ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph,""

before needing assitance by the driver behind a wheel. GM has driver seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, ""...driver's seats that vibrate..."" Also, the Google car just says whenever the person is required to take over. ""...simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""

What if a special needs/ disabled person uses one of these cars? Are the manufacturers going to blame them for not being able to use their own hands and feet on the vehicle? This is another scary thing that could very well happen in the future. At least a person without some kind of disability would have control of the car if the autopilot did indeed fail. My counter-argument to my argument would be that there are plenty of sensors around the car stated in paragraph 4, ""...they needed a whole lot of sensors,"" but, what if the senors failed? What if every single sensor failed and someone was incapable of controlling the car? Who is responsible?

My argument is not one that can be answered right now. It is just a question that many could use an answer from. The well-being and capability of the car is an important aspect of said car. Many bad accidents could happen and whether or not the accident is pinned on the car maker or the car driver is to be disputed.",2,2,3,3,2,2,2,3,2
"To many, it is a necessity. To others, its a waste of money. Cars have been a growing industry ever since the Model-T, but over the last few years automobiles may soon start to look like a thing of the past. There have been many efforts to reduce car use because it is better for the enviorment, creates a more social atmosphere, and the best of all it is cheaper.

Could you imagine major streets, cities, and highways almost deserted of those four wheeled gas guzzlers? Well annualy in Bogota, Columbia citizens participate, or for many ""celebrate"" no car day. Other forms of transportation such as skating, biking, or walking are very common as violaters of no car day face twenty five dollar fines. Many enjoy the holiday like Carlos Plaza, who rode his two-seat bike to work with his wife. It is a day to be socializing with others, not locked up in your vehicle but to get out and enjoy the fresh air before it is all polluted and blown out the exhaust. The day alone has caused a blooming of parks, and restraunts throughout the city. With less drivers out on the road, this day is traffic free and extremely safe as well. This is not only a common trend in Colombia, but is beginning to be seen in the United States as well. Teens have begun using their summer-life to being in carpools or riding the bus to not only get around enviormentally, but to also meet and be with freinds and develop a more social community. This can be seen through carpooling apps and cell phones to arrange other forms of transportation.

Over the years there has been a push to use more eco-friendly cars such as hybrids, or electric cars. But what about not driving a car at all? Many have made this change in Vauban, Germany where residents of this upper-class community have gone motor free, and given up cars. This suburban area alone is a  huge effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, similar to citizens in paris who have lost their driving privledges due to the extreme ammount of smog in their city. By banning odd numbered plates from driving on monday, and even numbered plates from driving on tuesday, pedestrians hopped on trams and bicycles to commute the rest of their day. Each time you firie up your engine, carbon monoxide and other pollutious gas is released into the atmosphere, causing a widening hole in the ozone layer affecting Global Warming. In this two-day restriction, smog was significantly reduced throughout the city.

Many gimmance and frown as they fill up their gas tank, knowing they just spent forty dollars on gasoline, and will be right back at the same pump next week. Money makes the world go around, and spending less on cars, highways and other expenses could brighten anyones day. It is absolutely free to get to work on a bicycle, and New Yorks bike sharing program has significantly jumped inthe last few years as many would rather use manpower than horsepower to travel. Not just bikes but other services are cheaper as well like taking the bus, the few dollars for a bus pass or a train ticket is much less than a new toyota. The infamous no car day in Colombia has influenced money to be spent on wide, and smooth sidewalks for bikers instead of million dollar highways. Due to the recession, many are not buying cars or getting their license simply because they dont have the resources to afford one. Some believe the idea of a personal car is impractical says Bill Ford of Ford Motor Company. Bill believes it is best to use the comercial network of transportation for its lower cost, eco friendly, and a safer enviorment on the road.

Since the beginning of man all forms of transportation have been used, but are cars starting to become a thing of the past? On paper, the idea of not owning personal cars looks great. The enviorment would improve significantly, daily interactions with comuting to work develops a more social enviroment, and is of course cost reductive. So every once in a while don't be afraid to pedal the old Shwinn or hop on the Greyhound, it just might be better than you think.",4,3,3,4,1,2,3,3,2

"Driverless cars may be safer than cars completely controlled by humans, but it would be boring and would put various people out of a job. Driverless cars made by Google have, according to the information in the passge, driven more than 500,000 miles without a crash. But they still aren't completely driverless, leaving us humans to take care of complicated navigation that would make more risk of crashes. Driverless cars would take the fun of driving away from everyone who enjoys it. As well as take away a certain freedom that driving cars gives from the people who want it.

First off, some people may be bad drivers, but that does not mean that we as people are incapable of driving safe enough to not injure ourselves or others on the road. Driverless cars would illeminate the risk of crashes by people, according to the passage. But what if the car were to have a glitch in the system and the 'driverless taxis' all of a sudden needed a driver but they don't even have a wheel for a human to take control of? More crashes and companies getting sued. The risk for a car accident is not very high in general, give or take a few factors based on a persons sleep or wether or not they are under the influence of a substance. Driverless cars are still at risk for crashes, just like human-controlled cars.

Many people, like myself, have fun driving around with friends and having the freedom to do that with a car that I can control. If I were put inside a driverless car with my friends, I wouldn't be able to see how beautiful the world was outside as I was driving. I would be too distracted by my friends and the lack of responsibility to be focused to noticed what a beautiful world we live in. Also, the freedom that having a drivers license gives is just an amazing feeling that should not be taken away just by some 'technological advances.'

On the aspect of jobs, delivery men/women would be unemployed because the world would not need them to drive supplies around the country for stores or construction because we would have could that can drive themselves as well as the resources to the desired destination without hassle or a human in the front seat, or even the vehichle as a whole.

Finally, driverless cars are not needed in our world. Deaths and accidents will still happen if we develop driverless cars due to malfunctions, creativity and a sense of freedom will be taken away from us as citizens, and various people would be out of a job because they will not be needed to deliver resources to any store or company any longer.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"I personally am all for the driverless cars idea. Through time, everything has evolved and is still eveolving to newer and better ideas of the original. For example, we started with little shacks, now we have skyscrapers, we rode horses now we have cars, we had mail, now we have email or texting, the point I am trying to make is everything needs to evolve for us to improve anything. Technology is a big part of our lives today and we rely on it for most of anything and everything.

Every year we have thousands maybe millions of deaths and injuries resulting from car crashes, the fact of the matter is, people are irresponsible and reckless. We have drunk driving, texting and driving, and simply just not paying attention that causes all these wrecks and I believe that driverless cars could solve all these problems and save a lot of lives.

Driverless cars could also solve other problems such as gas prices. In the story it mentions that driverless cars use half the amount of gas as taxis do and they are way more efficient. People could have a lot more money spending half the amount of money they usually do on gas. Do you know how much money people spend on gas? A lot. So these are the reasons that I am all for driverless cars, it's the next big thing, why would we say no to that?",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Bang! Your brand new driverless car has just made a mistake and you rear ended the other driverless car infront of you, whose to blame? You weren' driving the car but you own the car. How do you explain the accident to your insurance? Driverless cars may with daily commute, but the risk heavily outweight the advantages. These cars should not be developed because: they are more prone to accident, harder to properly regulate and the idea simply isen't practical.

Imagine that you are taking a long, overnight road trip and everyone in the car is tired from a busy week. Good thing you have a driverless car that can drive for you right? Wrong. Engineers have yet to deveop a car that requires no human help at all. For this reason, a human still has to be there to navigate the car. Since the car does most of the work, the human is more likely to pay less attention to the car. What happens when the car requires human help but the driver doesen't pay attention? Does it just keep driving into the construction sight and run into a worker? Or does it stop in the middle of the road and get rear ended by the car behind it? ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver. And what prevents people from hacking into the cars and taking control of them? If hackers can hack into the white house, then surely they can hack into a soccer mom's station wagon.

The goal of having regulations on drivers are to keep the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. So how do you regulate a car that doesen't have a driver? Who is at fault if the car malfunctions or is hacked into and causes an accident? How will the person who owns the driverless car's insurance policy be affected if the his is responsible for the accident? Also, what if not everybody can afford a driverless car? How do you regulate cars when there are both driverless cars and cars that require drivers on the road at the same time? These are just a few of many questions that must be answered in order dor driverless cars to be developed. For these reasons, I beleive that the challenge of regulating driverless cars is is to complex and would create to many issues; therefore the development is not a practical idea.

Inconclusion the development of a driverless car is not practical unless dramatical innovations occur. The creation of a driverless car greatly increases the risk of an accident and simply isen't practical for insurance purposes. The idea of having a driverless car may sound very interesting to some, but the risks far outweight the advantages. For these reasons. I beleive that, unless some type of revolutionary technolgy is developed, driverless cars will never successfully be developed.",3,3,2,3,0,1,2,2,1
"There has always been a debate on how we should electe our president. There always will be. Someone always has a new idea or plan for the future. After giving it quite some thought I have come to the conclution that changing to eletion by popular vote is the best way to elect our predent. Not only if it the most effcient way but its also the most fair way. I belive this for many reasons and I hope you can see that this is the path to sucess.

One out of the vasriety of resons why we should not keep the electoral college and change it to election by popular vote is that electoral college is unfair. Its unfair because of the winner take all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chnce of winning. A perfect example of the flaw is during the 2000 campain, seventeen staes didnt see canates at all. Its unfair outdated and irrational and we need to do something about it now.

Also the electoral college can cause the disater factor. The american people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisist. The system is going to cause problems and it needs to be removed as soon as posiable. If we keep going at this rate we will end up with a disater so big that wont be fixable. The election by popular vote can fix this. Its a fair and equal system that peope will agree with. It allows them to have a say in the election. They feel herd, dont you want to make the people happy.

As you can see clearly the option of election of popular vote is the only way to fix this madness. These are just a few of the thousands of reasons why we need the change. the system we have now is going to crash and burn and there will be no recover. i know you know what is right so make the change that will put us on top. Not only do we want this we need this. i hope you can see that senator. I cant articulate how drasticly is will improve the election process. thankyou for your time and have a nice day.",2,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it persents, because he or she feels very strongly that there is more to Venus then we think. Many people think that Venus is a star because of the nickname it was given ""Evening Star,"" but it is really a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun. From a distance we are safe but is has been one of the most challenging planets to examine closly.

The author thinks that Venus is worth learning more about because it is the most earth like panet in the solar system. It has shown signs of various forms of life, oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. With these shocking findings many scientists will be wanting ti find out more avout the dangrous planet. Venus is an extreamly hard planet to acess safely. The atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and it coveres the entire planet of venus. The more challenging part of landin gon Venus id the cloud that are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. when you get to the actual part of the planet the temperatures avrage of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atnosphere is 90 tmes greater then on earth. To get there safely the only way would to hover about 30 miles over the planet.

Although studying Venus is a dangrous activity there are other soultions to getting there safely. Many scientists are working on finding a way to make the machines last long enough fo us to gather information and samples. Finding a soultion that will work for in the harsh ennviroment that Venus brings is going to be very diffcult. The scientists are going to have to extra hard to get something that can stand the conditons. The idea of studying such a dangerous planet can be a little unsettling, you have to know all the things that could go wrong and how to prevent them and you also have to be prepared for everything. The author thinks that studying venus is a good idea even though is is dangerous because he or she knows that there is more to it then we can see. For all we know there could be forms of life on there. Studying Venus will do good for the people working at NASA and all the other who study our solar system because it will bing in more information about things that have happend and why some things happen on earth today.

The article states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imigination and innovation."" This quote from the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" sums up the whole point in which we should not let the diffculties get in our way of discovering more and more. Scientist want to explore and learn more about Venus not because they just want to but because it has value. Learning more about Venus will likely lead us to many more good things. Even though venus is a dangrous place to explore and study its worth a chance, there are so many good things that can come out of it. If one day we are able to produce equipment that can withhold the conditions Venus brings us we will unlock so many new things. Goog things can come out of the bad.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"I agree with the authors perpose with studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. Venus is the second plant away from the sun and the Earth's twin. At first it was called the Evening star because it's one of the even and brightest points of light in the night sky. We all know that it's completely different from the Earth's atmosphere. Theres a rick going to venus becuase of all the lost signals from there and there's probably no life in the other planet.

The thick atmosphere that is 97% carbon dioxide is Venus there is no life in that planet nothing. The clouds are higly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus and the weather over there its crazy 800 degress fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greather Earth's. So why to NASA and everyone wants to study the planet venus, is it for a project,research,are they planning on going there we don't know but soon we will know. There's probably something living on venus planet right now and that we don't know about if they try to find it it will be difficult to find because of the lost signals they had before. Before people think that this planet Venus had a body water.

The author has a point with the statement he said with out risk and a lot of courage there can not be nothing. That's the whole point of everything is people didn't take risk where would they be today where would the people be at right now. It would be hard to get there and NASA can not get no sample of rocks, gas, or anything else froma distance. Scientist even said it, it would take risk and a lot of challenges for them to reach Venus. we will get there on day it wont be today or tomorrow but if the keep pushing and working hard the will reach Venus one day.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Getting rid of the electoral college would be illogical and irrational. The electoral college was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers to compromise between the Congress and the people. It is seen as non-democratic to the modern day system because the electors elect the president, not the people because when you vote for a presidential election you are actually voting for a slate of electors. Many people say that ""what if they go against your wishes"" but the truth is that it rarely happens. So there is no reason to wory. We must retain the Electoral College depite it being ""non-democratic"" because we will be certain of our outcome, avoid run-off elections, and Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have.

""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible - it happened in 2000 - but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" in paragraph 18 meaning that winning the candidates share of electoral votes over powers his share of popular votes. ""In 2012's election, for example, Obama recieived 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" in paragraph 18 shows how almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis. So even if there was a slight popularity it creates a land slide in that state.

Having an Electoral College avoids the problem of having an election where no candidiate recieves the majority of votes. For example in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both only had 43% plurality of popular votes. Which meant they were tied and meant of a run on election. However, having the Electoral College produces a clear winner. In paragraph 23 it says ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state - Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California.""(paragrpgh 23) Meaning that they might not even vote if it's not going to count for anything.

Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states have by population. For example in the 2012 election the popular vote was very close in Florida and Obama got the vote with 29 electoral votes. ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" because they mean more. (paragraph 21)

Many say that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winnter take all system in each state. However, why would you soend time in a state that you know they have no chance of winning. It would be a waste of time and money. That is why they focus on the swing states.

The Electoral College method of selecting the president could cause potential voters not to vote anymore because they don't see why they would if it doesnt count for anything. However no voter's vote swings a national election. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think what a single vote may decide on an election.""(paragaph 23) This just shows how we should let the electoral college decide who will be running our country, not the people.",4,3,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
"Venus is the planet in our Solar System , which is second planet from our Sun.I is also known as ""Evening Star"".Venus is simple to see from the Earth.Earth is a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus.But no spacecraft unmannned landing for few hours.not a single spaceship have touched the land for three decades.Venus has 97 percent of carbon dioxide and sulphuric acids atmosphere and on planet surface it is 800 degree Fahrenhiet.it is 90 times greater than we experience on our planet,such a environment would crush the submarine deep in the ocean andd will liquefy metals. Long ago Venus was just like Earth.The planet has a rocky sedimentand includes familiar features like valleys mountains,and craters.The National Aeronautics And Space Administration (NASA) has compelling idea to send humans to study Venus.At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at sround 170 degrees Fahraniet,but air pressure would be close to sea levelon Earth.solar power would be pleniful.Not easy conditions,but survivable for humans. Peering Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the plant can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because more forms of light cannot penetrate dense atmosphere.Researchers cannot take samples pf rocks,gas or anything else from a distanceMany researchers are working along the innovations that would allow our machines to last long enoughto contribute kowledge of Venus

.NASA is working on other approaches of studying Venus.For example, mechanical computers,simplified electronics made by silicon carbide.System that use mechanical parts can be made more reisitant to pressure,heat,and other forces.challenge presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equallly intimidating endeavors.Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the every edges of imagination and innovation.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Do you want a future where you are cabable of driving but you can not because of a silly robotic car? I personally think driverless cars are a waste of time and money, a driverless car is not any better than a normal car. I am sure there will be less accidents but there will always be those people that do not pay attention to the surroundings around them and will cause accidents. As in paragraph 9 the text states, ""As a result, in most

states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing limited use of semi-autonomous cars;... Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident, If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" If someone where to get into an accident, it would be both the driver and manufacturers fault, first off the driver should have been paying attention to the road and their surroundings no matter who is driving. Secondly, the manufacturer should have more technology where the car can stop itself when there is about to be an accident. If companies want to bult driverless cars they need to make them smarter than the average human, just in case of any distractions the car should have some type of sensor that will stop the car or turn it in a different direction. Coming from a teenager driverless cars is not something we want in the future, some of us want to experience driving ourselves. If companies want to build something for the future, make a car that can tell when someone is doing something illegal. For example: drunk driving, texting, driving, etc. there are more deaths from those two alone. We need a car that is going to keep people one hundred percent safe. Driverless cars just do not have the right ""smarts"" for the future, the only thing the driverless cars do is steer, acceletare, brake themselves, and notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills. That is not good enough, we need sometime ten times better! If companies can spend so much money building these driverless cars they can take the time to add features where the car can control itself. Until that happens we will happily stick with our power fueled cars we have now with that being said, that is the reason we should not have driverless cars... they are not entirely safe! What if the driverless cars have a glitch of some sort and hurt way more people than intended? SAY NO TO DRIVERLESS CARS!",3,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,1
"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is something new the world is bringing. When I read this, their are both possitive and negative things happening. I am against the idea of having driverless cars. There could be many things that can go wrong with a car driving on its own. I strongly belive having all these fantastic ideas that your driverless car can do to be save but, this could be more deadly then somone driving on their own.

Driverless cars are just like robots. Robots can easily break down for all different reasons. When a robot breaks down, it starts to act all crazy like and the person can no longer control what the robot is doing. That could happen with the driverless car. If a person was on a highway heading somewhere and their driverless car starts to break down, it could start acting up. It wouldn't just put the driver in danger, it could affect someone else in the car or on the road too. The driverless car could start to not be able to control itself and go off the road or, have buttons on the car to turn on to do something not needed. Anything with a driverless car could be bad or go wrong.

To get your license, you have to take driving test and go threw classes all just to get your permit and license. Wants you finally have your license you can go off and drive. The people who were able to get their license were smart, responsible and independent people. When your on the road, you should

always be careful no matter what. You are the adult driving with your license being save. Why have a car driving you around places. What's the point working so hard to get your license when you have a car driving for you. All that hard work would be pointless. Also, in the article it talked about how the person with the driverless car would be board just waiting to take a turn to drive.

In conclusion, people who get there license want to drive. They like to drive. Why have a car drive for you when your smart enough to drive somewhere. It's more safer to drive on your own because, your smart and always aware when something is wrong. Your driverless car can detect that too but your alive, not your car. Lastly, in the article it talked about how it was illegal to have driverless cars in some states like California, Nevada, Flordia and District of Columbia. If other states allow driverless cars, the people in the states that can't get them would be mad and jelouse. They would think that would be unfair. If you only own driverless car you would have to rent or buy a car just to go to those states like Flordia to go to Disney World. I strongly belive the savest way is to drive on your own without anything controling you.",3,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1

"Driverless cars are beingcoming more and more common with each day that the technology is evolving. I believe that in the next 30 years we will have driverless cars all over the place.

Many car companies today are well on their way to developing driverless cars, simple autonomous cars have been tested since 2009, with many car companies rushing to learn what they can about it. The reason it wasn't happening before then was because they lacked the technology. Back then, a radar was an object on a hill that cost over 200 million dollars, not something you could put on a car and use to help it on the roadways.

Driverless cars are not a bad idea, they can improve safety because they are more precise and can respond quicker to any situation thrown at them by todays everchanging road ways and transportation infrastructure. If we can improve driver and passeneger safety, why not take the chance to develop something for the future. So far, many of the tests on these cars have proven successful 90% of the time. Volvo hopes to have their first driverless car publicly available in 2020.

"The Electoral college is a place were they elect the presidant of the united states and the congress choose if they put a vote in for that presidant and his people.

The presidential election is held at the electoral college i think that why would you have the electoral college when you can just vote some other way insted of having this big thing just to elect the presidant and the vice presidant why can't you just have a regular meeting deciding if you are voting for that presidant and the vice presidant the electoral college to me makes no sense why would you have this big thing that makes no sense at all if you wanted to vote for the presidant then vote i dont get why you have to go through a big system just to vote i think its just easier just to vote a regular way and it takes so long and it also depeneds on what state you are in and how you have to vote in texas if you wanted to vote for a certain person you would have to vote for the slate of 34 or what the number of that person is like for example if you voted for Jhon Kerry you would have to vote for slate of 34 democratic electors it just depends on the state. what if there was a tie the election it would be thrown into the house of representatives where the state delegations vote on the presidant and the vice presidant cause only each state casts one vote a single representatives from Wyoming representing 500,000 voters. this is why i think we should not have the electoral college becuase it causes to much cauase throught all the steps you have to go through it takes so much time up and there is so many other thing we can be focusing on i think the electral college needs to be gone and over with and we need to find other ways to vote for the presidant and the vice presidant.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Venus is our sister planet and we should know more than what we already know. The extreme conditions are a challange but the facts that would come from exploring Venus would be very insightful.

The extreme conditions that are on Venus will be a challange. The high pressure, heat, erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning that strikes probes that try to land there are not the best situatuion to be in. We have not found material or built a robot that can handle all of that for a long period of time. The weather would take the robot out before it got really good info.

NASA may have found a possible solution to this obstacle. Using older technology might be able to handle the conditions. Also having newer technology to float 30 miles above the ground to minimize damage. The problem with that is we wouldn't be able to get close enough to get samples or to explore as much as we would be able to if we had a strong robot.

Being curious beings is challanging and difficult but it is fun to have something that isn't that easy. Exploring Venus our sister/twin planet will be hard and expensive but nothing we can't do.

What if that was not what you had to hear all the time? What if that sounds would only be heard once every few hours or days? Thus can be a reality with limitation of car usage; people would be happier, there would be less smog in the sky, the global health would go up.

With less cars comes less trouble. in Andrew Selsky's artical ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" he states "" millions of Colombians Hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work tduring car-free day"" this caused the ""streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Because of the car-free day there were less people on the road, less traffic, and less stress about getting to work. When there is no one driving and almost everyone is taking bikes or walking, it seems like it would make small sidewalks congested; it does not, because, as Andrew Selsky says, ""throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks..."" This helps make transit even easier and less hectic. In Elisabeth Rosanthal's artical, ""In German Suburb, Life Gose On Without Cars,"" she asked someone in a car-less community how they felt about not having a car, she said ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.'"" People are happier without cars and without the stress that comes with them. Having less cars would also make places less polluted.

With less cars there would be less pollution in the air and less greenhouse gases that we would emit as a society. In Robert Duffer's artical, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" he states that "" after days of near-record pollution"" in Paris the city officials ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air opf the globay city. In Paris action was only taken when the smog made carrying out their day difficult, instead of before it got to that point. Some might say that if the imediate threat had not been there none of the citizens would have lisened to the ban; but they might listen to the banning of cars now that they see how bad it can get. In Bogota, Andrew Selsky states that ""the goal [of the Day Without Cars] is to promote alternitive transportation and reduce smog."" This helps the enviroment and the people living there, especially those with asthma; and those with heart disease can develop better exercise habits.

With less cars means more walking and less greenhouse gases. Many of the people that do not choose to ride the bus or a taxi, as Andrew Selsky says, ""hiked, biked"" or ""skated. This means that these people were exercising and getting fit, even if it was just one day. Imagine if it was not just one day though; what if car-free day was car-free week, or month. This would decrease obesity in children and adults, along with lowering the hisk for heart contitions. Car-free weeks or months would make the enviroment better but also make it better for people with asthma. Less smog would mean people with asthma would be able to breathe easier in places like New York. Improving the health of people on a global scale.

Limiting car usage would be an amazing thing if it was on a global scale. Car-free days once every year are a great start to improving the planet. Car limitation would mean happier people, less pollution in the sky, and an improved standard of living. Less cars equal a better planet for every one.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Well, first of all I agree with the new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systyem that enables computers to identify human emotions and I think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might be having some troubles fixing their emotions, and i'm not sure if the essay is to write about the teachers using it to read the students emotions or it is the students theirselves that are using it to read their own expressions, eitherway i'm going to write about the two topics. About what I said about the students fixing their emotions is that some of the students might be so emotional that any little thing like when someone curses them they start crying, they might want to use this technology to see how their emotions are high or low, so they keep track of it and reduce the emotions till their brave enough to face anyone without having a lot of fear in them. And some of the students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it before it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)

Secondly, about the other topic is that teachers might want to see how their students are feeling, maybe sad or they have something in their mind that is giving them trouble in school or anywhere, because some teachers care for their students and they could ask what the problem is and the teacher might make the student happy by relieving them from the pain they had being through or stress, the student might even forget he/she had a problem because some teachers are good in making people smile like what the article says, ""Putting on a happy face"" actually works!""",1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0
"Computers that detect emotion would not be useful in a classroom because it would add extra work for teachers, and the computers wouldn't be immune to network problems and other things of that nature. They also probably will make mistakes in detecting emotions, and possible cause problems for students and teachers. There is also alot of contrversy on the data that computers already collect on their users everyday. With that why would parents want their childs emotional data collected and sold off to companys just to give them better ads. While there may be some good reasons for having emotion detecting computers the bad outweigh the good.

Computers knowing how their users feel would cause alot of problems for society as a whole, especially if it was implemented in schools. If this new technology was placed in our schools for everyday use, there is a high likelyhood that there would be many problems with it. Dr. Huang states,"" A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(D'Alto, 6) The idea behind this is brilliant; a computure will make class less boring and more understandable for students who may be struggling. The flaw in this logic is that teacher would have to make more than one lesson, and they would then have to put in the conditions in for which lesson the computer should give the children. This would add alot of extra work for a teacher where as if the teacher is instructing the whole class they can take a moment to clarify if students look confused, and then that is all and they can move on without having to make diffrent slides or another worksheet. Not only would the teacher have to put in more time, but the student would possibly be on a totally diffent page than the rest of the class due to diffrences in possible lessons. One other very likely problem that students will face is problems with the actual computer becasue it will lag, or they will have problems with the WIFI. Then how will the student be able to get their class work done.

There is also a lot of contrversy surronding the data that computers already collect on their users everyday. It would be safe to say that a majority of parents and gardians would not be fine with thier childrens emotional data being collected, and it then being sold off to give them better ads. Becase in all honesty children are not only using school computes for educational purposes, there are many students who are playing games, looking at articles, and in general not doing school work. There is also many times teachers tell students to look things up, and anytime something is looked up online there are ads. RIght now these ads are mostly targeted towards things that have been looked up in the past or things that have been clicked on. Dr, Huang says,"" For example, if you smile when a Web as appears on your screen, a simmilar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent."" (D'Alto, 6) Why would parents want Google ad generation to know you child looked at a random ad and just so happened to smile? It doesn't make any sense. Also not only does the program that caught that lovely smile know, but now the people the company owning that program sold it to know too. One thing that should not be sold for profit is someones emotional data.

Now the reasons that people would want emotion reading technogly in classrooms should be addressed. A student might do better in school should they be able to have a lesson almost entierly catering to their intrests.

Dr. Huang states,"" Then tit could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" ( D'Alto, 6) This would mean that the student would be able to have a lesson that they understand, and that they would be interested in. This would promote more learning and better grades.

This tecnology is a bad idea for teachers and students alike to have emotion reading techonlogy placed in classroom, and there would likey be an poutcry from the public to remove them due to their emotional information being sold to companies. The bad outcomes just outweigh the positives.",4,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Hi, I'm Kelvin and I go against this technology to read students emotional expressions. This is totaly BS, Dr. Huang and Pro. Nicu made this really cool software called the Facial Action Coding System. Calculating emotions is diferent from coding your face with a 3-D mode of your face that could barely even look like you. Plus there are more than the basic six emotion everbody has. It is still a very cool idea but not for us students.

Dr. Huang said that every facial emotion is universaly the same in paragraph 4, but some people can feel emotions without making that facial emotion on thier face. This software can be an evasion of privacy for students who would not like to be disterb by this software showing it to your teacher and then the teacher would call or give you a private lesson in school. Mixed emotions are even more complecated for the software to know. There are 44 major muscles in our faces are realy cool but, technology is not yet advanced for this to be true. And the Mona Lisa could just be happy.

How can this ""Facial Action Coding System"" even tell the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy. The technology is not advance enough to say what emotions we have. How can this software even know the emotions we have on a picture. The Mona Lisa is a painting not a picture, so that cannot be corect. Da Vinci Code is something different from Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms. Communication doesn't have to do anything with the software, but maybe us the students.

And finaly this stuff can't be used in public, who is going to use this sofware than the school. Video games are mostly the freedom of choice for most people . And emotional communication will still need to wait for technology to advance. Who is even gona use this. People do not caare what think about us the students. Making privat lessons based on our faces isn't a good idea. Many bad culd use this software to invade privacy from others.

And this is my reasons why I think this software sucks and should never be used.",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"The use of this in classrooms is unneccessary because there are a lot of classrooms, the readings would vary, and would not be 100% accurate. I would not expect for this technology to be having a use in schools.

To begin the argument, this would involve a lot of money for the computers and systems for this technology to be installed in a school. A small school, that has 30 to 40 classrooms, would need to provide a lot of money because of the amount and types of new technology needed. In paragraph 7, the article states, ""Your home PC can't handel the comoplex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". If this is the case, then most schools wouldn't be able to use the computers that they already have and would need to purchase newer, more expensive computers. Then the school would have to buy the equipment and hardware needed. Then it would all have to be installed.

Now from student to student, their moods will vary. Some may be talking to a friend and be focused on them and not the lesson. There could also be students focused on working on another class that they may need to catch up in. Others may have home life or something else affecting them and cause innacurate readings to be recorded.

There could also be misreadings from the system itself due to a malfunction or someone moving around too much. There are so many kids that move around so that the camera might not get a good look at them. There could be a hardware issue such as a dirty lense causing it to misread or even a miscalibrated sensor. Some kids might also know that they are being recorded and purposely try to mess with the algorithms to get the computer to change the lesson.

This technology does not have a super effective role in schools because there are just too many issues that come with it. The best and easiest way for a teacher to get feedback and talk with their students about what they want in the class.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,3,2
"People should do the Seagoing Cowboys program because just like I have been in it there are a lot of great things to do out there in the sea. I started out when I graduated in high school when my friend told me if I wanted to go to a trip to Europe. When I accepted to go to this trip to Europe I went to a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" program where I got to take care of animals like young cows, horses, and mules. This helped me how to take better care for animals.

Besides helping all the animals that I could I went on many trips as well. One of the trips that I went to was to China, and also went to a gondola ride to Venice, Italy, and a city with big streets of water. I even toured to an excavated castle in Crete, and even marveled at the Panama Canal when I was headed to a trip to China.

When I was crossing to the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States

it took two weeks and a Month to get to China. While I was waiting to get to China I got busy because I had to feed the animals and watered two or three times a day. I had to check up on them every hour and report to the captain. When the animals got unloaded I had some time to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had lived. After last that I was happy to go to the trips that I went to and helped me with things I will do in the future.",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,0,1
"I believe that disbanding electoral college would be in favor of most peoples decisions. This way everyone has a chance to vote decisively and not having electoral college decide who should be the president of the united states. Electoral college dosent let the people decide who they want to be president. It lets the lets the slate of electors decide which is totally un fair in my decision. People are the ones who elect which president they feel will make the United States a better country. Maby the slate of electors have a different decision in mind than what the people of america think about who should be president.

Popular vote would be much better in my decision because it gives everyone a chance on picking there president and not having other people pick it for them. Say there was a tie in the electoral votes, than they would be passed onto the house or reps were state  delegations vote on the president and not the people of america. There is a greater quantity of people than there are slate of electors and house of representitves. The electoral college is completely unfair to voters because in each state candidates dont spend time in states they dont think will help them win presidency. We the people dont have the ability to choose who we want as a president and we want our freedom of being able to do that. There will be less conflicts and anger from the people if they disband electoral college.

But in many eyes electoral college are in favor to those people. They think its right to have the slate of electors vote for who they think would be a better president. The electoral college does avoid the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. But it could lead to more pressure in the election process, which could greately complicate the presidential elections. There for saying that electoral college isint a good decision to have. People should decide what they want to have for this country. They should be able to take a mark and say we dont want electoral college anymore for the United States.

It would have to be weighted in an election of the people to decide what they want to have. Electoral college method of selecting a president may have a big impact on people by not choosing the president they want. Saying in the peoples minds that Electoral College should be disbanded and gotten rid of because it depends on what the people of the U.S. choose, not the slate of electors. We the people of the United States should have the freedom to choose what will make this  a better and stronger Country!",3,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0

"Do u ever want to go exploring Venus? Venus is a planet in our solar system. Venus is very challenging place to go. Earth and Venus are close bye. Venus is called the evening star one if the brightest point of light in the night sky. Venus is fun place to go exploring. Venus is the second planet from our sun.

Exploring planet is very danger. People can be die by exploring or can get injury. Its is so imporant. If some thing wrong people have to give their life away. In pargrpah 3"" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoosphere."" When you are going to exploring venus or othe planet you have to be careful. When some thing happend you will give you life away. Its so imporant

Theres some people name NASA they have explored Venus or other planet. They said that some simplified electronics mad of silicon carbide have been tested in chamber simulating the chaos of venus suface. They have a devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1440s during World War 2. Venus systems that used mechanical parts can be made mor resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces.

When you get to Venus you are flying you can't walk. The Venus a ship orbiting or hovering safely far abouve the planet can provide only limited insight on ground. In pargrpah 6"" More mportantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

"Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, ""Face on Mars?"" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the dangers it presents. Facing a lot of challenging things could be a difficult tasks to complete. In this situation, I think studying Venus is worth our time because NASA and others are trying to land on the surface or at least stay longer at the atmosphere to explore the planet; they can't just give up on what they already did, so there's no moving back or quitting the experiments for researching Venus.

Exploring Venus could be a very difficult tasks because many scientists figures that Venus has a harsh climate and is 90 times hotter than our planet surface. It is also the hottest surface temperature of any planets in our solar system, even though Mercury is the closest to the sun. This evidences might prove that it is impossible to reach Venus's surface, but in this modern date; I think we can accomplish something or a plan to reach Venus's surface much quicker than previous years, because more people are getting smarter these days. In the Venus atmosphere, it contains an highly corrosive acid called Sulfuric acid, it is a type of acid that reacts with other chemicals such as Sodium. We need a ship that prevents the acid from getting inside so that it won't destroy the plane or ship.

We could make a jet that by passes everything, such as storms like lightning tornadoes, and more. In paragraph 5, it talks about how it would be helpful if we were to make a jet that by passes or avoid any dangerous conditions on the surface of Venus. The temperature would be still overheated around 170 degrees Fahrenheit; but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth. There would be enough solar power and the radiation would not exceed Earth's level, It is not an easy conditions, but it is possible for a human to survive. It's possible to send a human to Venus, but I don't think he/she will make it back unharmed: because the temperature is so high in Venus.

In paragaph 4, it discusses about the environment in Venus having rocky sediment just like our planet Earth. Not that it's impossible to live in Venus right? I think it could be possible to live in Venus; after many centuries or decades, the planet could possibly decrease or cool down the temperature in the surface and could reduce acid in the atmosphere if we figure out how to destroy the acid or reduce the reactants. If Venus have landscapes like mountains, craters, valleys, and etc. Why not try to test observations or even explore? It is not easy to figure out or solve the problem, it will takes years, or it might not be even possible to test prototypes to land on Venus. We need a prototype ship that avoids any destruction that is doing to the jet. If we accomplish one, then maybe one day; we can explore and learn more about Venus.

These are the evidences and supporting details to why I think Venus is worthy our time even though it's dangerous.",3,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"The planet, Venus, has the potential for being a great place to visit and for sending people there, too. While it has some dangerous conditions, scientists have come up with a solution to oversee the planets atmosphere. According to NASA, ""the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This information shows that it is possible for people to, not live on Venus, but live above it without being harmed.

Astronomers have been studying Venus for a long time and they believe that the planet once had life on it. It makes even more sense for this to be true as Venus is one of the closest planets to the Earth. According to the author, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only that, but it has a large rocky surface with hills, mountains, and valleys. With all of the advanced technology we have in todays world, scientists can also find several ways to reduce the pressure and harsh conditions. This makes it even more safe to study further into the planet itself.

There are many ways we could think of to make sure that Venus is a safe and reliable planet, but many people still wonder of this amazing idea. If NASA can send people to the moon and send a machine on Mars, than who says we can't do the same with this gas planet? This discovery could be a great change to the world.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Luke thought it was fun to participate in a Seagoing Cowboys program. It was an adventure for Luke also. Luke got to play games and meet new people.

"People in America vote for a candidate running for president believing that their vote counts, but in reality it all comes down to the Electoral College. According to ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election tot he kind we have now."" We, as a country, need to change to election by popular vote for the president of the united states in order to have fair competion instead of the people of America voting for a potential president only to find out the vote was worth nothing.

To begin with, majority of the nation wants to abolish the Electoral Congress because it's an unfair process. Bradford plumer states, ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" It should be that the voters vote for the president, but we are just voting for electors so they can vote for the president putting our nation's future in danger. The Electoral College used to be the the right way of election but now it's known as something from the past. Traditionally, the Electoral College was ""a compromise between election of the president by a vote in Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens, (paragraph 1, by the Office of the Federal Register)"" in which the founding fathers established this process of election knowing that then it was the correct way. But now, this process is ""outdated (paragraph 14, Bradford Plumer)"" and there needs to be election by popular vote.

Another key point, former presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter, agree with ""abolishing the electoral college (paragraph 9,

Bradford Plumer)"" as do Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the AFL-CIO, and the Gallup poll in 2000. Majority wants to get rid of the Electoral College in order to lets the popular vote decide who become president. also, voters cant always control who their electors vote for. Bradford Plumer notes, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century."" The Al Gore election is an example of the unfairness that the Electoral College is pursuing. Al Gore won the popular vote against George W. Bush nationwide, which means the people wanted Gore, but he did not recieve enough electoral votes to win the election.

In the Electoral College's defense, the Electoral College, as illustrated by Richard A. Posner, ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution,"" meaning that a presidential candidate will give more attention to a larger state than a smaller state. Without the Electoral College, the president wouldn't have ""trans-regional appeal (paragraph 19, Richard A. Posner),"" meaning that no one region has enough electoral votes to elect a president so the Electoral College requires the ""trans-regional appeal.""

To conclude, our nation needs to change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States instead of election by the Electoral College because this process of election is unfair to the voters of this nation. Also, majority wins and the majority of the country wants to repeal the Electoral College then we should make a change. If we want this nation to be the strongest it can be then we need to make choices that will positively affect our country and the people of our country.",3,3,2,3,1,2,1,2,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys is mostly about helping other countries. We help them take care of the horses. They give us hay, and seeds to feed the horses.

We had to feed the horses, and cleaned there stables. If you like helping people, and animals than join. You have night watches each night, and you get to check on the horse each hour. We helped other countries such as China, Greece, Crete, and Europe. You also get to ride a boat called the SS Charles W.

You would get some spare time to go sightseeing. You would get to cross the Atlantic Ocean. On the return trips you get to play games. The games are baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. You get to meet new people. You could make some friends from different countries.

"Life without a personal vehicle may seem very hard of a challange, but in some areas of the world everyday life does'nt require a personal car. In many cities around the world, personal transport is less than a necessity. Cities have taken action to reduce the green house emitions that cars give out. Many large cities are providing alternet modes of transportation. These alternet modes of transportation can reduce smog over the city and contribute less to co2 emitions.

In a German suburb named Vauban cars are a rare sight. Personal garages and home driveways are not commonly seen. Only 30% of famikies in this suburb own a personl car, everyone else walks or rides a bike as their daily comute. City planners are working on ways to better suite sidewalks for citizens that do not hane cars. Life is said to be ""much better this way"" by people living in this community.

In Bogota Colombia is a program that is expected to spread to other countries. On one day all personal car transport is banned with voilators faccing a $25 fine, this day was proporly named the day without cars. Only taxies and buses are permited vehicle transport, while most people will either walk or ride a bike to work and to complete the days tasks. The goal of the day without cars is to promote alternet forms of transporn and to reduce smog output by the city of 7 million. Many people are welcoming to the idea and are happy to participate in it.

The city of New York is a large and bustiling city, and anyone who has ever been there will tell you of the extreme road congestion. A large amount of people in the city do not own cars and will use public transport to get to their destination. Using the subway, sky rocket or a taxi/bus people are able to move around on their own two feet sometimes faster than a car. In the whole United States the amount of 16-19 year olds getting their license has dropped since 2006. Along with the amount of cars being sold each year. This has made people wonder if the driving peak in America has passed and that more youngsters will resort to public transport like in New York.

Places around the world are now taking action to reduce co2 emitions in the atmosphere. Places like Germany, Bogota Colombia and places in America are now relying on public transport more than before. Bogota Columbia is so dedicated to this idea that they have reserved a day in which nobody drives a car and only walks, rides a bike or takes the bus. In Vauban Germany a suburd has shown that you don't need a personal car to ""survive"" in this world where only efficiency matters. Also in New York people have adapted to walking and using public transport to get to where they need to go. It has been proven that life isn't imposible without a car.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"The senator should keep the Electoral Collage because it keeps balance, order, and also actrecy.

It keeps balance because if the public were to vote on who is the new president of the Untied States some people might fight and argure over who's the new president, why he should be their, and a lot of other reasons. The population might think he will be a great guy and a good president, and that everything will turn out ok. Then when they are elected it turns out he might not be such a great president after all, he's probably going to make all the wrong decides and choices for this nation after a becomes president.

In the Electoral Collage they look at how many votes both of the candidates get, they also look at what the candidates have in mind for our country and all of the other plans they have enstore for it. Of course the public will have to vote on which candidate they want for this nation to serve as our president. After looking at the candidates background, what their going to do, then they will make a discision who becomes president of the Untied States.

The Electoral Collage is a good thing to have around because without it the whole voting process will be out of order. Thanks to the Electoral Collage things will stay in order and in place. And in the end we can find and get the best president for this nation.",1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the world today many products that companies come out with includes innovative technology that enters the homes of millions world wide. It is technology that in the past, was only imagined on tv shows and movie screens. Driveless cars are one of those technologies that has been imagined time and time again but it has yet to actually become a fully functioning reality. Although, it should be and with companies like google and tesla already at the forefornt of this innovation it dosen't seem too far fetched that in a few years

people might just see one of those driveerless cars on the road and It would probaly benefit us as a society.

The idea of a driveless car isn't new

in fact "" In the lat 1950s, general motors created a concept car"" for it. and even though it wasn't really the car that was smarter and more of the roads the idea was still there. The only diffrences between the idea of driverless cars then and now is that the cars weren't nearly as smart as cars now in which many have computers and then they most likely weren't thinking about the idea of climate change which now is a huge consideration. Not only would driverless cars make it easier on the driver, but

it would also make it easier on the enviorment. because the car would most likely need massive amounts of energy they would also most likely be complety electric or a hybrid saving the money of the driver since they aren't spending it on gas and cutting back fuel emmisions.

Many critics of the car would say it is unsafe to have on the road because the computer wouldn't be able to understand the traffic laws however "" Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver"" but If the laws were altered to include driverless cars then the only issue would be faliure of the technology. However, if the cars are designed properly that would most likely be at or below the rate of human error. which means it could prevent major accidents from happening speciffically those occuring due to drunk driving.

There is still a lot of time before driverless cars are realesed and is considered safe to use in america. But the idea of the future where the driver isn't actually required to do anything is excitiing. It will one less inovation that is only imagined and not reality.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"America would be a better place if there were no vehicles. Americans could walk wherever they go, instead of sitting down and riding/driving there. With much extra walking time, we would probably lose a lot of weight and get healthy or healthier than some already are. America has the largest percentage of obese citizens, more than any other country in our world. With the loss of vehicles we could change that.

Not many people realize this, but vehicles and any kind of chair is a lot of the reason why Americans are so obese. We sit down for every thing that we do. We sit in the car, at school, at work, at home, etc. If everyone walked to their destination they would burn calories and fat. Just getting rid of vehicles would make a dramatic change in the amount of obese people. Researchers suggest that obesity is caused mainly by laziness, and vehicles bring that suggestion to life.

All I'm tryin to say is that if we get rid of vehicles then Americans would not be so fat because they would actually have to get up off of their lazy butts and walk to a restaurant or grocery store to go get their food.",1,3,1,2,1,1,1,0,2
"I think that this is a great piece technology for school laptops.

In school kids will get confused about many things that they are learning.

This invention could help students who struggle to understand a lot of content.

Students in high school have a lot of pressure on them in those 4 years.

It can be very hard to keep up with every lesson.

If the technology is able to tell if a student is confused or not and, be able to change the lesson to help it should be implemented in to everyones laptop.

Many students also don't have the nerve to raise their hand and ask a question becuase they think that they will be mad fun of for it.

With this technology a student would is afraid of that won't have to ask a question in front of everyone becuase the technology will know he/she needs help. This can be used for many different reasons also it could tell if a student is sad, and that he/she might need to see guidence.

This would be a great piece of technology for schools to have. This invention would help students get better grades to be able to have a chance to go to college.

Inventions like this are what is helping many people succeed, going outside the box to help others.",1,3,0,2,0,0,1,1,1

"Cars are a huge advantage in traveling. They can get people to places faster than a single horse could; and their a lot safer than riding on a horse. While there are positive advantages to these moble transportations, there are also negative portions that cars have. You may be awfully suprised what these transports can do outside their good nature. For instance, cars run on fossil fuel, which is a artifical gas that ruins the enviorment as much as people cutting down trees and smoke coming out of nuclear plants that do damage to the clouds in the sky. Cars don't just hurt the enviorment, they hurt innocent lives as well. Let me pull out an example: Person A and Person C are driving on the interstate when Person B spills out too much fossil fuel from the exaust pipe of his car. This causes both Person A & C to spin out of control and crash into each other because they couldn't see the road very well because of Person B. This isn't the only threat cars can pull into, but I'll get to that later. With all these bad occurances that happen people have been wondering, ""how can we save both lives and the enviorment from the issues of cars at the same time""? There is a way to do just that: limiting car usage.

Like I said before, cars can have a lot of negative issues in their state of mind. Some examples are foggy weather, over usage of fossil fuel, speeding, texting and driving, drunk driving and many more that exist that I cannot mention. Because of these issues, cities like Vauban Germany, Paris France and Bogota Colombia have banned(well not really banned but you get what i mean) driving cars due to the bad issues cars can/have caused. In the US, the presentage of people driving cars has decreased a lot over the past few years (the story doesn't say what persentage). As much as I hate them doing that, they actually have a reason. In this case of fellow citizens, car usage should be banned for various reasons. I won't be telling all the reasons because that would take a long time to do so.

Reason #1: Drunk driving. Have you ever known someone or heard about an incident were a person is drunk inside a car and crashes into any random source they don't see coming? Well, let us face the facts: drunk people should not drive. If someone is drunk at a bar and is feeling funny, they should either walk home or get someone to pick them up. Drunk people who drive have a great chance at getting someone hurt of themselves hurt because of their stupid attitude. The person shouldn't drive again until they are fully consious again. Reason #2: Extreme weather. When people drive in extreme, they are risking their lives in a greater persentage than a zombie apocolypse, terrorists invading any country and being attacked by people who try to kill you. Extreme weather like thunderstorms, hail and strong fog are too dangerous for people to drive in. If you drive in that type of weather, there is a 90% chance you will not make it out without injuries. People need to wait for the weather to either calm down or stop completely(I just wait until it stops completely so that it wouldn't get worse as it calms down). This will help them prevent them or anyone from getting a wreck. If it occurs randomly while your driving then your screwed. Reason #3: texting and driving. Why is it that most people in this generation keep getting stupid and stupid every single minute? This is one of those incidents that has such that. People who text while driving pay more attention to their stupid phone than focusing on driving. Like drunk driving people who care about texting so much need to either sit in the back and text or not ride in the car at all. They propably should stay away from a car as long as possible until they learn to not text and drive at the same time. You can't do two things at once unless you're some one fictional or a pro at it. Final reason: Expoit of fossil fuels. I don't need to talk much about this one because I already did in my first paragraph and it is related to the extreme weather topic but I will do it once more. Cars that exploit fossil fuels can cause damage to the enviorment. If the smoke is exploited too much it can not only more damage to the enviorment, but it can cause people to reck as well.

These are the reasons that fellow citizens like you should limit your car usages. Remember that cars are not a same transportation vehicle that can get you from point A to Point B, they have a dark side like everything else. Even if you do limit your car usages, it doesn't mean you are safe from the world that hunts you down. Be careful out there and follow the percautions of safty carefully when you are traveling either by car or anyother place.",3,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Humans tend to think of only the present and not the future. We sometimes only focus on immediate comforts and don't think about how are decisions now will affect our kids and grandkids in the future. Yes, cars are amazing right now. They give us a kind of freedom that is unparalled. But at the same time they hurt the enviroment which hurts not just our future but our present also. Imagine not having a car. I can hear all the gasp now but really think about it. Not having to worry about spending half your paycheck on gas. Yes gas prices are down but for how long. Without cars you also won't have to worry about spending hundreds of dollars to fix it up when it breaks down. But best of all, not having a car will definetly have positive effects on your enviroment.

I have lost count on how many times my father has complained and stressed out about gas prices and the amount of money it takes to fix up his car when it breaks down. Admitedly gas prices are down. Lower than they've been in a while. But how long will that last before its back to $3.50 for a gallon of gas. And I am sure you could find something better to do with $400 than spend it fixing a transmission. Whatever that is. Not having a car releases stress. Soccer moms are the last person you would expect to give up there cars but in Vauban, Germany, a car free town that is exactly what heidrun Walter has done. She is a media trainer and a mother of two and she said ""when I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". If she can do it we can do it.

A lot of towns and cities are doing things like car free day. Which is where for that whole day everybody walks or uses their bikes and the only motor vehicles on the road are buses and taxis. In Paris, the smog level was so high, higher than Beinjin, China, that authorities banned the used of car on the roads for a while in an effort to reduce the smog level. People who didn't follow the ban were fined 33 dollars. In Bogota, Columbia though it was more of a choice for the people to give up their cars. ""Millions of Columbians hiked, biked, skated ot took buses to work during a car-free day yesteday, leaving the streets of capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" said Andrew Selsky of the Seattle times. This is a program that is being spread to other contries. The goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Although there was gray clouds let loose rain showers now and then it did not stop the huge amount of participants. After three years two other Colombian cities joined the event. The mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay said ""There people are generating a revolutionary change and this is crossing borders"".",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" describes a new techology called the Facial Action Coding System(FACS for short), this system enables conputers to read facial expressions to identify human emotions. This program can be used in classrooms to find out when a student is bored or confuse, this can help teachers chage their lessons to something that can keep a students active and focased on there studies. As long as the software can only read emotions, read if a student is lying or not and make help make lessons more active, I am for its use in schools.

This program can only read six basic emotions- happiness, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and each are associated with different characteristic movements. The way it reads your emotions is by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles in order for the program to read each emotion. In class this can be used to find confused and bored students and then help the teacher change the lesson so that they can understand it better or become more focased on the lesson. This can help effectively raise grades for students who are prone to becoming confused and bored.

Now this can also be used to figure out if a student or convict is lying or not. Muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Now if someone is fake smiling or keeping a strait face while lying the program can use that to help notify people if someone is lying or not.

The program can help make classes and students, more active and controlled. When knowing if a class is confused or bored can make a big diffence because the lesson or teacher can then be changed to the students likeing so the class can continue on focased and active. Which helps students whom are prone to get distracted.

As long as this program can help students in these ways than schools should invest in this program to keep their students active in their lessons. So then schools wont have to continue constanly be trying new things to figure out how to keep their active and focased.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are less air pollution. Less smog would be intensifying in other countries. more people would be released from the stress of owning a car people wouldnt have to worry about gas prices. The rate of car accidents would go down and so would the percentage of deaths caused by car accidents. more money would be saved since less people wont have to worry about spending any money repairing their vehicles or tuning them up.

Crime rates would decrease since less ppl would be able to commit crimes without a car,and no one could have their car stolen from them. Teen deaths caused by drunk driving would decrease as well. The cost of emissions would go down imensly and the U.S would gain alot more money because of less money spent on vehicles and and imports and gas,oil,tires and other vehicle related cost expenses. Limiting car usage is one of the best possible thing U.S American citizens can do to help preserve our earth and its enviorment.

It is best if everyone start to limit their car usage so that our planet can be less polluted and can be smog free. Cars are one of the biggest reasons for air pollution and we spend alot of money and them aswell. So i believe car usage should be limited for the greater good of our earth.",2,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,0
"In theory a self driving car is a great idea, but in reality it is an accident waiting to happen. Self driving cars have many flaws to them. I beleive the development of these cars should no longer continue.

The self driving cars are never self driving, they still require the passenger to be there when it does not know what to do. The artical says "" The car can read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code."" This means that someone can send a wrong message through a computer, causing an accident. The death rate from car accident could rise with the development of the self driving car. Whith hearing that would you trust your child to be in that car?

People who agree to continue the development of these cars have many of theair own opinions. They say that the sensors on the car help make it safer.

They also might say that its a lot less stressful for the driver. The accepters of this product may also say that all safty measures are taken care of.

There are many things wrong with many of the statements above. The sensors on the car can go bad, how will the person know before its to late? How is a self driving car less stressful for the driver? If anything they would have to pay more attention to the road to make sure the car was working correctly. The safty procations of these vehicals rely on the driver noiticing the car is speakinging to it or that the seat is vibrating. Sometimes people do not feel my phone vibrate in their pocket or hear if for that matter, how are we suppoded to trust a car to alert you if we can not trust our phones.

Through out this campaign to have self driving cars it seems there is no one out there that wants to ask the hard questions, everybody thinks it is a great idea because it is new. Will this product be safe, we dont know, but it doesnt look promissing. In conclusion i do not beleive we should continue the devlopment for self driving cars.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Are you happy the way you vote today, would you be happy if we were to change the way we vote for president. Because they are thinking to change the electroal vote. I think that we should keep the Electoral College because it has been doing us good for a long time, and if we do change it, it would take a while for us to get used to it.

The first reason why it think that we shouldnt change the Electoral College is because it has been doing us good for almost 300 years. Let me ask you a question, do you change or fix something thats not broken,Than why change the Electoral College. We have had fair Elections in the pass and we still do, people vote for who they want as president of the united states, and if they get the better half of the votes than they are president. As we saw in 2012 when ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the Electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him  and Romney....because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all- basis, even a cery slight popularity in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state"" which is in source 3.

The second reason why I think that we should keep the electoral college is because it would take time for us to get used to the new method. Since we vote every 4 years and if we get a new way to vote there will be a few that wont know how to vote the new way and when it comes for it to vote again people will forget how they voted for the president. So if they vote for the person who they actually dont want its not like they can vote again. But as I said earlier its easy to vote with the Electoral College as its a winner takes all. The electoral vote does have a couple flaws that could be changed easily but in all other ways the elctoral vote is the way to go.

And thats why I think that we should keep the electoral College because one it hasd been doing us good and it will take us a while to get used to the new voing system.",2,2,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you ever thought about why there are so many deaths in the world? Most leading deaths are from vehicles and the driver behind the wheel, wether they are texting, talking on the phone, or under the influence. I believe it is a great thing to live in a city where car usage is very limited.

Living in a world where everyone has to walk or ride a bike to go from place to place also means that everyone gets their daily exercise. Today, in society people are usually sitting in a car, others they ride a bike or take a walk. While doing these activities you have to worry about anything hitting you, for this instance a car. What I am trying to say here is less people die as less people drive.

Another reason to limit car usage is weather patterns. You never know what the weather is going to be like, therefore you will never know what you might run into. There have been some cases for pile-ups from smog. smog is a mixture of smoke and fog, making it impossible to see. Diesel fuel doesnt help the case for smog either. The diesel helps the smog by polluting the air around the area.

In Bogota Colombia, a program that is set set to spread to other countries. This program is called ""Car-free day"", millions of Colombians hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this day. This day also brings avoidment to traffic jams. Some citizens say it is a good way to lower air pollution. Less car usage is helping to clean the air. This generation needs to understand that if we want a clean future for ouselves and our families.

President Obama has a goal to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions. Recent studies shows that Americans are buying fewer cars and getting fewer licenses as the years progress. It is said that the number of miles driven in the U.S. peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment research company says ""as of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly nine percent blow the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995"". Some people have cars and the rarely use them, living in big cities where taking a bus or riding a bike would not be necessary if having a car.

Some other things why limiting car usage is a good thing is gas prices, they are so overated now. Gas used to be .97 cent per 9/10 a gallon. Now, you cant find a gas station anywhere without the ranging prices of $2.45-$3.75. That price is ridiculous, who wants to pay $37 for 10 gallions of gas? I sure dont, that is another reason why some people find it easier to ride a bike. They save money! Yes, I understand that the economy is bad. Bad to the point where i do not feel like going anywhere anymore? Things are changing in this world and it needs to continue.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The author for ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,""writes about his studies for Venus and how dangerous it can be. But the author suggests that we should study Venus and its dangers. In this article, it explains how NASA has tried multiple times to visit Venus but the space craft could not handle it. The author makes you feel more encouraged to study this because it wants you to try and discover more features of Venus by having you study more about it.

In the article, the authors uses multiple facts about the dangers of Venus. Such as in paragraph 1,it says, "" It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" It's good for students to really learn how dangerous Venus can really be. Learning how Venus is alike to Earth and how imbearably hot it can be can say a lot about where its title came from. Knowing how temperatures can be up to 300 degrees on Venus can encourage you to study it more by thinking how and why is it like that in Venus.

The tiltle is called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" for a reason. The word challenge is used in paragraph 8,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" The author really imphasises the word dangers in his article. By expressing the dangers of the degrees and how space crafters could not land on Venus. Now learning that people have the desire to try and visit Venus, they will have to study and learn different ws to land depite its dangers. The word, ""Challenge"" encourages people. It makes people want to do it more. By the author putting in the words such as challenging and dangerous, it just makes to readers want to study about it more. Despite how hard it can be.

This article is worthy pursuit despite all dangers because it motivates you to learn more about it. Juat like in paragraph 8 it says,""Should be expanded to meet the very edge of imagination and innovation."" The more people can learn about it, the more scientist can get better information. The dangers details encourage the reader. In paragraph 5, NASA explains the work that they have tried to put in by making a space crafter and landing it on Venus. But that has not been possible in decades.

""The Challenge of Explaing Venus,"" really does its work to encourage the readers the study Venus. It tells about the dangers of it, how scientist have studied it, and how scientist are trying to come up with different space crafters to work on landing on Venus. The author supports this idea by using words to persuade you to learn more about Venus.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. For years and years NASA has been trying to study Venus and despite their pursuits they have failed because of the risks that have occured. Venus should still be studied despite the dangers it presents because one day when Earth becomes overpopulated Venus could possibly be our only option due to how similar the planets are, our travels should go beyond Earth, and although it is dangerous it still needs to be studied.

Years from now Earth will become overpopulated and might be inhapitable; therefore, Venus could be our only option. In the article it says that, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rockky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetay visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" Venus should still be studied due to how similar it is to Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condtions, but survivable for humans.

Our travels must go beyond Earth;although, it has been challenging to study Venus, there will always be risks that come along with studying new things; such as, the planets in our solar system. In the text it states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has no value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. There has been numerous spacecraft sent to land on this cloud-draped world. Although each previous mission was unmanned and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours does not mean that Venus should no longer be studied. Any planet will have their own dangers, causing there to be obsticles in our path of researching a potential, habitable planet.

Studying Venus will come will dangers and risks; but, our planet got this far because the people in it never gave up on pursuing a new study even if it had dangers of it's own. Venus should still be studied because our travels should go beyond earth regardless of the dangers, one day Earth won't be habitable and it's sister planet will be our only option, and new studies will come with their dangers they still need to be studied.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Just think of all of the amazing things you could see and experience being a seagoing cowboy. Everyone should become a sea going cowboy. Theese three reasons are why: Everyone would get to see/ go to amazing places, the seagoing cowboys would get to help people in need that were affected by World War ll, and you would get to help care for the animals on board the boat. This essay will explain why everyone should be a seagoing cowboy.

The first reason that everyone should be a seagoing cowboy is because you will get to see/ experience amazing things and places. In the story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves Luke, the main character, said he went to places like Europe, China, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal! Who would not want to go there?

The second reason everone should become a seagoing cowboy is because the goal of the seagoing cowboys is to help people that have been affected by World War ll. Just think about how much that would mean to the people that the seagoing cowboys are helping and there family. To have lost everything, but the seagoing cowboys helped those people back to a good life.

The third reason everyone should become a sea going cowboy is because they get to take care of the animals. If they need food, someone gives them food. If they need water,someone gives them water. If they get sick or hurt somehow, then someone needs to help get them healed, etc. If the seagoing cowboys are not going to help someone or see something they are on the boat taking care of the animals.

Everyone can/ should become a seagoing cowboy. They should become a sea going cowboy because theese three reasons: they get to see and experience meny amzing places like China, Europe, Greece, Venice, Italy, and the Panama Canal, but those are just a few. They are helping people that were affected by World War ll. They also get to take care of the animals on the boat! Just imagine this life, helping people that were affected by the war, taking care of animals, playing games and experiencing amazing places. What could be better?",2,4,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Have you ever wondered about the Face? The one so talked about, movies and books were made about it? In the late 90's, there was a picture taken of a rather human like landform. But get this

-

it wasn't on Earth! The discussion of whether the landform was alien made or a common Cydonia Martian mesa was huge, and is still fret over today. But lets get real, the possibility of the landform being alien made is surreal - with our advanced technology today, we would know!

About twenty-five years ago, an interesting picture was found with one of NASA's spacecrafts, Viking 1. From the region Cydonia of the 'Red Planet', Viking 1 had taken a picture of a large face that stretched almost two miles wide. The landform became better known as the Face. When the picture was released to public, it was a big deal. Scientists had begun to figure it was just another Martian mesa that just happened to have unusual shadows. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", paragraph two even states this. These shadows caused many people to assume it looked similiar to some kind of Egyptian Pharaoh. The general public, although amazed by the coincedence it had been, couldn't have ignored the sayings of a scientist, especially when all the facts come into play with the logical explanation - not aliens!

Even with the scienctists saying what was undeniably the truth, people demanded proof. Few scientists believed the chance of the Face being put there by exterestrial beings, but getting images became one of NASA's priorities. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take ten times sharper images of the Face. In the paragraph seven, you could find that thousands of people were waiting, waiting for an image that may decide what exactly the Face had been. After the image had been taking, not everybody was happy. This resulted in many suggestions as to why there was no proof of aliens having made the Face. It was winter and hazy. Reading through paragraph eight of the article, you can also find many of the excuses used to try and find proof of aliens exsistence.

With many complaints under their belts, Mars Global Surveyor went for another go. This time on a cloudless summer day. On Apri 8, 2001, they were sent in for another look at the Face. The images, taken again, did not show any proof of aliens. To many conspiracy lovers dismay, the images were rather like Earth Landforms. Instead of alien markings, they found that the Face is equivalent to butte or mesa. Even common to landforms in the American West. In paragraphs ten, eleven, and twelve, you can read through the precautions taken to find even clearer images of the Face, though nothing had changed. Without any other evidence to go off of, what could the theorists say?

Others, such as conspiracy theorists, say that NASA has found evidence of the other life forms. They may be right, stating things such as this. But they also say that NASA is withholding this information. While that may be a good idea for other people, NASA's budget says otherwise. With the information of alien exsistence out, their funds could go up a rather lot. Would it be a good idea to hold this information to the public? Especially when it will not only be informing the people, but also helping NASA discover more about our universe.

As stated the possibility of us not coming across alien lifeforms with todays technology is unlikely. With all the precautions they took to prove (or in this cause, disprove) alien exsistence, it is highly unprobable that we missed them. With the scientist, looking over the images twice, and then checking them, the answer is in lockdown. And even if we were, sharing the information is in almost everyone's best interest. If it had been aliens, we surely would have known, wouldn't we? Unless, of course, the aliens could were invisible. How about you tell THAT to the conspiracy theorist?",4,4,3,4,1,2,3,3,3
"A spacecraft was launched into outter space. Outerspace consists of many planets, including Mars. On the planet Mars, scientists have a discovered a face. The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

People say the Face was crafted by aliens. Because it was winter, the camera in the spacecraft had to look through clouds to see the Face. Due to the weather conditions, some people say that ""alien markings"" were hidden by fog.

Many details support that the Face on Mars is a natural landoform. Jim Garvin, a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, states that if ""alien markings"" existed on Mars, they would have been discovered because the image of the Face was enlarged 3 times the pixel size. Also, the Face resembles a butte or mesa, common landforms around American West. In fact, Garvin also says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This is an ""isolated mesa"" that is almost the same height as the Face.

Proven with facts, the Face on Mars is just a natural landorm. Outerspace has many wonderful discoveries. With proper research and equipment,

Those discoveries can be made just like the Face.",1,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,3
"I don't like the idea of driveless cars. I feel like if a human can do it we should. Especially when it comes to things like that. like the idea of robots, would you really want something cleaning for you and taking care of older folks and children. I do think they are a good idea for the blind and people not going to far. Like since i live in Indiana, they would be a good idea for people in Indianapolis to get from the mall to like a resturant or something. Nothing major or far like driving from Indiana to California, not a good idea. I just don't trust things like that.

Driveless cars are sort of a good idea. they're are many pros and cons about the whole thing. I feel like they are dangerous because they could malfuncting and blow up or something. Or they will drive right into a buliding at full speed or something. No car is really safe in general, but letting a robot like thing drive your car is kinda a crazy idea. Another con is that they can't really drive by itself, it still needs you to hold the steering wheel and take control when around accident ot people working on roads. I feel like if they want to have driving cars they should just bulid a car that can drive people instead of a car that half does it. Another con is that they are basically illlegal in most states except a couple. Would we have to visit somewhere else to expericence what crazy technology the world has for us now. I also think they are a bad idea because driving are probably going to be directly on their phone, no hand on the steering wheel or anything. And like it says, when the car needs you to take over it will tell you to take over. But i feel like people will just ignore it and get into accidents they could have prevented.

Pros are that you can half drive. You wouldn't have to really pay attention to anything around you and you could just relax while driving.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Dear Mr. Senator,

Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished because Americans have the right to have full control over who is elected President and, although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods.

Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government. According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions?

Unquestionably, the Electoral College is not a sound system for presidential election in the United States. In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. This statement appears as a faulty reasoning to have an Electoral College because it is obsurd to remove Americans' right to vote. Maybe, rather than restricting our rights, the result of a run-off election could be resolved by an Electoral College, but the initial vote should be made only by the citizens, fairly. Depending on the defenders to make the final decision of the leaders of our great country is an overly-cautious effort to avoid a tie, which could be easily resolved.

You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. Thank you.

Sincerely,

John Doe",3,4,2,3,1,1,3,2,2
"Alien's have been a question many astronauts and people from all around the world have been wondering about for ages. But do they actually exsit? A few years ago NASA discovered what seemed to look like a face on Mar's surface. Many think that the so called ""Face"" was created by alien's. But others think it was just created by natural causes just like how some landforms are created on Earth. How do you think that the formation was created?

So far NASA hasn't discovered any alien markings or any other form of life on other planets. This is one of the reasons why the formation was created by natural causes and not by alien's. Just like on Earth we discover something new every day, such as new landforms and new natural resources. The formation couldn't of been formed by alien's because where did they get the tools to make it? If aliens exsited, i think we would have more evidence.

Alien's don't exsit becuase we would have found some evidence of diffrent life on diffrent planet's by now. If their are no aliens then their are no alien made objects on Mars. Alien's probably would have found a better communication rought then sending us weird landforms that dont have much meaning at all.

Why of all things would the aliens create a face? Even if aliens did exsit i don't think it is their goal in their life to scare us humans. They would probably make something more reasonable, like a house or something like a shelter.

Along with the formation there are also many landforms on earth that are similar. Such as the Grand Cannon and things like that. Think if the humans lived on Mars and we came to Earth and saw the Grand Cannon we would automatically think that there must be life here since there is no other way this could have been formed. Just as we believe there is life on Mars we would assume their is life here. Untill their is more evidence about alien's we should not believe that they exsit.

As it says in the artical ""What the picture actually shows is the Maritian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" This landform represents many of the already discovered landforms on earth such as the Grand Cannon and their is no official evidence that aliens exsit this is obviously a naturally formed landform and not created by aliens.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,2,0
"The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.

The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.

Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.",1,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"A lot of people have diffrent out looks on driverless cars. I on the other hand think it is stupid, and pointless. With these cars we are putting other peoples lives at risk. They have so many sensors on them! What if these sensors stop working? These cars will cause a lot of traffic problems such as crash's, breaking when you don't need too, just little stupid stuff like that! So, before buying one of these ""driverless"" cars I would advise you to read about it first.

I am against ""driverless"" cars for many reasons, one with being that it would cause a lot of wrecks. You will never ever know when the car might not want to stop or when the car might not want to turn the way you want it. Put it this way, these cars are the most dangerous thing they could ever come out with. The cities want to stop street wrecks. Well, by bringing ""driverless"" cars it is not going to help at all. This car is not safe at all. It states in the passage that ""Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" Which this is basically saying that it's not even legal yet!

Two being that you never know when the car is going to lose control. It states that ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger to backing into an object."" For instence say you're in this ""driverless"" car, and you are going down a bump street, you won't be able to feel when the seat vibrates because it'll be so bumpy. With that being said that can make you lose control and crach the car. Now, what if this happend to happen and you have an infant in the car, your risking not only your life but the passangers/the infant in that car!

Three with being that the car has sensors.

It stated that "" For starters they needed a whole lot of sensors."" So, they needed sensors to recognize where they are at. They use these sensors for everything. It's all computrized. What if the computer stops working? This just basically means that these sensors are liable to stop working. These sensors are liabile to catch on fire. Last but not least what if you have a horrible person running the computers, and instead of sensing someone to where they needed to go he/she sensored them to a dark alley. The driver would be in trouble and theres nothing no one could do about it because their would be no proof. You guys are putting your lives at great risk!

Your putting your perfect life at risk! These cars are not and should not ever be legal. The majority of the people that would even buy this car would probably be the lazy people. You guys may think this car is amazing, but really it is not. This is beyond dangerous. Think before you act/buy. Before even buying a car like this i'd advise you to read about it first. Read all the pro's and con's! Good Luck.",2,4,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I would not suguest self-driving cars. What if war ever comes and the enemy were to somehow hack the cars and kill people who are in them. Everyone would require a car upgrade and some people wont be able to afford that. Im good with a 2005 Monte Carlo. Now what they should do is bring classic cars back and start making parts for them again.

In my honest oppinion I believe 1969 was the golden years for cars. I wouldn't want a car that has a camera that watches me while I drive. Thats like too far over the line. I can understand if they made flying cars in the future that uses magnetic power or even fuel of some sort. I honestly believe that we are going to keep creating better and better technology.

Eventually technology is going to be smarter than humanity and it will over run the human race and make us the lowest life force. People need to think for future preferences. Driveless cars would also be a bad idea because some older people don't get technology too well and they could get seriously hurt if they don't opperate the car right. Some people wouldn't want to have a camera in a car that watches them because they may go park somewhere and want to do something private and it wouldn't be private with a camera above their head. Plus people would start to get lazy and not want to drive at all.

Then we may have another obeasity problem. There are just too many concerns and unanswered questions to have self driving cars. I trust a human driver a lot more than an electrical driver any day. I wouldn't want to drive a car thats smarter than me. Theres no telling what could happen with these cars.

Yes they may have been tested and everything but the outcome may vary with different cars. If you ever did wreck I could just imagine how much it would cost to do all of the repairs. Thats why I wouldn't suguest driveless cars.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,1
"Many people, and car companies, are beginning to come up with the idea of driverless cars. Driverless cars have always been an idea to people but never a reality, they have been featured in many things, such as movies and books, companies are now trying to make this idea an actual reality in our lifetime. There are many pros and cons to driverless cars, but we have to think will this be an advantage or disadvantage to our society?

My opinion on driverless cars is on both sides, I see many advantages and disadvantages, such as; driverless cars are said to cut the use of fuel by half which would be great for our planet, but also it could be very dangerous because we all know that if we have driverless cars we will have people who use the cars as excuses or reasons to do things that are not considered lawful today without driverless cars.

People who may be for the driverless cars may not be wanting the driverless cars for good reasons, they may think that because they are not in total control of the car at all times that gives them the excuse of they are not one hundred percent reasonsable for anything bad that may happen while they are in the car. They may think that they can get away with many more things because they are not driving the whole time, they could get away with texting and driving, or even being under the influence while driving. Yes, these cars will give them signals for when they need to drive but who knows if they will actually pay attention to the signal. If people today do not think anything of the laws we have set in our country what makes us think that just because they are not driving that it is any safer?

People who are for the car for good reasons are thinking about how much driverless cars could help our world. Driverless cars cut the amount of fuel used in half, that would help not only our economy but our ecosystem. These driverless cars are said to decrease the amount of wrecks happening everyday, they will have automatic brakes, these cars would basically be able to tell when we are in danger. All of the sensors on these cars could maybe even take sensors into homes and stores that could make our world so much safer.

If you were not able to tell I think I may be against the development of driverless cars, in my opinion I think there are many more things that could go wrong with the car than things that could go right. People may not take the idea of these cars seriously, but we need to realize that these cars may become an actual reality and there is nothing that we can do about it but accept it and become aware of the things that we should be doing rather than the things we could do with driverless cars.",3,2,0,1,0,1,1,1,1

"In this prompt I will be writing an argumentive essay about comparing the two ideas from the story i read ''Un masking the face on mars"". The two two sides of this argument is wether the face isthink it is alien remains or natural landform. I personly think it is just an natural landform.

Why i think it is a natural landform is because there is no other sins of life so if there was aliens on mars why would they left a big face carved on a rick insted of something more alien like. Also like Garvin said the face also is very simular to a butte or mesa and the hase details are probly just weird shaperd errosion patterns that over time have come to look like the modern human face.

The face could also posibley be an alien artifact for more specsece to find. Much resuch has been done on mars to see if other human life is on it due to its closeness to the goldy locks zone withc is a obital zone that human life could potetionly live in like earth for example. The NASA teams have even found frozen water on Mars and that is one of the basic needs for animals considering we are over 70 percent water.

It is much more likly the face is just a natural land form though because of how much the size and shape resemple a butte or mesa from the mid west. Plus they're is more then one formation lik this this happens to be the only one is the shape of a htman face. You also have to consider they're is many natural formations who look like other thingd on earth.

In conclution It is a likly chance that the face is nothing more or less then a natural land form who happens to look like the modern humsn face, but we should not dought becuase no one knows for certain.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In the article the author greatly supports the idea of studying Venus and that it will be worthy despite the dangers. In paragraph 8 the author says that striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. Another example is that in paragragh 4 it says that astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most-earth like planet in our solar system. There are also many dangers that come when visiting Venus and they are that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Something that is even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. One example is using old technology called mechanical computers.

"In my opinion, I do not think that the electoral college should be abolished, but I do agree with some of the points that Mr. Plumer claimed. Mr. Plumer stated, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" While it is somewhat unfair and outdated, the electoral college is needed in a sense of today's society. Everytime someone who is African American is murdered or killed, people always think it's a racial matter. Take a look at the incidents that were going on in Ferguson. Michael Brown, an African American teenager, was shot and killed by an officer, who was a white man. The people of Ferguson were literally rioting in the streets over a matter of a cop defending himself. So if that kind of society were to directly vote for our next president, it would be extremely biased. If another African American were to run for president of the United States, most Blacks would vote for him and say things like, ""If he doesn't win presidency, then this country is racist!"" To me, that's how American society is and that's why we should keep the electoral college.

In addition, the electoral college is needed to keep balance and fairness among the country. If there was no electoral college, and the votes came straight from the people, there would be problems regarding the states and the population of those states. For example, California would have a huge advantage at deciding who the next president is over a small state like Maryland. The electoral college is meant to keep balance among most, if not all, the states.

Another reason to keep the electoral college is that it requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, according to Mr. Posner. He states, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If there was no electoral college, the votes would heavily swing one way or the other, because of regional culture. People in the South would generally vote for someone who is white and Republican, where as the North, or states like Florida and California would vote for someone who is democratic, and since race is a exponentially large matter in today's society, people who are African American would vote for the runnning candidate who is African American or of black descent.

A vote straight from the people could work if racial perspective wasn't a huge factor like it has been since the civil rights movement. But right now, this country needs an electoral college because without one, votes would be based on race, state size, and culture.",2,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,3
"It seems that technology gets upgraded yearly. Recently, Apple has created a software called Animoji. This software allows you to have an emoji replicate your facial actions. This ties into the new software, the Facial Action Coding System. This software analyzes your face and can tell you how much percent happiness, anger, sadness, fear, suprise, or even disgusted you are displaying. Since we already have facial recognition, why not have the software to tell you your mood. This software would benefit education and provide a safer area for students through recognizing extreme signs of depression or anger.

Our mood can either help or damage our learning processes in school. If you are in a bad mood, you will not care as much as you would if you were happy. This software would be very benificial for any classroom. Having this software could help students learn. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huand predicts. Then, the software could modify the lesson to suite the students need. This software could boost the students grades, because the students would be more focused or not get confused due to the Facial Action Coding System. Not only will the software boost the students education, it could also help the school identify if someone is extremely depressed or angry. This software could prevent anything drastic from occurring. It could prevent suicide, shootings, fights and all sorts of things. It could save someones life, if not many peoples lives.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System can benefit our education and learning processes in numerous ways. It can recognize when a student is confused, and then it could modify the lesson to help the student understand the topic. It could also recognize when a student is bored, and then modify the lesson to be more interesting. It could improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely depressed. It could also improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely angry. The shool could then help the students who are depressed or angry to prevent anything drastic from happening.

"Dear Mr. President,

As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents. The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?

Bradford Plumer, author of

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the Best-laid Defenses of System are Wrong, explains how the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country.

The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost.

Now most people are afraid of change, which is understandable. They are afraid chaos will occur if any change with our society's ethics. However, the Electoral College has already caused chaos between the two opposing sides. If we tried a new system, we could see if the people will become more civilized because they now have a say in the government. If it doesn't work, then we can always change it back and no harm will be done. As you can see, there are many possibilities and options we have yet to explore.

Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing.

"Dear Senator,

People have different opinions on the Electoral College. Some feel that it should be changed, and the president should be elected by popular vote. To explain what the Electoral College is, the Office of the Federal Register writes

What is the Electoral College?.

Bradford Plumer writes

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, to explain the problems with the Electoral College, and lastly, Richard A. Posner writes

In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President to explain why we should keep the Electoral College. It has been made clear that we should not change the Electoral College.

It is true that the Electoral College may be confusing (Plumer), but it has worked for all these years, thus we should just leave it the way it is.

To start, The Electoral College was established by the founding fathers as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress, and it also considers the popular vote of qualified citizens (Office of the Federal Register). The founding fathers wanted us to use this system. They knew it would succeed.

Next, Plumer writes, ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair..."" This is not true because the number of electorals each state gets is always decided by the number of members that state has in the House of Representatives, plus two for the senators (Office of the Federal Register).

Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. Plumer goes against that and writes, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This cannot happen.  Posner also writes that ""The electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal."" The north, for example, does not have enough electoral votes to elect a president (Posner). The president is everyone's president.

Also, The Electoral College considers swing states and big states. Plumer writes ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"". This is not true because of the idea of swing states and big states.  Swing States, also known as toss-up states, are the states that pretty much decide the election. They could go either way (Posner). ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senete decreed in the Constitution. "" This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs.

Lastly, by using the Electoral College, we are avoiding Run-Off Elections. A run off election is when no candidate recieves a majority (Posner).

In conclusion, you and I both know the Electoral College has some flaws, but overall, it makes sense to keep it the way it is.

Yours truly,

Emily.",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,0,1
"The development of driverless cars will be a beneficial aspect on the world as it progresses in the future. The development of these cars will ensure the safety of the driver/passenger and outside pedestrians and drivers. this development in cars will also make driving less straining for the driver as it requires careful attention when on the road. Therefore, the development of driverless cars can be supported as a beneficial aspect to revolutionize the world.

When it comes to safety and accidents, cars tend to be always involve those factors. Many daily drivers make the road a more dangerous place because they dont have there full atttention on the road. instead, are distracted by other factors such as texting, or anything thats causes them to take their eyes off the road. with the development of driverless cars, they can ensure the guaranteed saftey of the driver as they will be completeley imobolized to hazardous mistakes. according to the article ""The Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author states that ""most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers"". In this case, it shows that safety is only ensured when drivers are alert. because not all drivers are alert in the real world, saftey can't be guaranteed. This safety can be guaranteed to driverless cars which prime function is to transport; incapable of submission to outside forces.

Driving as previously stated requires plentiful attention to the road and your surroundings. this however, can be straining to the driver due to being restrained to look at the road for a long peiod of time and hands becoming sore from grasping the steering wheel. Driverless cars can relieve the burden of that due to them having control of driving themselves. the driver can instead relax, enetertain himself, and or sleep if exhausted from a busy day. In the article, the author states that enetrtainment/ information systems can be turned off when the driver needs to take over, implying that the driver only needs to be engaged when necessary rather than 100% of the time.

In conclusion, the development of driverless cars can be seen as a great innovation to the safety of the world and drivers among it . People will no longer need to feel the heavy burden of ensuring to remain alert when not fully engaged, or the tense suffering of driving over a period of time. The development of driverless cars will indeed be a positive aspect on drivers global.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Transportation will only advance throughout time. Today's so ciety has advanced from horse and buggy, to steam powered engines, to trains powered by a magnetic field. Cars have advanced from a gasoline powered engine, to an engine that can be charged up from an outlet. The next thing to do is to make transportation easier for the public by making it unnecessairy for them to do much work. The way to achieve this is to mass produce driverless cars.

Driverless cars are very efficent. They don't cause the driver to have to waste time doing the work. Now, the drivers can make phone calls or eat lunch safer than ever. Driverless cars will still require the driver to be aware of its surroundings and be alert for a problem to occur. This causes maximim amounts of safety for the driver, and others on the road. The car is designed to notify the driver if there are any difficulties. Today's society is already halfway to driverless cars, so why not take that extra step? It couldn't do harm, besides many lawsuits, but those could be prevented by making laws for these cars before they're made for the public.

Driverless cars could be very beneficial to society. It could cause so many improvements for other things to technologically advance, too. The work and studies are continuously being made for driverless cars. All transportation could be just as high-tech as driverless cars only if they are released to the public.",2,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"I am against delevopling these driverless cars. I believe that they are inferior to manual driving.I believe that it wouldnt be safe. If one company uses the technology and mass produces these cars. As everyone believes the hype they buy the car, then it malfunctions and causes many crashes then many people wont believe in the selfless driver car after that. also we would have to spend money on making better roads everywhere so the can funtion the same everywhere. Then what if the driverless car cant react to a human driver in a situation. Then machine must be really advanced to recogize the drivers actions and then react.it wouldnt be abled to. Also could it react to drunk drivers? or any reckless drivers?

All in all i dont see driverless cars as being great. I see too many problems,and

risks for this to work. Maybe it would be when we are more sure have better technology.",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"I disagree with this use of technology beacause i think we are relying too much on tech. Today we use so much technology that we are taking a test on a computer that used to be on paper! I worry that if we were to have a nationwide powersurge we'd be sitting ducks. but a couple decades earlier I think we could have been alright. When you are talking with someone you shouldn't rely on tech to tell you how they're feeling, personally I think it's inhumane. I should be able to look at someone and by they're expression (which the computer reads) I myself alone should be able to tell what they are feeling, and if not then you can ask them with your words like a human being would. We aren't robots we don't need to ask siri how are loved ones are feeling. It completely takes away the joys of bonding and in the case of mona lisa, the elegance of mystery. I personally love art and portraits because it's fun to try and figure out what they are thinking and then ask someone else what they think because that person might have a different idea. Using technology would take away peoples idea to different veiw points of the same portrait. I think we should rely on ourselves to figure out what mona lisa is thinking. Personally to me, she looks like a caring guardian kind of woman, maybe a mother or loved one. Going back the text says she was 83% happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, and 2%angry. I say it's 100% up to you. In the case of the students what if the picture is taken when they blink? Or if they sneeze? Jane could be having a really sad day and the picture could be taken at the worng moment and say she was ecstatic. You can rely on tech for these readings you need to read them face to face. Ask them how they are feeling, don't just run up and snap a pic. In conclusion, use your words and ask how someone is feeling!",3,3,3,3,1,2,1,3,2
"There are many differant reasons why you should participate in being a seagoing cowboy. These reasons are the following: you are helping people, you are helping their country, and you are helping spread peace.

The first reason that you should consider being a seagoing cowboy is that you are helping other people. You are helping them by bringing them cattle or other farm animals. By delivering farm animals to them you are helping them by giving them a food source. The people you help can eat eggs from chickens or drink milk from cows or even just kill the animals for food. Sometimes you might even just be delivering someone their pet that they shipped to safety therefore reunighting those people with their beloved pets. People can also use wool from sheep to make clothes or rope. That is how you are helping people.

The second reason is that you are helping those people's country. You are doing this by helping their economy. By delivering farm animals to them you are not only giving those people food and materials for themselves but, those people can sell them. By selling food, drinks, and materials or clothes those people are helping their economy and elderly people who cannot care for such animals. They wouldn't of been able to help their economy is they didn't have the animals to produce goods. That is how you are helping their country.

The third and final reason why you should be a seagoing cowboy is because you are spreading world peace. You are spreading world peace by giving another country something they need. If you help a country and its people they are going to take that as an example. They might help another country. Then, that country will help another and it will just keep on going like that. That is how you are spreading world peace.

That is why you should become a seagoing cowboy. You will not only help the countries in need but, also you will be helping their people and maybe even the world.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I agree with the author wanting to explore more Venus. Venus is often referred as Earth's ""twin,"" and its the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. If a spacecraft landed and survived for more than a several hours we might get enough informtion to answer that question almost every scientists asks ""can there be life on another planet."" Even though Venus being almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet. Even though Venus has a horrible environment astronomers are fascinated by it, because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus still having like Earth features like, it having a rocky sufrace acting like valleys, mountains, and craters. Futhermore, Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. It's a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) came up with an idea of humans being able to study Venus in a safe way. Scientists being able to hover over the planet, but that can go so far in giving us information about the planet. The good thing about that is that it's survivable for humans in the ""not so easy conditions"" of Venus. The curiosity of humans will most likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on earth and beyond shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

These are some of the reasons to back up why I agree with the author wanting to explore more Venus.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0

"I think having the Facial Action Coding System would be great technology to have in schools. In pragraph 3 it states "" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust,fear, and sadness"" (D'Alto, 3). If you mix these emotions together you can see all the mixed emotions a person can have and fee and not just a basic emotion. Someone could have a mixture of happiness and disgust at the same time and the system would have recognized the emotions the person was feeling.

This technology would be really effective to have when students are testing or doing a lesson. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."" Then it could modify the lessons, like an effective human instructor. (D'Alto 6)"". This claim that the author made really put things more into prespective on how this new technology would be a great idea to have in schools. Not only would this type of technology help the students but it would also help the teachers. If the student looks confused and the computer recognized this, the teacher can then figure out other ways help the student with the lesson and have a better understanding. The computer can also modify the lesson for the student, so they don't struggle as much while doing the lesson the teacher had asked them to do.

""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. (D'Alto 8)."" This could also help when students are lying. Some students don't want to get in trouble so what they then would do is lie. This would help when the teacher thinks the student isn't being 100% truthful or honest. I also think that this would be very useful in other places and not just schools. This technology can be used when anyone in general isn't being fully honest and can help in any situation.

In conclusion, I think this would benifit a lot of schools and a lot of other places. This technology can help many students on homework and the teachers with any troubles they might run into while teaching a lesson and help students have a better understanding with what they are learning.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Making Mona Lisa Smile

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human motions. How people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions. In the smile of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"".

People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile.

In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"".

The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good.

In conclusion the author describes a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System"". Because the technology help to know the emotional expressions to students. The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, Face is just a natural landform because even if it was created by alians there should be some type of building or something some where a round the Face like a building. Think about it. Do you really think that some alian is going to build something like that and leave it there? There is so much things we don't know about Mars, but aliens are not real. According to the text,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

Second, when we took a picture of the Face in 1976. It was because of the weather that it looked like a face. Another reason is because of the angle that we took a picture in. It might also have been the camera. Because of the angle that in took the picture in, the shadow of the mountains made it look like a face. According to the text,""The caotion noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth.""

Next, in 1998, we decided to take another picture of the Face. The tecnology became better and so we got a better view of the Face. It does't look as much like the face we took a picture of in 1976. This time it looked more like a crater. It wasn't a face after all.

Then, in 2001, we took another picture because it was so popular. According to the author,""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" You might think that aliens are real. According to the text,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" We have been searching Mars for a while now and if there was any life form on Mars we would have found it already.

Finally, Face is just another natural land form. According to the author,""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" So it wasn't created by any living thing. It was created by nature. Face is just another natural landform on Mars.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,1
"Dear state senator with all do respect I feel like electoral college is unfair. Why you may ask? because in reality us the U.S citizens aren't getting to actually vote directly for who we want. for example in paragraph 10 in the second source it is stated that the way that college electoral voting works is by letteing the people vote for representatives that represent the actual candidate. In other words lets say that more than 100 people vote for a certain candidate well those 100 peoples vote will not all be counted because that particular candidate may only have 37 representatives.

in addition that makes our votes less valuable! The voting method should actually change to popular vote, because that way it is equal or even and no one is being left out and every persons vote counts. Also the popular vote for president of the U.S is better because in that case there is more possibilities of candidates to last either longer or even have a better opportunity in being elected as president.

The whole point of having popular vote is so that us the citizens feel equal and also free because this is a free state and the whole meaning of this nation was that we the citizens get to pick our president. Another thing why I feel like popular vote is more better is because it would make the governments job so much easier. For example all they would have to do is collect votes and see who has the most. Instead of having to know that the votings are unfair with college electoral voting..

These were my reasons why I feel like popular voting for a president is a much more better choice than college electoral voting.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0

"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process of selecting electors to vote for the president. The Electoral College has both its pros and cons, many reasons for it to stay or be abolished. However, it has more reason to stay rather than changing to election by popular vote for the President.  The wnning canidate for U.S President should be who's the best rather rather than who's more popular. The Electoral College may not be the most democratic method but, it does create a sense of balance. The Electoral College has equal tran-regional appeal, and garuntees an outcome. Therfore, the Electoral College should not be abolished.

The Electoral College garuntees an outcome. With popular voting and a tie could occur. As, Souce 3; ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised methaod of choosing the President"" informs ""The reason is that the winning canidate's share of the Electoral College invariable exceeds his share of the popular vote.""(18). So the losing canidate could argue that winner isn't who the people want however, it's the political party members who chose the electors. In, Source 1; ""What is the Electoral College?"", it states that ""Each canidate ruinning for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the canidate's political party..."" Therefore, there is no mystery or deciet, each party knows their electors and canidates so the people are the ones who indirectly chose the winner. As a result, the Electoral College promises an undebatabe outcome.

Also,the Electoral College doesn't have any prejudice based on region or location. ""The Electoral College requires to have a trans-regional appeal."" (sorce 3).  Therefore, a canidate has to campiaign in all regions, withought just focusing on just one. So every region has an equal oppurtunity and knowledge to be able to vote. Also this way there's a less chance of ""The residents of other reions to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interest, that he really isn't their president.""(19). That feeling of equality and ""my opinion matters"" is exactly what America is about and this aspect of the Electoral College captures that beautifully.

In conclusion, the Electoral college may not be the most democratic way of voting however, it is quite fair.  If we only had popular voting canidates would possible just focuse on one are to build a strong support base. This would'nt give every region or person a fair chance and strong word, which is against everything America stands for. Equality is one of the major virtues of America and the Electoral College expresses equality through balance more so than popular vote. The Electoral College garuntees a certaint outcome without debates or tie breakers. It allows every region to have a fair chance in the election by making sure they are well informed and included through the recquirment of trans-regional appeal. For these reasons the Electoral College should not be abolished and changed to popular vote for United States of America.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Have you ever thought it was a good idea to have driverless cars in the world? I think there are positive and negative things about this; but I agree more on the positive side of things. How would you feel to relax while you're on the road? How would you feel if it was finally legal to be on your phone while you're in the drivers' seat of the car?

I think it is a brillant idea of having driverless cars. Like i said you could relax while on the road. You could be on the phone while in the car. I also think this would be a great idea for people whos job is to make deliveries, such as UPS and FedEx drivers. This also would be a great idea for people who travel a lot and people who travel far distances.

I think more states and car companies should be more open about this idea. They should be open to this idea because all the good things that can come out of it, especially an idea that already has a prototype. More states should allow Google to test their driverless cars. Also lawmakers have to be open about this idea because this could possibly be our future.

Other companies such as BMW, Nissan, Tesla, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz should team up or have a meeting, and create the first ever street legal driverless car. All of those companies have great cars. Also all of those companies have something unique about their cars. So if they all work together, I know they could create a safe driverless car. Then, if they prove to lawmakers that driverless cars could go ""half a million miles without crashing"" maybe lawmakers might make it legal; and maybe more states would be open to having them.

So what do you think about the safety of driverless cars? Do you think driverless cars are too risky or dangerous? Do you think that lawmakers need to make driverless cars legal? Do you think those certain states are over thinking what could be the future? I think driverless cars would be a great idea. Hopefully in the future we could come to an agreement about driverless cars.",1,4,0,3,1,1,1,2,2
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. By reducing the usage of cars we can lower the air pollution in our cities. If the number of cars on the road is lower than usual, then the number of traffic jams and car crashes will be decreased. Driving is a huge responsibility and worrying about protecting your life, the passengers in your cars life, and other drivers on the road's life can be very stressful at times.  Lowering the usage of cars can limit that stress.

Polloution is bad and it destroys the Earth. When we drive, our tailpipes give off greenhouse emmissions that ravage the o-zone layer of our atmoshphere. After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. The congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. By reducing our car usage, we can make our world a more clean and less polluted place.

Traffic jams are annoying and frustrating. Car crashes are dangers and life altering. You can avoide both of these terrible things by limiting how often you drive your car. Everytime you sit down in that drivers seat and turn the car on, there is a chance of getting stuck in traffic or into a wreck. There is no better way to avoid this than walking, taking a bus, or biking where ever you need to go. In a program that was set to spread to other countries, millions of columbians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogota, Colombia free of traffic jams.

Driving can put a tremendous amount of stress on a person. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza. You don't have to live with all of that stress. Just limit yout car usage and you will live a happier life.

In conclusion, there are so many advantages to limiting car usage. You can lower air pollution. Driving less reduces the chances of you getting in a traffic jam or worse, a car accident. Last but most certainly not least, driving less reduces stress.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"We will be talking about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. And how it even got its name. It has another name for it called evening star. i heared that it's really dangerous though. Im about to give you some every important information you need to know w\about Venus/Evening Star.

The detailes that author gives you is incredible he tells you everything you need to know. The evidence is information like its referred to as Earth's twin. Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms density an size. Venus is out of a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets.

NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He tells you everything you need to know about Venus. There devices they use were first envisioned in the 1800s. it sounds shocking but its true. If I was you if you want to learn more about it get into deeper articles about it.

The conclusion on this article is that Venus it a plant that should be study on or even looked at. Because you never know what you could find on that plant.

Although I agree even more when he says that is presents danger.

There are pros and cons on working with Venus. I agree with him because if him and his scientest discover things dealing with the phisical in venus or just plane facts it could do well for them.

Yet, the cons are extreme. In paragraph 2 it states "" No space craft survived the landing after a few hours."" The space men are going to have to learn new techniques in order to discover and survive.

"Some people say the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable and some say it's not valuable. If would to ask me I would say the system is valuable in many ways and them ways can be very helpful in paticular situations. For example, the classroom computer can tell how you feeling by looking at your face, can recognize when a student become confused or bored in a classroom, and they can also indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. For teachers this system can become 10 times helpful, but what really stand out it me right now it can recognize when a student become confused or in a classroom.

This stands out to me because this can helpful or easier to read when a student is student is struggling. 80% of students in a classroom don't usually don't ask for help because they afraid of saying some wrong in front of the whole classroom. Which instead of raising hand the teacher can go straight to the student and have a one on one converstation to make the student feel comfortable. Plus, not only it can see if you confused, it can also tell when you bored. It was said "" the system can see this by looking at your facial expressions or your muscles in your face."" So if a student get bored in class usually intend to go to sleep.

A teacher can look at the system without saying a word and change up the lesson a bit more fun because if you would to ask me paying attention in class is the key to success. Then lets not for get about the other example, "" the system can tell how a friend feeling by looking at their face.""

Some people say this is not a very big deal, but it's really is because one thing a teacher want to do is to get know it's class. When a sees some bad emotions in the system the teacher can reach out and the student in a personal situation. Also give the student space or can be cuation because the student can go off at any second and cause a major classroom disruption. Plus, this can help with team activities and create special bonds because in the text it stated empathy may happen because we unconsciuly imitate another person's feelings"" ,which can be helpful to friends. So if you believe this is fake then you should really read this next section.

In the text it stated "" they even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile."" When it's usally false smile it was said the mouth is stretched side ways in paragraph 8. Also it can read the muscle in your face to tell something is real or not,which help people understand one another better. ""Then in the text it mentioned these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" So can help teachers or students solve situations more quicker and easier in a classroom. Some people disagree though.

People disagree because they nothing can understand a person a feeling. A human with the same emotions can't even understand the next people feelings, what make you think a system or technology can do it. There many apps on phones or computers that be telling straight lies. Systems always catches viruses and always starts to act up it can be giving wrong information. Now you in somebody personal business and make them very angry. In the text it said "" most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convoys happy."" So a machine can't do it either, but in my personal opinion it can help.

The Facial Action Coding Machine can help with telling when a friend is happy or not. Also it can help when to tell a student feel bored or confused. Lastly, it can tell when a student is using fake facial expressions. With these the classrooms of this world can become very more complex. Plus, lets not for get about the updates so this technology can improve more years to come and have more special abilities.

"Although, many people may think that going to Venus despite the dangers is not a good idea going to venus can also be benitfical with new safety measures, and technolgy.

One reason is, Venus is a sister planet to Earth but we don't know alot about it so we need to go there. Going to venus can be benitfical in may ways. One way is thet it can give scientist good research that they don't have. It can also give them a way as said in the article ""to examine more closely"". Lastly we could gain more knowledge on living conditions in Venus.

Even though, Venus is not the safest palce for anyone or anything to be NASA has came up with new safetey measures to ensure the people's safetey. For one as said in the article Venus is a hot place. So NASA has came up with the idea that the people that will be going to venus would be floating on top of venus so that they will not only be safe but alive. Another way to ensure saftey is to use silicon devices since metal melts on Venus, and studies have shown that using silicon is efficient, and in the article is said to last ""for three weeks"".

Furthermore, not only do they have saftey measures they also uses technolgy. From past reasearch it is known that Venus burns metal so that means that to have good resaerch you have to find somthing that is not meatal to conduct your resarch. So NASA has made another project when they look at old technolgy, and they realised that mechanical computers would help when researching Venus. Mechanical computers conduct ""calculations by using gears and levers"". Also mechanical computers does not need electronics at all.

In other words going to Venus can be very resourcful and problaly become of use in the future.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"""I say we change!"" Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States can be a way better idea to do than keeping the Electoral college. In the Electoral College system the voters dont vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors & those slate of electors who in turn elect the president. In Source 2 they talk about why the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. In my own opinion, I think that by changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. In Electoral College, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct election of the kind we have now.

In source 1, they talk about what is the Electoral College & how it works. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. It's process consists of the selection of the electors, a meeting of the electors where they vote for President & Vice President, & the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. In the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Colubia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposesof the Electoral College. The word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state's electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a 'winner take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

In source 2, they talk about why the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas, & wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors in first place. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors & vote for the wrong candidate. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legilature nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Many places such as Vauban, Germany have given up the usage of cars. Vauban is a gworing trend in europe and the United Sates because of the postive effects of not using cars. One of the biggest examples is polution, also the removal of cars would ultimatley lead to a finacial increase in our economy, lastly making this change positivley effects our future.

First I would like to talk about a huge problem we face as a society today and that is green house gasses. You may not think that these are a big deal put if left unchecked they caan become a huge problem. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emisions in europe, and up to 50 percent in car-intensive areas. This can become a huge problem ranging from acid rain to climate change. An example of what polution can do to a city is in paris they are putting a partial ban on cars because of how how bad there polution is. There was a huge smog problem because green house gasses were being trapped because of hot days and cold nights.

Also this change can have amazing effects on that areas economy. Because there will be no cars people will take the bus witch is less than payinf for gas or they can walk to closer places. Also gas prices would decrease for other forms of tranpertation because there wouldnt be cars demanding the fuel. family could sell there cars and spend the money they were using to fund there car other thing witch will lead to the people being happier. Also the removal of cars will lead to teh creation of jobd because they will need people to operate public transportation.

Lastly the removal of cars will have a postive effect on the future of our world. With the track were on now the world is estimated to heat up and have negative consequences on our society. these climate changes may seem small but they can have drastic effects. in china there is a lake that is so polluted you set the top of it on fire because there is so much polutants on it. also this chang has coralation with peoples happiness. Were already started down the path of less cars, recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less adn getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

For the following benifits is why we should stop using cars and continue with the idea of using public tranportation and walking. Cars creat polution, its better for our economy to stop the use of cars and this will poitivley effect out furute. Also one last reason for why the beifits outweigh the harms is that we have started the removal of cars all it has shown is positive effects",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"The use of this technology to ready the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Why? to me this idea has some pros and cons. In the case of the Mona Lisa it seems a lot more reasonalbe to use this type of technology because in reality if we just look at the painting we dont know what her emotions are but since whis new Facial Action Coding System came out it'd be a lot more usefull on her than in students in a classroom.

Now these days students don't have a lot of excitment to come to school and are often distracted with the other things going on around them. If you have the Facial Action Coding System have them identify their emotions they will pay even less more attention in class. Wether or not a student isn't as excited to do math homework is the FACS gonna be able to change the students way of feeling towards the homework? Will the students way of feeling about homework change by a computer system? I honestly dont think it'd be a good idea to have that kind of system in a classroom.

In my opinion the idea of having it in a classroom is a bad idea. This system may work on other things but not in a classroom with students. This system can also fail. If a student is happy but just has a serious face the sysytem is going to go by what the student looks like not the way he/she actually feels inside.

Technology now a days is taking over everything, this FACS

will just make people much lazier because they know that instead of asking the way they feel they'll just want to use the system because its much faster and easier instead of going up to the person and actually asking how they feel. It'll create less comunication with one another.

The Facial Action Coding System doesn't seem to me a useful technology system for students in a classroom.",2,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Cars will always be one of the greatest inventions of all time, among the wheel and electricity, but they have some terrible side affects. Cars are one of the leading causes of pollution in the world. They are also very expensive to own and operate. By limiting car usage, you could cut down and costs and protect the environment.

By not using cars, it could drastically improve the environment. In Paris they banned driving because of smog, and now they have no smog and a much cleaner city. If driving limits were placed everywhere, then this could happen worldwide.

Everyone knows that cars are very expensive, to buy one knew can set you back tens of thousands of dollars. And then a few years down the road it breaks down, to fix it can costs you thousands. Not to mention inssurance and gas. Just imagine how much money you could have if you didnt ever have a car. You could practically buy a house with the savings. That could happen to everyone if we limited the use of cars.

In conclusion, there are many advantages to limiting car use such as saving the environment and saving money. We need to follow Paris's example and cut out car usage in cities to create a healthier world.",1,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Technology improves every minute and it seems like there is no stopping. Reading emotions on a persons face can be confusing sometimes, so Prof. Thomas Huang, of Beckman Institute, and Prof Nicu Sebe, from University of Amsterdam, worked together to come up wiht technology that can read human emotions. Using emotion reading computer can be useful when it comes to school, because teachers and students deal with different emotions from their classmates/ colleagues every day. The first benefit is that it will help teachers and student figure each others emotion. Second, is it will make others be more active. Lastly, it lets others know what your emotions are.

First of all, because there are so many facial expressions that teachers often have difficulty reading their students emotions and lots of times that causes confusion among each other. For example, the text states that, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr.Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees od expression'(like not smiling as broadly)."" This technology will be able to help teachers and or students have an easier way of reading each others emotion. In advance, it can calculate the different types of emotions that a person may be expressing all at once. The text states, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece).""

Secondly, it will help others be more active, that meaning students will show more happier emotions if the teachers can understand them. More over, Understanding students emiotions will help teachers have more of a positive way of viewing their students. In addition, recognizing a student emotional expression when learning a lesson can help the teachers teach more effectivly with the help of the technology. For example, the text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confusd or bored, Dr Huang predicts. ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Third, although letting others know your emotions can sometime be scary because some emotions can mean weakness, the computer can give specific emotions that a person is expressing. When you see a friend or

teacher sometimes it is very hard to tell their emotions that they are expressing, but maybe with this technology it will be easier for us to understand them. Because most human connect nonverbally, our emotional communications is considered nonverbal communication and the computer has those skills. The text says, ""Most human communications is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So the computers need to understand that, too.""

In conclusion, using this technology in classrooms can be very useful. It will help teachers and student figure your emotions.",3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The author supports the idea of studying Venus because Venus was the first chose of Earth before they discovered Earth . Also it could've been life since their is so much water their so it can support people way of living . Plus the planet has valleys , mountains, and craters just like Earth does . Including they are making sure that it is safe for humans to travel there . Also their would be more of a different type of lifestyle on Venus so humans on Earth can discover a new enviorment and world .

Venus is a different life upon humans . Extremely so that the technology we have today can out beat the technology from the 1800s or the 1940s . The calculations of a moder computer are powerful for the people NASA it's helps prevent any physical conditions that can happen to the travlers . Also the distance wouldn't be so bad for the people on Earth . Plus NASA is discovering on how to start life their for people who wants to start over again and be in a better year around world they can .

The author also thinks that the risks aren't very harmful to humans . Including since the sun is so close to Venus he discovered that there would be more better warmer days than winter days . Venus could be the next Florida for people who love to be warm . The author also states that Venus is a beautiful planet from just studying the features of it so why wouldn't it be beautiful to live on .

Venus oxygen also is better there yes there maybe a few storms but you'll never have to rely on trees for saving your life .

Venus also is the nearest option for a visit because if anything happen to Earth where would people go ? Venus of course because at this point the NASA people would have knowledge to know that the other world we have would be the next best place for us .Including the value of Venus is great because the farms that can be planeted their would be healiter foods for people . The water in Venus is safe and is not deadly for the travelers . Also it would be more cheaper and a better government there in Venus .

In conclusion Venus has so many great values and amazing different way to look at life it's self . Have a different type of lifestyle when you wake up in the morning . Including waking up to that nice hot weather and very sunny out . Also seeing different animals . Plus just having a better view at life .",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Limiting the usage of cars has a varirty of advantages. From having a less expensive life, to less air pollution, and overall a generally happier life. Thinking about all the excess and stress that comes with owning a car is tiring. Not to mention the hazardous effect it had on our lives. Would it not be nice to just take off some of that burden off of you, and be a happier person?.Let me help you out on how to achieve that.

Owning a car is pricey! In Freiburg along with paying for your house you also have to pay for a parking garage, which comes with a hefty price. Did i not mention the distance you have to walk to park? lets just say you might as well have taken the bus.""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park---large garages at the edge of the development,where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home.""(source one,section two). With you alone driving to work and back everyday will tally up to over a hundred dollars spent every week, now add children into it, and their after school ativities, also add emergencies. See where this is going? sure you might need a car now and then, having a car is not a bad thing. How about Carpooling? It will reduce that price you have on your gas recipts and create more time for bonding and interacting with people.

Health or driving? Well if you are not healthy you can not drive can you? With all of the automobiles we have today it is bound to affect the earth. The smog in the air leading to that first cough that can lead to something more terminal. Imagine what it would be like if you had less cars, or even no cars at all! well the capital of France tried it and the results were amazing.""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..""(source two,section fourteen).  Now think about if that ban that Paris enforced,was tried out in other countries. Just that little change in the amount of cars on the road let to that difference of the pollution. Probably led to a difference in someones health too.

Everything stated above leads to happiness, from the less expences that will have to be paid, and the less damage that the pollution will have on your health. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter""source one, section three).Also when there are less cars on the road your community will be able to connect more and have better infranstructure, which would make them  happy just like it did for the people of Bogata, Columbia.""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks;rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic;and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up.""(source three,section twenty-eight).

Overall the advantages of limiting car usage has many benefits to it. From having a less expensive life, by not having to pay for gas so often, car insurance, and evrything else that comes with it. Having better health also is a advantage of the limitation of car usage. Also one of the most important aspects of life, happiness comes with the limitation of using cars. So there is no reason to not try it out, there will be more benefits.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"There are many reasons to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. Not only do you get to travel around the world you get to help others who countrie or town that has been detroyed. Many people liked the outcome from their trip and you probably will too. You dont have to do it every year but if you would like to you can. You might be gone from your family for a while.

Can you just picture yourself traveling around and going places that you might only can go one chance out of a lifetime? In the passage in paragraph one it states how Luke felt about going on the trip, ""He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime."" Would you want to miss out? I sure wouldn't. All you have to do is join the UNRRA.

The UNRRA stands for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administraction. The only bad thing about the trip is that you still have to work. The article includes some information in paragraph 2 that during the program you have to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. Your probably thinking ew,no gross, but this is progress of helping the coutries that have been ruined. Keep in mind that this is a good cause, the animals need comfort too.

Next, the good part about the trip is the unique place you would be going. In paragraph 5 it states, ""Luke had made nine trips---the most of any Seagoing Cowboy."" That can be one of your goals if you join the program. Not only did Luke and Don and others just travel they also had free time. They played baseball and volleyball games and many more but they also got to explore freely around the countrie they were in.

Also, in paragraph 9 includes, ""But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke Bomberger. It opened up the world to him. ""I'm grateful for the opportunity"" he says. ""It made more aware of other people of other countries and their needes."" In conclusion, let Luke's inspiring trip be a goal for you to be apart of the UNRRA program.",2,2,3,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. It was not created by aliens. If it was created by aliens, Then the discovery would benefit NASA. I can help you to understand why it is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

The face was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like a face. Eighteen years after the face was discovered, we sent Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team to take a picture ten times sharper of the face. In the picture, It was revealed that it was just a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Later, there was a second picture taken up close even more than before. There were no signs of alien existence around the landform.

After looking at all the pictures taken and research found, we can conclude that there was no alien monument to begin with. Like I said, it was just another natural landform. Has you understanding about the face changed?",1,3,2,3,2,2,2,1,3
"In the artical ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the idea of exporing Venus dispite the dangers none clearly. The author gives some good point on both ideas, of visiting it and giving up on it. In the artical it states "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and wether present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking land on its surface"" (paragraph 3). This shows that the author is worried about the conditions we do have to over come to go, but this sounds like a point were he doesn't want us to try to go. The artical also states "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" (paragraph 4). This also shows that he has his dought about studing Venus. The artical also states "" ...reserachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (paragraph 6).This shows that he does want us to be able to study Venus, but we cannot get close enough to its surface to study it.

"In my opinion, I'm against these type of cars. Yes, there are a lot of positives about them, but that doesn't mean they are completely safe and will help humanity.

I can foresee these cars becoming a huge issue. One of those issues I can see happening is that these cars, yeah, they seem safe. Are they really safe though? It seems to me like these cars would get in accidents very easy and could severly hurt someone. Lets say you aren't paying attention to the road, imagine if someone swerves in front of you and its so fast your car doesn't pick up on it. You could end up in a sever accident and possible pass away from lack of paying attention.

Another issue I have with these cars being produced is that it would take away from tradition. Whats even the point of going through driver's ed when you can have an automatic car that does everything for you? It's a right of passage to get your first car and learn how to drive it. It gives you a sense of accomplishment. I wouldn't feel very proud of myself if my car just drove itself.

These are my biggest two problems with these cars being made, and I have more. These cars aren't going to help society they would end up simply destroying it.",1,3,0,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Driverless Cars sounds like a good idea, or is it a safe idea? Something that you can just sit in and the car will let you relax but you nedd to watch out for accidemts and traffic situations. Is that really neccesary? How much money are you wasting? I am aganist the development of these cars because there's no point for them.

First of all, I am against the development of these cars because there's no differences between a driverless car and a manual car. Both car's still can cause accidents to people, either driving and not. Not only that, the driver still have to be alert to the road either way too like paragraph 8 says, "" Safety is a big concern."" If driveless cars get into accidents, just like maual-driven cars, then there's no reason for these cars if we're just gonna get hurt driving them like regular cars now.

Also, It is also a really whole lot of money. I mean, It cost more than the regular-driven cars, especially the sensors and radars on the driveless vehicle. Paragraph 8 in the article says, ""It cost $200 million for a radar device on a hilltop,"" and no telling how much is it for a car with sensors, a radar, and it can drive by itself. I mean, some people might be able to afford that, like the rich people, but what about the poor? Are they lefted with the regular driven cars, or are they gonna make the price of the driveless cars as much of a regular car?

Don't get the wrong idea though, it's a great idea. Letting a car drive by itself with the driver on the wheel, and also, the car can find Its way to the driver's destination, or place, It's a perfect idea. Although, there not safe, and there expensive. Before the creators put the driveless vehicles on sale on the car sale businesses, like Nissan, or Ford, they should add more safety features, and make it more cheaper so most people with a driver lincense can have one.

In conclusion, I am against Driveless vehicles because there's no difference in the driveless cars and a manual car, and they are a waste of money. Driveless vehicles need to be all the way safe to drive in and don't cost a lot either. The maker's of these cars need to be sure that everything about the car is ok too. It's not a bad idea either, its a perfect one. Just make sure it's not a waste of money or time.",2,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Just another day working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.

Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was ""Alien's"", really alien's can they possibly pin this ""face"" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said ""How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!"" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist ""What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's"" he answered. ""First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?"" ""If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!"" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the ""Mesa""

The word on the ""Face"" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, ""Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!"" ""Of course, why wouldn't I?"" ""How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!"" ""How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that ""Mesa"" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!"" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.

April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the ""Face"" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa. As I heard of this new's I couldn't help but look back at that one scientist, and whipering ""Look who the right one is now!"" with the most accomplishing smirk on my face that I can make. ;]",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Many people think the Face on mars is a natural landform, but others think it was created by aliens. If there were an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would benefit from sharing their discovery with the public. Scientists figured it was another mesa which were common around Cydonia.

Some scientists believe it was in fact an alien artifact. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew ovver Cydonia it too a picture much sharper than the original photos. It revealed a natural landform which meant there was no alien monument. Some skeptics argued that alien markings were hidden by a haze. In 2001 another photo was taken. Each pixel spanned 1.56 meter compared to 43 meters in the 1976 photo.

The picture shows a butte or mesa which also appear in the american west. In this photo if there were anything abnormal you would be able to see it. Instead it is just a natural landform on Mars.",1,2,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"There is so many of emotions, and only we know if we want to show them or not. Emotional expressions help us to show how we feel, or we can only pretend them, that is why I am against with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. We have to think if they really want us to know what are they feeling? We all are humans, so we know that sometimes we feel embarresed of something, and we do not want to people know that. Adding to these we have to have our privacity.

Our emotions expressions help us to show how we feel. If we are sad we have a sad face, if angry we have a face that reference that we are angry as on the paragraph number 5 says "" for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". So there is no reason to have the Facial Action Coding enables computers to identify human emotions.

Emotions expression can also being prentend them. Every single person has problems, and sometimes we are shy to let them know to other people, so we need our privacity, and we have to pretend that everything is all right, when maybe is not like that. If someone is sad, but he/she wants to look she is happy, so there is nothing to do, because is her/his decision. We have to think in the point of view. We can see on paragraph number 6 says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becaming confused or bored"" what about if the student feels emberresed, if everybody that he is the one who does not understans a topic?

But also the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions can help, but if the person wants to. Because people sometimes does not know how to tell people how they feel. Also it could help in differents ways to different careers. For example the police career, when they interrogate people, they can notice if they are telling the truth or they are just lying.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System anables computers to identify human emtions have to be used only in a special case. We have our own emotions, and our unique forms to show how we feel. If we want to be reserved is our desicion, and if we want to show our emotional expressions it is okay as well. Only we decide how to feel, and if we should show our emotions up. We have a right that is call personal privacity, we have to remember that.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Some cars are to loud and causes alot of polution in the world today. The most problem is the  polution thats coming out of the cars. Limiting the usage of your car can become a big help in the community today, not only that it can help our atmosphere and the air that breathe from sun up to sun down. For years people have been using the cars that run on fuel that polutes our air. some countries do not like speacialy Paris. Lets find out more why Paris dont like fuel using cars.

Paris enforced laws that ban car usage to clear the air of the global city. Motorists that has driving licences were ordered to leave their vehicles home. If they did not follow that law they would have to pay a $31(22-euro) fine. Some people had their car impounded due to their reaction for paying the fine. THAts when they came up with an idea by making cars that run on electicty or solar to cut down fuel usage. For this reason, car traffic was down atleast 60% in the capital of France. Thats one reason why you should limit your car uasage.

Bogota, Colombia made up an event, they called it car-free day. Thats when  everybody leave their cars home. Thats the day when you would had hiked,biked, skated or even took the bus to work or where ever you were going. The reason for them making that up was to promote alternative transportation and to reduce smog. If you didnt follow this event you would have to face a $25 fine. Even though on somedays it would rain, it hasnt stop people from participating. This was a way to cut down stress on people and to reduce ait polution. THis event has spreaded through cities. This is an another advantage for limiting car usage.

Now, this is an amazing expierence. You may be thinking,""This is a boring expierence,"" But, it's not. This is such a great expierence because of all of the things you get to do. You get to take care of cattle, store food, and of course, travel. You will probably get to see many awesome places. Now, this leads me to my next paragraph.

This still helps you because along the way you get to learn about new things, and see new things like Europe and China. After you join this program, you will probably never want to leave.

Finally, one of the most importanat reasons for joining the Seagoing Cowboys is that you are helping other people. You may think,""I thought this was about us having a good time,"" which it is, but you also are doing this to help people. You are doing this to help the people who's houses and towns have been ruined in World War II, this is why you are caring for the cattle, storing the food, and doing all of the traveling. This is obvioulsly the best trip you will ever take in your life.

Obviously, this is a great expierence, your visiting places, and you are helping people, but you are also, having a LOT of fun along the way. Of course you only get to have this fun and excitement if you joing the Seagoing Cowboys program. Why don't you make a difference while having a lot of fun, isn't it what you've always wanted?",3,3,0,3,0,0,1,1,0
"Hook: The study of stars and planets is part of the NASA and some universities.

Counter claim: Some people at the collage study advance astronomy so they could work on the NASA and evoid any problems.

Thesis: Many plantes in the cosmos have different characteristics than the Earth.

The advantage of studying Venus is important, just like the other planets in the solar system, so the NASA can send drons to explore Venus or Mars.

Unlike the atmosphere of earth, Venus is most percent of temperature and carbon dioxide, it states ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus.""

Studying this kinds of things help to those that look for stars planet to see the differences of Venus and Earth. It's not just the atmosphere, is also for example, the temperature. Carbon dioxide is more higher than the earth's and more plants here.

one problem is that the NASA sends humans to study the all about venus just to see the hostiles conditions of the planet, considerating that there were none of them. Venus was almost like the Earth, but now is all rock and dusty with some risk there, it claims, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life, just like Earth.""

studying the astronomy like venus, it also show the history of other planets and how were they before. The men who travel to Venus leran about the challenges and risk because of the ground's condition, the temperature, atmosphere, anything. A most safe way is that people learn astronomy before travel to Venus. And those who retuned have make reseasch about the planet to study more.

To the finish this, the author is right aboth the study of Venus, so the men could not be in danger out there on the planet. The challenges on venus are more than human being could ever live and learned and survey.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Luke's point of view convincing others to participate in the seagoing cows program.

Luke did not know that when he grauated from high school it will become hard. He has to work two part time job to get money to buy his own stuff.

So one day his friend asked him to go to Europe with him he could not say no because it was a big opportunity of a lifetime.

In 1945 world war two was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. To help these countries recover there food supplies animals and more 44 nations joined together to help these people get all the things they need and all they supplies they need to help the animals thats why Luke and Dan sign up to help the animals and peole to get better and get the stuff they need to survive.

Thats why Luke and this friend Dan wants you to be in the seagoing cowboy group beacuse wants you to learn how to help other and do somethink nice just to do it and just to give because giving is nice beacause some people in that country like i said dont have food supplies now if you help them get that they will have enough to feed kids themselfs and others that dont have food.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a lot of technology being made to try to help human communication. Computers can read the emotions on the face of a human. Isn't that awesome !? This could help out with things that some humans dont want to say. Like depression or worriness ect. However some people still say that this technology will not be useful. I toatally disagree ! Think on the brighter side.

With this new technology it could be a little easier on the students. It could help the teachers know what type of mood the student is in. This would probably help by the teachers showing empathy to the students. Also this could stop conflicts with students. When two students are feeling angry you could remove them. I think this Technology is very valuable.

Also having a computer that know how your feeling at the moment would be such a big help. If it knows your feeling sad it could post ads to try to cheer you up. If your feeling happy it could play music to go with your spirit. When you are feeling confused about something , it could ask do you need help ? Also if you get bored with something it could make the next assignment different.

Evidence to support my claim that this technology is valuable is all through ""Making mona Lisa Smile"". "" Imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."" ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts. ""it could modify the lesson, like a effective human instructor.""

It also could be valuable by helping make computer animated faces more expressive.""Most human communicvation is nonverable, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang.""So computers need to understand that, too.

This technology called the Facial Action Coding System reading the expression of studednts is very valuable. It helps with showing empathy,It helps understand some reasons behind things ect. This technoly is so valuable because it can help stop so many conlicts, failures and save students education. If this technology keeps evolving no wonder what they'll have in the future. Maybe technoly that actually coversates with you with a real brain? Only time will tell.",2,3,3,2,0,1,1,1,0
"What I think bout this is that really, it can either goes both ways but manily the technology would work more because of the different types of machine that are working to figure things out, like for example it could tell you weather or not if you are nervous or not, if you are lying or not. The techmology now days are so much helpful to figure certain stuff out like what the weather goona be like throught out the week or just stuff like that. Now on the other hand you can figure stuff out on your on because you can feel certain stuff that is wrong with ya like, for Example you can wake up and just know today is not my day...I mean come on now like you just know if someone talks to you the wrong way you are gonna pop off or if someone looks at you the wrong way you are gonna flip out about it and start going off. You can know or not if you are not feeling it today because really its a mind set thing...You have to process you mind to certain and be like you know this is not the right thing to do you just know it. So like I said it can go both ways .I hope you enjoy this",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The planet Venus is a very strange place. Scientists have very little knowledge about this Earth-like planet with an atmosphere that contains 97 percent carbon dioxide. Venus is one of two closest planets that we can visit and learn about (the second being Mars). Although we have sent vessels to Mars to study the area none of them prove a challenge as much as the ones sent to Venus do. The extremeities of weather on Venus prove pretty difficult to allow spacecrafts to land upon its surface.

Scientists discribe Venus as being the closest planet for planetary visit. If it weren't for the the obscurity of Venus we would have more information on it. The thick layer of carbon dioxide in Venus's atmosphere and a atmospheric pressure which seems to be 90 times stronger than Earth's makes it pretty difficult for further inspection up close of Venus. If a spacecraft can't land there much less a manned ship. The 800 degree weather and clouds full of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also causes problems for spacecrafts to land on Venus.

Although it might be tough scientists are not giving up hope on trying to reach Venus since it is one planet that closely resembles Earth. Venus has many similarities to Earth such as a rocky surface with sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It is also higly probable that Venus's surface was covered in large oceans wich made it a planet that can support life. If we knew what caused Venus to turn this uninhabitable we could figure out a way to reverse it and make it safe to live on.

If scientists find a way to land a spacecraft onto Venus's surface we could find out if it still has some form of life on it and start a mission to reenable Venus to be habitable for humans. Even if such a thing is possible it is going to take a very, very long time to figure it all out. The reason scientists aren't giving up on the exloration of Venus is because of the fact that the human population is growing and growing pretty quick. If we run out of space or resources we don't know what will happen to the future human race.

We need Venus as a back up plan. Venus will serve as a way to expand even without running out of space on Earth. Either way the exploration of Venus is such a neccesity to us that we can't give it up. One day in the future some people will be ble to call Venus there home. That is what gives me hope for the future. There is one part of me that thinks what if we never manage to make Venus reinhabitable. WIll natural selecetion take place ? Will the human race get diminished by nuclear weaponry? Who knows what can take place for our future. All we can do know is to continue to live life to the fullest and hope for the best.",3,3,0,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Cars are changing now more than ever before. Some of the changes that cars are going through are good while some of them aren't so good. We need cars to get places. In the first paragraph it says ""He envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleetd of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system."" Not everyone is comfortable with that and not all people want a public transportation stayem to use. What if they like being alone and away from all the people? Will there still be cars that aren't driverless? Or will the population of cars that need to be driven not exist anymore?

Going against this is better thasn being for it. Most people spent a lot of time and money getting there license and taking classes to learn how to drive and then that all just gets taken away by driverless cars or transportation syatems. It's not the best idea to do that. What if the driverless items don't get used? It would cost lots of money and people would lose there jobs because of this like taxi drivers, bus drivers, and people that teach drivers ed; but it's good that cars do have the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" or other things in their car that help prevent accidents and other things of that sort. We need things like the Traffic Jam Assistant because it helps people out for example in paragraph seven it says that The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" That means that it could save a persons life. By just having a sensor in your car can help save your life that's the kind of thing that we need in cars today.

So instead of having driverless cars why don't we put systems like the Traffic Jam Assistant in cars to help people out. It;s really pointless to go out of your way and spend so much money to create something that we don't even know will work yet last. So what if the power went out in the city and then the ""back up"" generator kicked in then it got shut down by the big storm. What would happen to the people that have to go get their kids of are already out doing things and need to get home to see if their families are okay. What do you do then if there are no regular cars and the power doesnt work nothing does? That's why we don't need driverless cars and or transpotation systems.",3,2,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Fellow citizens should know about the advantages of limiting car usage. It is less stressful and it saves money. It does not pollute the air as much and keeps the global healthier. Limiting the car usage helps a alot to the citizens and to the earth.

One advantage of limiting car usage is that it is less stressful and it helps you save money. From source 1, Hedirun Walter said "" When I had a car I was always tense."" In the community you could own a car but you were not allowed to park wherever you wanted. You had to park it in large garages and you have to buy space for $40,000 with a home. So most people didn't have cars but they were saving lots of money. 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there cars to move to the community. Most of the people liked walking around the community or just taking the transportation they gave them. It peaceful and less traffic.

Another advantage is that it reduces pollution and also reduces global warming. From source 2, ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" If they did not leave thier cars at home they would have to pay a fine, 22-euro ($31). After they have had the cars off the streets ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the of france, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer to trap car emissions. They also blamed the diesel fuel...""A tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vechicles in france, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines..""

From source 3, Colombia had a ""car-free day"" where all colombians hiked, biked, skated or took the transportion buses to work. For 3 years they have been doing this being they wanted to reuduce the smog. People who disobeyed had to pay $25 fines. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,""said businessman Carlos Arthuro. Since people have started waliking or riding bicyles, they have improved the city by fixing the uneven sidewalks and making them smooth. Also since there is no traffic, "" new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""

In conclusion, there are many advantages limiting car usage. It saves money, helps the enviroment and a human's health. Limiting the car usage teaches the citizens that we also have to car about the enviroment and that is it less dangerous.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"Dear State Senitor,

The Electoral College is an ineffeciant way to cast presidential votes.  We the people vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  If we were to change to election by popular vote then the elecions would be truly fair.  After all, it was said by our founding fathers that we the people are who change the government and the face of our nation.  It would lead to more voters and an overall better quality of said electee.

The Electoral college voting system is flawed in many different aspects, such as the chance we take of electing electors that may be biased as much as to betray their pledge and vote for a presidential canidate that you did not vote for them to vote for.  Voters cannot control whom their electors vote for.

The Electoral college is unfair to voters and irration in all.  It is anachronial and non reliable and should be abolished and replaced.",1,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,1
"The planet of Venus is considered to be a danger to humans given the conditions it is in. In the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that depsite the dangers presented by Venus, it would be a worthy pursuit to study the planet. The author helpfully establishes multiple key pieces of evidence supporting this claim such as Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit, and trying to get to Venus is considered a challenge that could help humans prepare for even more extremely challenging environments.

In paragraph two, the author states ""Often refered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest distance too."" This quote, along with this quote, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" showcase exactly how alike Venus may have been to Earth. This could be helpful in studying the possibilities of what may eventually happen to planet Earth.

Not many planets are as close to Earth as Venus is and that is a crucial point when the amount of time space travel can take is taken into consideration. Humans have accomplished and gained much knowledge about space travel since the race to space began. Scientists' have meticulously studied everything they could learn about space and can even estimate how much time it would take to travel to different places in space. This is crucial when you take into consideration how much time, effort, and money goes into space travel. With Venus being so close to the Earth, and all those factors taken into consideration, it seems to be an obvious and intelligent choice to make that humans should not give up on travelling and studying Venus. More than anything, it would be a wasted opportunity.

While the idea of being able to study Venus seems daunting, perhaps it is only the lack of courage that is holding NASA back from doing it. Curiosity is a natural thing that all humans are born with, and it never goes away. This is relevant because with curiosity, the gain of knowledge can go hand in hand with it. Without curiosity, not even half of the things humans have done and developed would be possible. Shying away from Venus is doing more harm than good, and it will only serve to produce hesitancy at the sight of any challege.

The author of the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" brings up many key points of evidence as to why Venus should be explored and studied, despite the dangers of it. Among those are, it is the closest planet to Earth relatively speaking, Venus is the closest distance, and the study of the planet Venus brings up a unique challenge to the human race that backing down from would be detrimental. All of the key points supports the author's idea that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2
"In my opinion, yes that would be very helpful and valuable to have that type of technology in our classrooms. heres why.

A lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things, like shooting up a school full of kids. If we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point. If we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life. If we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v. s. teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea.

Another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning. Say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring. If we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student. Every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school.

Not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better. We could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling. Not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities. If they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie. Maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught.

In conclusion, having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination. If we had this, maybe, just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,1
"I think we should change the elction to popular vote. we should get what the people want not what the government or the system want. under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal.

No region has electoral cotes to elect president. So a solid regional favorite, such as romney was in the south has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful presidat. the residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfrabchished that the new president will have no regard for their intrests, that he really isn't their president.

The winner take all method of awarding electoral votes induces the canidates as we saw in 2012's election. voters in toss-up states are most likely to pay close attention to the campaign. they are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, average and the most thoughtful voters hsould be the ones to dcide the election.",1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
"I do not think that the author supported his idea to the fullest. He could have just done better because he never made it clear about his descion. there were just too much negatve about going to venus theres are 4 postive things about why we should go to venus. ""solar pwer would be plentiful , and radiation wouldnt exceed earth levels not easy conditions but survivable for humans .

He supported his argument very few places of the passage. The text states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment includes familiar features such as valleys and mountain. He also supported his argument with ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life . which means that the planet could be inhabitable by humans.

He made his argument worse by putting all of the dangerous stuff intot the text. The author says ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous misson was unmanned.""

Which means that it has been to difficult to go there for breif periods at a time. "" A thich atmosphere of almoost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus."" Which means that it is very inhabitibal for humans.

If i had to guess on which side the author would have been for : try and explore the plane or Stop trying because it is too dangerous I would have to say that he is on the stop trying it is too dangerous side. I think this because compared to the postive stuff it says to venus it has a lot of bad facts and good reasons on why we shouldnt go there. in my mind i do not think that he got his point out enough to say he wants us to go to Venus .

In my opinion Venus is too dnagerous for us to survive there and live there. I think that exploring there is just a waste of money because "" each previous mission has been unmanned and you shouldnt just keep trying. the author believes that there should be money invested into the reseach of venus. I do not agree with him. And i feel as though we as humans should explore some where more inhabitable",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0

Reason two, is you get to take care of animals like horses, young cows, and mules. Reason three is that you'll become an seagoing cowboy.

You get to help countries and animals. To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations will join together to form UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabliltation Adminstration). Seagoing Cowboys will take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped oversea. It will make you more aware of people of the countries and their needs. And that awareness will stay with you.

It will much of an adventure to you. You'll have fun on board especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. You'll get to play many games like baseball, volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, whittling, and games also helped pass the time. Sometimes you will be served as night watchman. That job means to check on the nails every hour.

"Imagine a world when all you see is people sitting in their cars and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. That seems very scary to me. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea or the way to be going for the future. Driverless cars could lead to many fatal accidents and also many injuries.

My first argument is that technology always seems to fail. When you get a new iPhone, sometimes not everything is right in the phone or something is messed up from the start. If we had driverless cars in the future, technology would be the key function to make the car work. What if the technology failed like what seems to happen many times to iPhone users. I think having driverless cars is putting too much belief and risk into technology. You can never say when a problem would quickly approach or is about to happen, it just happens. If a problem just happened in a driverless car when the driver wasn't paying that much attention to the road, many accidents and fatalities would be on the rise.

In conclusion, I think the idea of driverless cars are very unique and out there, but as of right now and the technology we have, I could not put my full trust in a driverless car. Today, the technology and sensors needed for a full driverless car seem very unrealistic. Sensors created for the driverless car would be tested many times, but if it fails when it isn't being tested that can cause too much harm for everyone and everything in the world around us. I believe that we should stick with normal human driving for the safety of everyone.",1,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"What would you do if you got written a ticket by a police officer for just driving your car? It could happen if we had a day that driving was banned to help the enviroment. I think this is great idea and we shold all get involved with trying to make it work. Other countries have done it and it doesn't seem to effect anybody negativly. The only thing this would do is limit the pollution put off in America and all over.

Cars are probably the biggest source of pollution in our world today. We use cars for eveerything now and it is very convenient but have you ever really thought of what they are doing to our atmoshpere and ozone. Smog is one of the biggest efects from driving and its not a pretty one. I wouldn't want my city to be covered in a thick layer of foggy gas fuems. In paris the smog was so thick they had to make driving outlawed for a few days just to keep it under control. If we did it even just a couple times a year nation wide it could really help.

In columbia they tried this to help with car emisions and everybody enjoyed it. They even said other countrioes joined in so I think its our turn to give it a try.

The people of Vauban, Germany have a pretty much car free town. If towns started going car free like this in America the emmisions would drop greatly. In Vauban evrybody really likes not needing cars and say it is much less stressful than driving everyday. If just one in every 20 cities of the United States went car free we would notice how much cleaner the air is and the greenhouse effect or global warming would be almost nonexistent.

Another thing the articles mentioned is hybrid cars. I think hybrid cars are great, I personally have one, but some people don't really understand or like them. These cars could really help save the enviroment in just a few years if people were to start only using them. Which I doubt will happen but they still are driven by many people and its much better then everyone driving a diesel truck around all the time.

In all honesty I don't think any of this will happen here anytime soon but it sure would be nice. The greenhouse effect is very real no matter how many people argue about it and there is thigs that can be done to help prevent it. We just have to be willing to make some sacrafices to save our planet.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I think that driverless cars shouldn't be developed. These cars shouldn't be developed for many reasons. As of right now, the cars still need driver assistance, but in the future they may not. What will that lead to though? These cars are not completely safe and accident free, many thingscan still happen. These cars shouldn't be developed because it can cause more accidents, the cars may malfunction and the driver wouldn't be capable of conrolling the car themselves, and then there is the problem of some people using these driverless cars, and some people won't be able to use them, which could cause problems as well.

One reason why this car shouldn't be developed is because it can cause more accidents. Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver states, ""The car psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge. We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" He is basically saying that this is actually a pretty big challenge, because there are safety requirements that need to be met. There is also no laws for these cars. What happens if someone gets injured? Who is going to be reliable for the injury? Laws are writtern with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. This seems to be true. You can't always rely on robots, as I know you can't always rely on people, but when it comes to crunch time, and you need to make a big decision on the wheel, people are going to do what's best for them, robots are only going to do what they have been controlled to do. Also, these cars can only handle functions up to 25 MPH. There are speed limits that are way above this, and since there are no laws that would help it, the driver may get tickets for noy following the law of the speed limit. Whe you look at the facts, this could cause serious disruptions, serious injuries, and many mishaps on the road.

Another reason why these ars shouldn;t be developed are because the cars could malfunction at any time. You can't always rely on robots. They are only programmed to control certian situations, not all situations. As of right now, the cars aren't reliable enough. It states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" We need to take these things into consideration. Many people are ignorant, and may not pay attntion to te notifications it sends out. This is an accident waiting to happen. What if the driver doesn't hear the alert, or isn't paying attention becaause they give full control to the car? Then things will go wrong, which could lead to accidnets or injuries. Also, it says that the car steers, accelerates, and brakes itself. This can cause problems as well. Since everyone won't have these cars, the car is going to have to rely on the other drivers on the road with them. They are going to have to worry about when the car in front of them goes or stops, when they pull out or pull in somewhere, if an accident happens in front of them, or if there is a road condition that they need to avoid. Also, there is the scenario with lights. WIll the cars be able to stop at lights, or stop signs on there own? If not then this could cause huge accidents.

The last problem is that some people won't be able to use them, and if they do, not efficiently. People, simply put, are stupid, so why would you rely on them to take over a car when the car stops working by itsself? You wouldn't. Some people also have disabilities that can cause them to not hear or snese the notifications, and well there is people who won't be paying attention to the =m either in all honesty. You have to put these things into consideration when making these revolutionary chnages to the world. One incident in the programming could cause serious catastrophic events. Also, not everyone will be able to afford one of these cars. If people can't afford some of these cars, then that woudn't be safe. There would be some drivers that would have the cars, and some that won't. Basically what I'm saying is that some people will go off their instinct and knowledge while driving, while others go off computer programming.That isn't a good idea, ebacsue usually people use signals with each other to figure what they need to do, but the car won't be able to do that. It just isn't safe for the roads to have both driverless cars, and cars that need drivers in them at the same time. People may argue that these kind of ideas are good, and that after all, the cars may be revolutionary and help the world. It's just that robots can't be trusted, as certainly as people can't be either, but people will be able to make the best decision based on the current events at the time. Just think, have you ever seen Irobot? Anything could happe, and many malfunctions could occur.

To basically sum this up, the development of these cars are a bad idea. There will be many more accidents, more malfunctions, and the incapability of people wouldn't help any either. I think that this is a very bad idea, and as much as I want it to be a good diea, I just can't see it turning out fot he best.",4,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The Mona Lisa's mood was never really made out to be one emotion.Looking at this painting would have anyone confused as to what was running through he r mind at that exact moment or what was going on around her.Leonardo da Vinci captured what seems to be a smirk or even a face of mixed emotions.

The Mona Lisa is known for having a multi-expression face,but in this day in age it can be determined by people all over the world exactly what she felt in that exact moment. ""She's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry...It's the subject of Leonardo di Vinci's Renaissance painting,Mona Lisa--at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions."" With this new amazing software it will be easier to read people and use this to analyze different types of people.

This advanced technology works much like us.""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' everyday.For instance,you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face''. Not only can this new tech help with human expressions,but this software can also help with education. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This new discovery can help the avarage student through a stressful and confusing class meaning grades would go up and students would be more succsesful in their acadimic career.

"The face on mars is a natural landfrom im my opinion. This is because They stated that the shadows were what was causing it to resemble a human face. It many have some featrues that are similar to a human but they are not identcial. Meaning if a living species such as a alien did create this it would be more semetrical. Many diffrent things could have causes the rock to form a human like resmeblence,such as a peice of debri hitting the surface of the rock causing indentations. As you can see in the first picture of the face from 1976 there are small feature that resmble eyes and

a nose. As the years progress the pictures look less and less like a human. In the picture from 2001 you can barley tell what the rock is. The scientist even stated the camera has such high quality that you could see a air plane on the gorund, so if they were any signs of a aliens making this we would have been able to see them. In the pictue it acually shows that the face is the same as a Butte or Mesa which are landform commonly found around the American West. Its even stated that the rock on mars is smillar to the butte found on Snake River of Idaho. The lava dome (Butte) is even the same height of the face on mars. There fore coming to the conclusion that the same natural occurence that formed on the Snake River in Idaho aslo fromed on mars causing what looked to be a human face.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In this article the author is telling us that facts about Venus how it's called the ""Evening star"" because it's the ""brightest points of the light in the sky night"" and it is a good place to examine, because of how close it is to the sun and earth, of its tempature, its heat, pressure, and how no spacecraft have landed there. But it's really dangerous in Venus.

It's dangerous in because, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets venus, their is also clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the plants surface temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then whats in our earth.

And If they were to explore venus NASA would need scientist to survive the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. They would need to make blimp-car like vehicles they need to hover for miles and miles becuase it's is 170 degrees fahrenheit which means they would burn real bad. and the lights need to be real good because they need to penetrate the dense of the atmosphere.

I think they shouldn't explore Venus because it's a suicide mission it's too hot a lot of co2 and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,0
"I'm wanting to keep the Electoral College because it comes in handy in our system for voting. They can help us break a tie between two competing candidates that want to become presidents of the United States. You may not think its a big deal but it is. I don't like the ""winner-take-all"" system, I find it unfair that the president can automatically win a vote from one state. They need to get use to the voting system instead of winning one automatically. The one thing I like about the voting system is that people can pick who would be the best candidate for our nation. For example, I find it a terrible mistake that people picked Obama and all the stuff he had promised in the pass and still haven't kept his words. In my opinion, I think Obama daughter can build a better system than him. It whatever though, it the people choice that they want Obama to be president of the United States. I just think he just a liar to our nation. Now back on to the subject, the Electoral College can be important to the system. The bad side of the Electoral college is that under its system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect for the president. The singel best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Us Americans should consider ourselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that the state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people. If you don't like my opinion, then make a new system that is close enough to be a consensus.",0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
"in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the auhor explains that a new peice of technology can calculate a humans emotions called the "" Facial Action Coding"".But is it really worth the students time to use technology just to learn about theirs or other feelings?. its just a waste of time. The technology can only do one thing as the article shows and its just to show what one's emotion are.

In the article paragraph 5 it states that "" in fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". This cleary shows just by looking at a friends face you can tell if they are okay or not, so we dont need a device to do it for us. in paragraph 6 it states "" For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar as appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.But if you frown, the next ad will be diffrent"". This shows that just a facial expression can chnage a ad , but is it really that helpful?, not many people watch ads as it is, they skip them. in paragraph 6 it also states "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". this shows that human communication is nonverbal for a good part but why does emotional communication need to be useful? what would we do with the results we got when we test the emotion device? text a friend and show what youre feeling for a quick second?. students will maybe use it at first , but will get tired of it because it just shows emotions and nothing else.

In paragraph 7 it states "" your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode mona lisa's smile"". this states your home computer cant show the emotons. So by that means you will need a certain device and that will be expensive. Why would a school spend lots and lots of money just for a dveice that shows emotions thta nobody will enventually use. Also is paragraph 7 it states "" these are the instructions for a face that looks happy.... they even indicate the diffrence betweena genuine smile and a forced one"". this shows the indication of a forced smile and a real one , but which people can tell if thier friends have a real or fake smile.

In conclusion we do not need a device to tell us our emotions. we can tell out emiotions and our freinds can too. This device is a waste of time and money for students. The students will use it a couple of times and wont use it because its programmed only to do one thing and thats to show our emotions. This device is not valuable for students just to show emotions.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0

"People are saying there's a face on mars. This is true, people are also questioning if aliens had put it there, it may just be a historical formation on the earth, reasearches believe it may just be a formation and not created by aliens. People have named this formation the ""Face on Mars"" it has become to be a very popular sight that people are wanting to see more and more of it. This is so popular that it has been in ""Hollywood films, appearded in books, magizines, and even talk shows.""

Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image.

The more research the reasearchers did the more facts they found. They had many sightings like this before and they figured maybe a alien did not put that figure on mars. Reasearchers may have thought this because there had been many different formations on earths surface, it was most likely caused by earths erosion or natural features. They compare some ideas to it just like the ""Middle Butte in the snake river of Idaho."" There had never been sightings of aliens before why would there be now.

The people that work for NASA believe that it most likely ended up being a formation in mars because of the research everyone has done they have come to find that there are most likely no aliens up on mars. They say this because they went back up and looked some more around the area where the face was found to see if there was a ""alien monument."" Come to find out there was no alien monument around or even located on mars so aliens did not cause this. Researchers believe that this was just a normal formation from the planet mars that just occured, but did people?

When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral. People were wanting to know what caused this and how was this caused. When they realesed the news from the NASA they thought the same thing well it had to be aliens. After all this was no formation by aliens it was simply a formation from the planet itself. After all of this was figured out what really caused it, it went more viral than it was before. It was more popular because everyone was talking about it and it occured in Hollywood movies,Books and even talk shows.

People were wanting to still believe that no landform can just make something like this. They thought how could this be. The planets have their wonders and wow's you just have to let the formations take place and see what amazing things can be done. Also have patience to see what really happened to the item that was found. You might just be amazed for once. Most don't think there could be such amazing feautures on the planets.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

if we didnt have cars to use you wouldnt car sales men and gasoline stations and car repair companies and car was businessesnlose alot of money and make them unemployed and it would be hard for them to look for a job in the disasterous economy of ours and it would make it worse than it already is . honestly to me i think this is outrageous for us to do that. there is no way that we can all just driving cars either we just have to find a better way to fuel up the car without hurtung the enviorment. and when that one day come we would stop this worldwide problem.",1,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Limiting on car usage has its advantages. Here are three reasons why i say limiting car usage has its advantages. Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. Dont you think that limiting on car has its advantages to?

To begin, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because you spend less money. When you spend twenty dollars a week or more on gas money for your car thats wasting money when you could just buy a bus pass for ten dollars and that will take u where u need to go for a week or more. Right there you just save ten dollars. what would you rather do spend twenty dollar a week on gas to get where you need to go or spend ten dollars a week on a bus pass which would also get u to where you need to go? Also you spend less money by limiting usage of cars by saving money on tickets. Now a days police pull you over any little thing wrong with your car and your tickets are just going to keep pileing up then if you dont pay them or send them to court you licenses will be suspended. When you just could avoid all of that.

Middle, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less traffic. I know that in the passage, ""Source 3: Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it said,""BOGOTA, colombia- In a program that's set to spread to other countires, millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" but if more people are walking instead of taking cars there would be less traffic.

End, Limiting on car usage has its advantages because less car accidents. the more cars on the road the higher chance to get into a car accident. I know that you still could get in a car accident with a pedestrians but mostly car on car accidents happen. the less cars on the road the less accidents.

Conclusion, Limiting on car usage has its advantages. my three reasons were you spend less money, less traffic and less car accidents. That was how i explain why limiting on car usage has is advantages.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1

""It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs,"" Luke says, you can help countries that are in ruins after World War II. You get to take care for horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. It is a huge responsibility, but it is worth doing. You get to feed the animals, which is like going to a petting zoo for free, besides all the work. You also get to travel to places while you are at a certain country. I wouldn't think it is so easy, because you have to do a lot of work it is harder than it sounds, but you are doing it for a good purpose. It is certainly a great opportunity to help animals get good care and to travel to other countries. I would love the sight seeing and feeding the animals.

"I believe that choosing the president of the United States should be choosen by popular vote and not by the Electoral Collage. I believe this way because I think that the people should have the right to choose who represent their country, not the House of Representatives/Senate. The Electoral College in most cases is unfair to most voters because of the whole ""winner-take-all policy"". Some states have less electoral votes given to them and that may seem unfair to some. The Electoral College method is basically electors that elect the president and not the people which I think is completely useless.

I believe that the best argument should be between the people and not members of the Electoral College. The most worrying part of using the Electoral College to vote for the president and vice president insteded of using the peoples votes is that the elections are just being thrown to the House of Representatives, where the state delegates choose the president and the Senate will choose the vice president. Candidates dont't spend time in states they know will have no chance of winning. they only focus on the tight races in ""swing states"" that are most likely to pay closes attention to the campaign. The Electoral College puts most of the weight on the large states because of their large populations.

Getting rid of the Electoral College is a better decison for the people so they get a say in how they want their county to be and not how the goverment wants the country to be. If we use the peoples vote we would get more accurate votes and it would be fair for everyone. The Electorlal College is pretty much what the government wants rather than what the people want which is why many citizens have problems with our current president, so if the people could just get a say in who they think should run the country they should. When we vote for a presidential candidate we are actually voting for a slate of electors and not for the president. Some of the smaller states don't get to see any campaign ads like the larger states do so they are basically putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters.

The Electoral College is hurting our county because we are not getting the accurate votes we think we're getting. Citizens are not going to want to vote anymore because of how unfair these campaigns are. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an election.",2,4,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Car free cities can have a advantage due to being able to get from point A to point B without causing any harm to the enviroment, but the price is risky to have a car, in some countries, your better without a car. Such as in ""In German suburb, life goes on without cars""By Elisabeth Rosenthal. And in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". By Robert Duffer.

German residents in VAUBAN are know as ""suburb pioneers"" because of them not having any motor vehicles. An additional affect is that in order to put your car in a parking garage it will cost you an additional $40,000 along with a house. Another in paris ""almost 4,000 drivers were fined for 22-euro $31 U.S dollars, 27 people had there cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"". An extra effect was that  the city had ""cold nights and warm days causing the warmer layer of air to trap car emission"".

""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" This quote shows that alert drivers would be the best for our safety, but the drivers not alert or under the influence of something could cause serious damage to someone or something which is why the car should have a setting for the human to drive and one setting for the car to drive.

"Dear state senator i am in favor of the

Electoral College .The

Electoral Collage the process,not a place Founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between elections of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by the popular vote of qualified citizens.

Electoral Collage consis of the selection of the electors where they vote for president and vice presidence,and the counting of the electoral votes by the congress. The

Electoral Collage consis of the 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to select the president. Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the

Electoral Collage .Each canidate running for president in our state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by the canidates political party,but states laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

President election is held every few hours on tuesday after the first monday in november. You help choose our states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote canidate you are actually voting for your canidates electors. After the presidential election your governor prepares a certificate of ascertainment listing all the candidates who ran for presidenty in your stare along with the names of their respective electors. The certificate of ascertainment declares who the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent. Your state certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress and the national archives as part of the official recors of the president election.

Why people think the

Electoral collage is wrong? Because over 60% percent of the voter would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This year the voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. Whats the bad thing about the

Electoral collage is that voters vote not for the president, but for a slate electors,who in turn elect the president. Peaple dissagre with the

Electoral collage do to the fact is is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all system in each state,canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. Those are mostly the main reason why the people do not want the

Ellectoal collage to continue they want to be the one who choose who is winning.

I agree with the

Electoral collage and think it should continue with it. I think the president and the congress ahould continue to decide who is the winner they got more expirience and know who will be the best person to continue with it and win the

"The 1900's  was much different then it is now. For example new technology and new discoveries.  What else has changed is wether to keep the electoral college or not.  The Electoral College is a big part in our government and plays a big part in wether who will be our next president.

According to the passage""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral college is a process, not a place. This means that it is not in a certain place it is all over the United States.  The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualififed citizens.  The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

Admittedly, I feel that we should keep the Electoral College because it will help us with the voting process.  According to the passage"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer he states that under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president.  As a result I feel that this isnt much of an issue for us citizens because if you make the right choice then they will vote for your president.  So if you think about it there really isnt much of an issue because your president will still have your vote. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a non-democartic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner.

Proceeding further, the Electoral College is based of the electors you pick and then they decide of who becomes president by the popular vote.  When you are voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors.  Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee.

In conclusion, the electoral college is about voting for electors and then they become president if enough popular votes are met.  Some people like this  method and then some of the people dont.  We all have our opinion by mine is i like this method.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Imagen being a cowboy but not on land, on sea, taking care of animals and going to many beautiful places. Its called being a Seagoing Cowboy. Sign up right now and help lots of people and have the experience of a life time. You will get to learn about the animals and take care of them, have lots of fun, and experience many unique places.

First of all, you get to take care and learn about the animals there. Some people might not like the fact that you have to stay in a boat several weeks with the animals. But after taking care of them and feeding them its not that bad and they become your friends. I had to feed them and water the animals two or three times a day. The stalls where the horses were kept also had to be cleaned. Not only do you learn to take care of the animals but you also learn responsibility.

Secondly, you have a lot of fun. I get that some people think being stuck in a boat isn't fun at all. Some of the most fun was when the animals were unloaded so the return is one of the funnest parts. The cowboys played many games and sports where the animals were housed. They would have volleyball games, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, all which helped pass time. Go try it, who doesnt like an advanture, and some new friends?

Lastly, you get to experience so many unique places. I understand that some people might not want to leave their home. But, I had the benifit of seeing Europe and China. Another one of the coolest things was the Acropolis in Greece. I got to do many things like taking a gondola ride in Venice, Itay a city with streets of water. I saw many things and went to lots of places just imagen everywhere you could go and everything you would discover if you gave it a chance.

You get to learn about different animals and take care of them, have lots of fun, and experience many unique places. Sign up and have a great time maybe even the time of your life. When you sign up think of all the people your helping. It's a great opportunity after all being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't too bad.",2,3,1,3,1,2,2,1,2

Aliens could not have made this because they do not exist, it would take a long time to make anything that scale, and it would take them years to make.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue they do not exist. This is why NASA thinks this. Aliens would have to have good construction and excavtion equipment. As you would say, they don't need that stuff they just built it. However, there is no physicaly possible way that they could have made it without the equipment.

Aliens could not have made the face because it would take a long time to make anything that scale. Here is why they could not have done it. They don't have the capablities to make anything like the face on Mars. The people that think otherwise would say that it isn't a natural land form. However, NASA scientist where comparing it to other natural landforms. That is why NASA thinks that it is impossible for the aliens to make anything to that scale.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible.

In conclusion, aliens do not exist, do not have cababilatlies to make anything to that scale, and it would take to long that is why aliens could not have made this face. People get their hopes up about things to easily that is why NASA does not think any of this is even near possible. It would be better if NASA told evryone the full truth.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear senate,

I think that we should actually keep the electoral college. There are many reasons why should keep it,for one is that that electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. Another reason we should keep the electoral  college is because it has 538 electors. It also helps the U.S by giving us a president. Those are some of my reasons why we the people should keep the electoral college.

First of all, the reason why we the people should keep the electoral college is because the electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The reason I say this is because we the people need a president and the electoral college helps us get one. The electoral college helps us get a vice president as well because if the president dies or some sort the vice president can take in. The electoral college also helps count the electoral votes by the congress. Those are some ways the electoral college helps us.

Further more,another reason why the electoral college helps the us and the U.S is that we have 538 electors. The reason I say this is because every elector do there job by picking the president that will run for the U.S.It also helps pick out the vice president as well like I said in my first paragraph. That is why we should keep the electoral college. The electors help pick out the president that we need for everyone.

Lastly, the last reason I think we should keep the electoral college is because it helps us by giving us a president that we need. A president can do so much for us like Barack Obama. He did great things to keep this nation secure for the people. Other great president did the same thing back then. Because of the electors from the electoral college. Those electors helped pick a president so we can have one and that is why we need the electoral college.

In Conclusion,so today I talked about why we the people need an electoral college and there are many reasons for it. To sum it all up the reasons we need an electoral college is becasue the electors helps us by picking a president,vice president,and the electoral votes that we need. Another is because we have 538 electors that help pick a president. Last is that they give the U.S a president. So this are some of the reasons why we the people need an electoral college.",2,3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0
"In 1976 a strange humanlike face was found on Mars by NASA's Viking 1. A giant face almost two miles long was thought to be created by aliens. But NASA scientists thought differently.

I believe that the face is a natural ladform as well as NASA. Becsause the NASA scientists proved it was a mesa and that they had no reason to cover up alien life.

The face was found in one of the regions of Mars called Cydonia. Scientists were in shock at first, but they stated that it was a Martian mesa even though a face like structure was seen in the pictures. A couple days afterward the formation was unveiled for the public to see and they went insane over the images.

The conspiracy theroies piled up as some stated that the pictures were perfect evidence of life on Mars. NASA's budget only wished that there was actual life on Mars but knew all to well there was no life on Mars. Only a handful of NASA scientists thought of this as an alien artifact, but getting more pictures of it was a top priority for NASA. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. Thousands of web surfers were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. There wasn't an alien monument. But all it did was reveal a natural landform.

I was thrillled when I read this becuase it proved my hypothesis correct. But there were still some people who werent satisfied by the images. Some people claimed that there was a haze that kept the alien markings hidden. On April 8, 2001 on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. Using the cameras highest resolution it took a picture of the face. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program stated As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, also he said So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

The face on Mars had captivated people's imagination for years. Wheather in a movie, books, magazines, or even in the gossip magazines. Aleins creating face just doesnt seem logical enough for NASA scientists or for me. Throughout this writing I've stated multiple facts and come to the conclusion that the face on Mars was just a natural landform, and not a alien made monument. I hope that you also will come to the same conclusion yourself.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"People are lining up, waiting for hours on end to vote for a new president of the United States. That president won every single person's vote, but did not become presient. He did not become president because the ellectoral college voted for the other person. That is unfair because no matter what the citizens say, they are not even completly sure that the president they voted for was going to win. For example, in the year 2000, a little bit after Al Gore, they won the popular vote, but they did not win the presidency because they did not win the electoral vote, according to Source 2. Citizens of the United States should be allowed to a direct vote because in 2000, 60 percent of voters voted that they prefer a direct election, and because the voters are not voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors.

To begin, according to source 2, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. On the off-chance that those electors won statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes."" This quote from Source 2 is explaining what your vote couts for when you go to elect for a president. Those electors are anyoen who doesn not own a public office. Who elects the electors is the state.

In addition, this year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency and yet, the electoral college still has its defenders, states in source 2.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair to voters, because the winner takes it all system does not work in every state.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Dear Senator,

I think you should get rid of the Electoral College and use poular vote instead. I think this because the Electoral College acts as one. The Electoral College also does not give every state a chance to see who they are voting for. And last, but not least its just confusing.

I think you should use popular vote instead of the Electoral College because the Electoral College votes as a whole. There is not just one person in a state, there are thosands, sometimes millions. Not every single person cast the same vote, not every single person has the same views. If the Electoral College was used than it votes as a unanamyous vote, while there are different political parties within that state.

Another reason the Electoral College should not be used because it does not give evey state a fair chance. The Electoral College does not give every state a fair chance because the presidential canidates only visit the states with the larger amounts of electoral votes or the swing states. If a state doesn't have a large number of votes or isn't a swing state the canidates don't visit as said in source two. The smaller states don't see the canidates as much as the larger states because the Elctoral College makes it seem as though they can only have little if any impact on the outcome of the presidential race.

The final reason reason why the Electoral College should not be use dis because its just so confusing. The popular vote is a lot easier to understand than the Electoral College. Many people get confused during the election days because they do not understand the Electoral College. When they are voting they think they are voting for the President. The Electoral College doesn't mean that you are voting for the President you want, it just means that you're voting for the people who also want to vote for the same President as you.

In conclusion, Senator, these are the reasons why I think that we should use the popular vote instead of the Electoral College. First, the Electoral College votes as a whole instead of showing the a state's differences. Secondly, Presidentail canidates don't visit the states with a smaller amount of electoral votes. And lastly, the Electoral College is just confusing.",3,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I think that we should change to popular vote for president of the United States. Instead of the Electorial College. I think this for a lot of reasons, one is because you dont vote for the president but for the electors. It is unfair because they have a winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to decide. Electers can defy the will of the people. The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president.

First, you have to vote for the electors not the president. Then only if they win there votes go through. You can't even control who the electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused on who there voting for and vote for the wrong elector. Over sixty percent of voters would prefer a direct election than what we have now.

Then, they have the winner takes all system. Also candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. Seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all. states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even see a campain ad. Though they established electorial college in the constituition Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, agreed on abolishing the electorial college.

Lastly, electers can defy the will of the people. The state legislatures are resposible for picking the electors. If there is a tie between the electors then the state gets to decide. Richard Nixon was presiding over the senate he then validated only his opponent's electors. He made sure to do so without establishing a precedent. What if this possibly happens again?

The electorial college should be changed to popular vote for the president. This should be done because the electorial college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. You also dont vote for the president you vote for the electors. Its also unfair because of the winner takes all system. Also if there is a tie the state gets to vote for the president. The electorial college should be changed to the popular vote for the president, because the electors can defy the will of the people.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Technology has come a long way to create a Facial Action Coding System. This system can make it easier for a lot of people to figure out what emotions people are feeling. Putting this technology in schools would make it easier for teacher to understand how students are feeling about their lessons. The Facial Coding System would be a great idea to put on school computers to find out what the students are feeling.

Making technology like this is very advanced and clever. Many students want to be nice to their teacher when they ask if they like the lessons. Putting this technology while they are teaching the lessons would be a good idea for how the students actually feel. There would probably be some cons with this technology though. The students could be thinking of something else or being distracted while it is scanning their face. making the scan inaccurate because they're not reacting to the teache they are reacting to something that happened earlier that day or soemthing else on their computer. Although the technology would have a lot of pros. Scanning their faces when they are paying attention could be very helpful. Teacher could learn to make their lessons more interesting with this technology. Knowing if the student are happy during a lessing could make the teacher do more of what she was doing. Also using this technology could help teachers understand if their students aren't feeling well during their class period. This could be helpful for teacher because pople never want accidents in the classroom. Using this technology could helo teacher recognizze when students are nervouse or anxious to help them calm down and be more relaxed in the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System is a great new tool for teacher to use in the classroom. Teachers always need new ideas for teaching new information to a classroom. Using this technology would make it a lot easier to understand the students. Teachers often forget about the feelings of their students. This is a great reminder of the information that they're giving their student is important for the students to understand and comprehend. Reading students' expressions would be a great idea for the classroom.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"I think that driveless cars should not be allowed in the U.S becuse, they can be a danger to the citicens, or people on this planet or they might start messing up and might cost a lot of money to repair.

First I think that driveless cars should not be allowed because they can be a danger to the people of america, they can develop a mind of their own or they ,ight cost too much money to fix or mechanics may not be able to fix them, they weren't trained to do those type of cars.

Another reason, is that companies might stp making that much gas because we would have robotic cars and they might not run on gas so companies might not make that much money so they might slow down on producing gas and it would just cause a lot of problems.

Also, why driveless cars should not be allowed is because what if thr robotic driver and a human get into a car accident the judge or whoever is handlling the case wouldnt know who to believe so probably the human would be at fault most likely.",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"A student is sitting in his seat alternating his facial expressions from a frown to a smile every other minute. The student is not necessarily happy, sad, or pocessing mixed emotions, but simply playing around and testing the new technolgy that has been placed in the classroom. New technology has been developed that can detect facial expressions. Dr. Hang predicts, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored."" What he doesn't stop to think about is wether this technology would be distracting, or bring other negative effects to the students. The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, put forth false information leading to personal problems, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn.

First, the use of technology that can calculate facial expressions would be a distraction to the students and the teacher in a classroom. Technology such as telephones, iPods, and smart watches have been banned in the classroom at most schools. This is beacuse they are a distraction to learning. Imagine a high technical computer that monitors all of 44 major muscles of your face to decect the percent ratio of the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness placed in a classroom of students from the ages five to eighteen. This would lead to a lot of distraction beacuse most students at this age would be curious of how it works, and if it works. Instead of listening to the lesson, the students would be messing around and trying out different facial expressions. This technology can also be distracting to the teacher beacuse they will have to be worrying about how their expressions are as well. They will be focusing on not looking negative, or being to harsh on the student since they are now being watched. This may ause them to not be as honest on feedback, and they may not be as focused on teaching.

Next, the technology in the classroom can put forth false information and casue personal problems. The technology can read, as previously mentioned the percent of how much anger, fear, and sadness you pocess. Many students at this age are going through a lot of changes and have many mixed emotions. For example, if the technology detects a particular student contains a large amount of sadness, fear, and anger for so many days, the student's parents should be notified because they could have emotional or mental issues. Though the technology seems very well designed, sometimes our facial expressions contradict our actual emotions. The technology can put forth false information of how we are feeling, and cause serious personal problems. Some people may believe the use of this technology in the classroom is beneficial becasue it monitors when students seem uniterested or bored, but a teacher can do such on their own, and all the many problems the technology gives is not worth it.

Finally, the technology can be a problem in the classroom beacuse it may cause students to feel uncomfortable. Many students struggle with their presentation skills at this age beacuse they may feel insecure or pressured, knowing that people are watching them. With this technolgy watching their every move and expression changes, it may cause them the same kind of pressure. This can lead them to not want to participate in class. In school the best way a teacher knows if you understand the material is if you ask questions, answer, and are involved. If this techology stops them from that, then it should not be in the classroom. In most schools, cameras are not allowed in the classroom, so that rule should be applied to this use of technology as well.

The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, malfunction and put forth false information, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn. In conclusion, the technology would bring a lot of problems to the students and teachers in the classroom. If there is only one good reason against many reasons not to have or do something then, it is usually not worth it. That rule applies here. Facial recogniotion technology should not be in a classroom beacuse it is uneccessary and brings neagtive effects to the students and teachers.",5,4,3,4,1,2,3,3,2
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author makes very valid points on why people should support cars that drive themselves or why people should not support these driverless cars. I am in favor of this idea of a driverless car.

Companies that are making computer-driven cars have come along way until now. These companies have taken so many safety percaussions to insure that the driver will be safe all of the time. The article says that the car will alert the driver to take over ""when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" Google has inserted sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor. The driverless google also includes a spinning sensor on the rooof. Telling by the example I just gave, Google wants the car to be safe and cautious but it is more important on focusing on the driver and passangers safety. Improvements in sensors and computer harder keep growing further and further, this makes driving safer and it is closer to having a driverless car.

Although, a driverless car has not been fully proved to work yet, safety is the most important aspect of making a driverless car. "" GM (General Motors) has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays."" These companies are in favor of the driver's best interest.

Do not think that the driver wil totally not be in control, because they will be in control. In the year of 2013, BMW annound that they have developed what is called a ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" The ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" can handle driving functions of speeds up to 25 miles per hour. The car is just driving but the person does have control of the car whenever they want too. Google also has cars that have driven more than half a million miles without a single crash. And if a crash does indeed happen then it could possible not be the car or the manufactors fault, it could be the drivers or the condition of the road. Many futurists belived that maybe the reason that driverless cars couldn't be created was because of the roads now. ""General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car."" Engineers at Berkeley University tried the same thing but using magnets with alternating polarity.

In conclusion, driverless cars have not been fully invented but should have been given the chance to be driven. So many positives can come out of a driverless car. Safety is the main problem with this car in my opnion but give the companies some time to come out with the perfect autonomous car.",3,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Venus points of danger.

Venus can't be explored since everything that we caused to go there haven't made it since the surface is burning hot at around 800 fahrenheit which can burn many of our technology.Not even space crafts that we sent out wouldn't be able to survive on there planet since it is 800 degrees fahrenhiet which means most of our current technology aren't suitable for this kind of absured planet that we are not used to by anyway shape or form. We can't even make experimental work on it instantly since it could be burning us and our transportation there in a second or

if we're lucky over a minute.

Our technology isn't suitable for this kind of heat and not used to this planet since no body has every took a step on this planet since it could horrificly burn us alive in a matter of seconds.The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide which is nothing to our used to planet and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times as greater than what we experianced. Could burn us in matter of seconds and liquefy many of our materials now and has a hotter surface than any of our other planets that we have ever known in our solar system so we have less information and not a good amount of time for being in the planet.

Rocky surface include valley's , mountains and craters which is worse for the quality of the surface and us landing on it would be terrable because, even from thirty or more miles away from the planet it would be 170 degrees fahrenhiet which it almost double of what earth has for summer which could almost make us faint,passout and have a heat stroke. Researchers can not take items away from the planet since the heat is to strong and we have no technology to surpass the heat it contains. We simulated choas of venus surface and have tested for three weeks in such coditions.

The gears we have will not require electronics at all which will be hard for us to discover and research on when we can't see even in a peek of communication . A lack of communication for everyone and can't be able to find more information about it if no one could describe it face to face.Many natrual disasters would be involved as well since it has eruption volcanoes and frequent lighting strikes to the point where that planet is hard and unsafe to investagte but, some do still since the investigation will help everyone in the world to figure out how much stuff or things it could do when something happends to it which hopefully nothing does since it safer than veus that could be our second planet to have life there in the future.

Large body of waters is in the planet and it could be terrible surfaceses and form. Oceans could effect the natrual disasters and could enworsing it since the water could have a huge impact and a have a huge part of the disasters. Could be surivale to some humans since it is like our home and planet but, just another planet and it has alot of simularites as earth and could maybe be our next planet to live on just incase something happens but, we should first experiment and have a good amout of information about this hot planet before anybody takes a step into the planet which is highly risky to take a step since all of the natrual disasters are huge and are able to kill any human being who has habitat on venus.",3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So you think Aliens created this historical peace of fiction. Aliens would seem like a good idea but wheres the evidence? People come up with these therories and cant support them in the way the were ment to be supported. These pictures we got from Mars are not just supported but we got the pictures with our satelite.

We scientist over in NASA are trying to find ways to expand human nature. People keep saying Aliens did this and thats making us want to explore this more even though the theory can't be supported. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to find these answers to lifes mysteries.

We even supported this in with facts about water on Mars and the mini volcanoes. The landform was a coquencedence that it was caught by our cameras and the fact about it is if this landform happened by aliens wouldn't the camera caught it? The face was first saw in 1976 and it looked like a wave of water splashed over it and dried. The volcanoes could have also erupted and hardened so the landform would have to have been there to heating and cooling of molten lava.

Even though the alien evidence can be proven it still is in the picture. The landform could have been a sign that the aliens put out and wanted help. It could have also been a sign for what is to come. The alien therory isnt well thought out, but in life anything can happen.

"In our society today, car usage is extremly high. It would be best for our world if we can limit car usage due to pullution and all of the warning wwe have been recieving about the earth becoming an inhabitat planet. As a society we should really crack down on driving our cars alot to avoid our planet from becoming pulluted.

Cars can really be a expensive pay when it comes to violations. Paris has been really looking into their car industry. According to Reuters, almost 4,000 drivers were fined for having even number license plates. Some were ordered to leave their car homes or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). Many people had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. This would apply to vehicles with odd numbered plates the following day. This all happen after days of an near record passing pullution. Paying violation fines can really side track your expenses, especiallly major violations.

Cars can really cause a bad case of pullution. When your running your car all the gas is being put into the air. According to Paris bans driving due to smog by, Robert Duffer, he stated that diesel fuel was blamed, since France had a tax policy that suggested diesel over gasoline. According to Reuters Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe. The cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Paris usually has more smog than other European capitals. Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of PM compared with Brussels 114 and London's 79.7. According to BBC public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. The delivery companies complained for their lost revenue.

Crazy right? But is that the most effective way to this and if it is not the why shouldnt we chage it to something more fare and equal and not leave it up to some special elecorss. Leave it to the people to decide who we want for our president.

The United Staes is a fairly new country compared to others around our world yet we have some pretty advanced technologies and some really brilent ideas but when our founding fathers made the Constitution I dont think they made the best choice. Even some of our previous presidents like Nixon, Carter, Dole, Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have said we need a better way to elect our presidents. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote and was set on presidence but did not win thanks to this outragious system and lost the electoral vote and lost his shot at precendence. If you win the popular vote doesnt that mean your the fan favorate and the citezens want you to be president because the majority voted for you. During a pole shortly after Gore lost people were asked if we should keep the system we have now or chang and 60% of the people asked said that we should change. Cant you see the people are cying our for help and asking to change the system so someone like Gore doesnt get cheater again.

When campaining as a president shouldnt you try to visit every state to try and increase yo popularity? Well sadly it really doesnt work like that with this current system you see some presidents lets take Obama and Romney as and example. Some staes wont see the canidates at all because they ""know"" they will win the electoral votes. Obama in the 2012 election never visited some staes like Ohio or Romney and flordia because they knew that the majorety would vote for him and he would win that state. Now how is that fair. If it was up to just a popularity vote each president campaining would go to every stae trying to get as many voters as possible instead they say eh i will skip that state because I will get the majorety any ways. On top of the the electoral system makes smaller states less important because it is set up where more population means more votes. That to me is saying well you a small state so everyone in that stae you mean way less that this other state. California, Texas, and Flordia are the most campianed staes in the US because they have 55,38,29 votes respectivley. now places like Arizona, Ohio, north and south Dakota have six, three, three, and three respectivley. how is any of these people less important adn less aluable the the ones in California, Texas or Flordia.

I still cant find a reason why we should keep this sytem around and the more I think about it the more I want to get rid of it. The electoral college is taking our power as US citezens our of our hands and defies us from voting for the president and in turn makes us vote for special offece people. I say leave the electoral system and change to a popular vote wins presedency. This puts power where it should belong, in the hands of the citizens. Who else is with me on abanding the old way and taking a new step in the direction of power to the people.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,2,1
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explaines all the dangers of Venus and how to over come them. He gives you good evidence on how you could explore our sister planet without suffering the harsh weather of Venus's surface. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and it may have even had large oceans long ago, but today Venus's surface is inhospitable for humans.

The author states that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus is no longer Earth-like, its surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times the pressure we experiance on Earth. And with that, there are many other factors making Venus inhabitable for humans. The author did offer a solution to these dangers, which would allow the scientists to float above the dangers. NASA said they would take a ""...blimp-like vehical [that hovers] 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" It would make the conditions survivable for humans, but how much research could you do on the planet when you're 30 miles above the surface? The author goes on and writes that researchers are working on machines that could possibly go in the ground of Venus and collect data about the surface,and could return it to the scientists for them to study.

The author of

""The Challenges of Exploring Venus,"" supports their idea that studying Venus is worth the risks. They take in account all the dangers Venus has to offer, and they come up with a solution that would make the planet explorable.",2,3,3,2,1,2,2,2,2

"I personally think that we should work to achieve the goal of driverless cars. If we were to have driverless cars, there would be far less traffic accidents. There would be no reason to need to get a speeding ticket and it would save the mojourity of people a significate amount of money. Like it said in the passage it would half the fuel needed. I agree with their argument accept for the fact that the passage stated that it should be only puplic transportation.

The fact that google has a car that is opperated by a computer most of the time shows that we are well on our way to achiving the goal of driverless vehicals. Even though there are times that you have to drive yourself, it is very close.

The problem with having autonomous vehicals is that they would not have the same capibalities as a person. The are times that ther are paths or roads are not able to be driven except by a person. If the road is badly damaged, you can't drive normally or you will have the risk of damaging your car and needing alot of money to repair it.

In conclusion, I think that we should further advance towards the goal of driverless vehicals but keep the availabillty to give the driver a choice if they want to drive themselves.",1,2,2,3,0,1,2,3,1
"You may believe that the face that you see on mars has been created by some other living thing or aliens, but it is nothing more than a natural land mass. The shadows casted on the mass makes it look like a face staring back at you, It seems to be quite menacing.

If you get closer to the mass of land you can see that is nothing more thann a 2 mile wide hill calles a mesa. you can find these on earth even, for insance in Middle Butte In the state of Idaho. This fact proving that it is nothing but a coincedence. From a distance the 1971 viking photo did look as if it was definately a face.

When this image was released everyon at NASA was shocked. They couldn't believe what they were seeing, then later we sent out a new spacecraft with a higher resolution than the old one. It proved that this mystery face was just a hoax. Some might wish that we would have found a secret civilization on Mars but those wishes won't come true.

As we develop more high-tech devices, cameras, and space crafts, We learn that everthing is not what is seems to be. Our newer cameras have about triple the resolution with each pixel spaning at 1.56 meters, while in the original viking photo the pixes are bigger with a span of 43 meters.

Your brain can play tricks on you, making things seem different to what they really are. these are called optican illusions. Don't let your mind trick you go with your gut feeling and choose the side that sounds more realistic to you. do you really think that aliens exist and could build something of those porportions?",2,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Luke should use these reason's to convince other people. The program helps with people in need, people around the world that need supplies, and livestock. The Seagoing Coyboys program is a program for helping other's.

The first reason is the program helps with people in need. Luke and Don go help people and sign up for program. Example-

Luke helped Katie's farm for checking the animals every night. Then he slipped and cracked his ribs so he coudn't work for a couple days. He also took care of cattle while on board.

The second reason is Luke going around the world. He went to many parts of Europe. In Greece he got drafted with the military. He went to China to help animals with crossings. In the Pacific and atlantic ocean he took care of animals, while going to Europe. There were alot things to do.

The last reason is Luke going around and giving supplies. In the first paragraph he worked a two- part job. Then when going to Europe he gave cattle to people or farmers. He probably gave them food and water. The reason is because is the end of WWII and buildings are down.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a program for helping others. To sum marize the reasons. The program helps with people in need, the program goes around the world, and the program helps with livestock and supplies. Luke did a great thing to help with the world.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The ""Face of Mars"" was not created by aliens. The ""face"" is a mesa, an elevated piece of land similar to a plateau. The mesa is about 2 miles long, and the face is created by the shadows from protruding rock. The features of this landform could have been created by aliens if they had the ability to carve a two mile long mesa to look like a face, not knowing what it looked like while they were carving it. Since they were on the ground they we we carving, they would have had to either cut into the rock blindly, or have a method to see what the face looked like. That method, be it mechanical or optical should still be visible. The aliens might not be humanoid, and might not know what a human face looked like. They wouldn't be able to cut out an image of something if they don't know what it looks like. Even if aliens could cut a face into the rock, there would be fragments of that rock lying all around the base of the landform. Most of the debris might be swept away over time, but there would still be some. If the carving was done by aliens, they would have to have some way to get on top of the mesa, and that might be visible. It could be stairs, or a ladder, or a rope, but it should be visible to the satellite pictures. If the aliens did cut the face into the mesa, then it they would have gone about it in a different way. Assuming that the aliens created the face is assuming that they are intelligent beings. Intelligent beings would most likely have created finer details or carved a symbol or word to show who created the face. If they are unintelligent beings, how did they get on top of the mesa and how did they cut out the face.",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3

"Cars have been used for a very long time now and are a revolutionary invention that completely changed the way humans lived, since it became easier to move from one place to another and increase the size of our cities and mobility in general. Automobiles have alwayas been extremly useful and necesary to our society, however, it had too, some significant disadvantages that could have great impact on our lives. Having this clear now we can point ouit tghe advantages of limiting the car usage no matter how hard or difficult it might be to the biggest cities or more developed societies.

It is important to notice an experiment that was conducted in Germany, the city of Vauban was finished in 2006 and it is an example of a ""car-free"" environment with a few exceptions such as the main street and borders, acording to Elizabeth Rosenthal in her article: ""In German Suburbs, Life Goes On Without Cars"". In the passage it is explained how people gave up a certain lifesctyle to participate in this new progect and it proves how limiting the usage of car can create a very succesful and less stresful future. 70% of the population of this city do not own cars, one of them, Heidrum Walter said: ""When I had a car I was aleays tense, I'm much happier this way,"" proving again how advantagous is this experiment.

In the other had, there is France's capital; Paris, which banned driving due to smog. ""Diesel fuel was blamed"" expressed Robert Duffer on his atricle, additionally refering to its use which makes up 67% of the vehicles in France. As a resulf of the fines and free public transpartation on business days the smog cleared enough so part of the ban was rescinded. Another example of the advantages of reducing car usage is how ""its a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" added Carlos A. Plaza, a colombian participating in the car-free day that takes place in Bogota every year. This event motivates people not just in the Colombian capital to ride bikes and be healthier but everyone around them, including adjacent southamerican countries. For instance, stadistics talk too, and it is possible that America getting over its obsession with cars, which is amazing news due to the fact that mobiles vehicles represent the second largest source of carbon emissions in America, as discused on ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal.

All in all, limiting car usage - although a difficul decision for most residents of develeped first-worls countries - might just be one of the greatest steps we could take towards helping our envirionment and forging a new society, shaping it a better way, building healthier kids that will excersice and ejoy more the outsides, and that will breathe cleaner, fresher air. We can improve our atmosphere's condition refereing to greenhouse gasses and carbon emissions and in addition, lead out economy a different direction, maybe to a better, improved world and society that does not depend on mechanic vehicles.",3,3,2,3,0,1,2,2,0
"Driverless cars should not be allowed on the roads proven by examples and facts in this writing.

One reason driverless cars should not be allowed is because you would still have to be alert just in case the car needs human assistance. That is the whole reason behind driverless cars so that people won't need to pay attention the vechile will do it for them. If the driver were to not be paying atttention and the vechile needed assistance because of road construction or traffic and the driver were to be not paying atttention it could cause a serious accident. Similar to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" in paragraph 2 it says how the car would need an alert driver to take over if there were traffic issues, roadwork, or accidents.

Another is that if there were an accident the manufacturer would not be held reliable the driver would be. In paragraph 9 it said how most states will not even let them test computer-driven cars because the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver.

Although automakers are still working assuming the problems ahead will be solved, but many think it is a big stretch working on this. Many may not believe that it is not worth the money continuing to make a driverless car.

As a conclusion driverless cars should not be allowed on the road because of reliability issues and the need the cars have for an alert driver.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,2,1
"Well in my favor I would have the Electoral College reason why is because it keeps all the votes for the presidential election and etc. And each or any electors in your state has his or her own group of electors. And the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party , but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what is their responsibilities are. But the Electoral College it consists or has 538 electors but the majority is to have 270 s that you can vote for the president. By the way once you have voted for the president or senate or governer etc. The system will count how many popular votes or from a vote from Congress and the qualified citizens. But my reason for the electoral college to stay is that once you have voted you can count from the system or it does it for you but if you dont want the electoral college then it will take alot longer for the votes to be process and be accumilated.

Well so there's people or citizen that want the electoral college to keep going but some don't reason to that is in the story this is what it says, ""The electoral college  is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostky assertins withoout much basis in reality"". And its unfair cause it has the winner take all system in each state. And they sometimes have problems getting the votes from some states and they couldn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and South Carolina and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. And the story says from someones opinion ""And the arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality."" And once a state has voten it  counts as 1 vote.

And some people and the people from the government or like congress,senators,representatives, and more hope that one day while they are voting that the score or number of votes is not a tie. But some citizens arn't into the technology of the electoral vote or how it works. But in that case I would like to not want the electoral collge to keep going mostly due to unfairness, outdated,irrational.

Since the electoral college is still working the method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state-- Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. But of course no voter's vote swings a national elction, and in spite of that, about one-half the eligible  American popluation did vote in 2012's election.",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example in paragraph 7, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus’s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II.

"Cars play a huge role in our lives. It is the most easy and common way of transportation. In some parts of the U.S.,you can drive a car even if you're 15. Before cars weren't invented,people used bicycles,subways,roller skates,busses....

If you want to go to somewhere by bike,it is gonna take much more time than it takes by car. That's why people prefer driving cars insted of riding bikes or using subway. However,there are some disadventages of driving car. Air pollution is one of them. Our world is getting dirtier every day and it's under risk. The glaciers are melting and the animals who live in the north pole are dying. The people who are aware of this,don't drive cars and protest it. In the article""In German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"", Elisabeth Rosenthal says ""Street parking,driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg,near the French and Swiss borders.

"There is many wys a diverless car could be good and bad.

I willl be viewing how it can be good, bad, and my thoughts about driverless cars.

There is a big change that might happen about cars driving themselves to get us and take us to placeswe need to be.

Theres many ways a driverless car can support the driver.

One way it can support the driver is if the driver is very tired, the driver can sleep as the car takes them to where they need to go.

That helps the dangers of falling asleep behind the wheel.

Another way it helps the driver is if the driver is injured and cant drive.

It will help them by getting them to where they need to go with no pain.

There is good and supporting ways a driverless car can be useful.

There is many ways a driverless car can be bad.

One of the ways it can be bad is if we have driverless cars soon the young kids wont need to learn to drive, untill you have to drive the car because somthing goes wrong.

So the problem is what happens when a person behind the wheel doesnt have a license?

Does it danger the other drivers aswell?

Another point is what if the car wrecks, how do we know whos fault it is? The driver or the driverless car?

I think that our world shouldn'thave driverless cars.

I say that because I think it will put our lives at a greater rish than they are now operating a car.

What will hapen if we get hurt while the driverless car is in control?

Theres way too many questions about this type of change that makes me not agree with it.

I can see some ways it can support people but I see those people as lazy.

How will the car know where to pick you up from?

I understand how auto breaks and alerts help us but i just don't see driverless cars becoming a thing.

I have shared the good, bad, and my thought about driverless cars.

There is many ways it supports and many ways it doesn't.

How much change will happen?

Do you think driverless car will help or hurt our world?",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Automakers are progressing closer and closer to bringing fantasy and reality together by creating the driverless car. Many people debate whether they should be legal, or if they even have any real use to the world. The driverless car is not a practical option for the world to turn to.

To allow technology to completely overrun our lives and to go on ""auto-pilot"" for the rest of one's life, would do much more harm than good. The driverless car will allow drivers to essentially ignore the road and their surroundings during their trip. Though the manufacturers may warn consumers to be alert during their ride, one must find it pointless to pay for an automatic car, when they may have a normal car that requires a slightly higher level of attention. One must fear that for going on ""auto-pilot"" for so long, the people may forget how to drive properly.

When these cars get in an accident, there will be a law suit between the driver and the manufacturer. If the car gets in an accident caused by the car itself, then the manufacturer will have ""wrecked"" it's reputation, and hopefully will be forced to recall every autonomous car of that model, which would be extremely expensive fpr the company to do. To add to that, these cars will be far too expensive for consumers to be worth all of the legal and insurance hassle that would be attached to it.

Finally, one should find that the automatic car would disconnect their emotional connection to their normal car. Tthe automatic car takes the fun out of driving, making the task seem to be a mundane way to get from point A to point B. The automatic car would steal one's confidence in having control over where their going, which also means drivers would do less ""taking the long way home"" and more ""get me to where I'm going"".

In conclusion, the automatic car is not going to become the future of driving. In American society, people have emotional relationships with their cars, and the automatic car would not fill in that gap. For the people that would go for the automatic car would become unaware of their surroundings, and frankly would be set on auto-pilot for so long, that one fears that they may forget how to drive properly. In the end, the automatic car may be good to some, but inpractical and inflexibole to many, but no one knows what the future may hold",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Having different technology helps people. People like it, it can be helpful in many different ways. For example, if a person can't speak their is a techonolgy that helps people that don't have to have a voice with a computer. Techonolgy is useful in many different ways. The use of the technology in the article Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D' Alto would be really vaulable.

The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad says the author. Examples that they use when a computer can tell if you are happy or sad is if you smile when a web ad apperas on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But, if you frown, the next ad will be different. That would be great because if you are watching something and then all of a sudden an ad comes on and you can't skip it, you want it to be entertaining and fun and not boring and dumb. It would also be very helpful if you are at school. ""A classom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lessson, like an effective human instructor"" that would be really helpful for some people. Just, in case somone dosen't want to speak up if they are confused the commputer will know right away.

There's also other examples for this. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for the videogames which would become more fun for the person playing the videogame or video surgery. Dr. Huang also says ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too.""

I would think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable. By, the way it works and the way it could help in many different ways. In this passage it wants us to understand that a new technology could be coming soon, in which it could help in many different ways.",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The Face was discovered forty years ago by scientists at NASA who saw the FAce for the first time and said it was a martian mesa. Later when the photo was released to the public conspiracy theorists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but the picture was taken on an older camera on the Viking I that the photo was fuzzy and no one could be sure of what was on the Face. Twenty-two years later another photo was taken with a camera ten times sharper than the original viking I photo. Still some people believed it was an alien artifact and the clouds on mars covered some alien markings that may have been covered by haze.

Others questioned theorists about why NASA would want to hide something like that and how it would benefit scientists at NASA.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to the international news agency(Reuters). Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,after five -days of intsensifying somg. Diesel fuel was blammed, since France has a tax policy theat favors diesel over gasoline. Paris typically ahs more smog than other European capitals. Las week Paris had 147 microgramsof particulate matter. Public transit was free of charge from Friday to Monday. The somg cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party rescined the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday.

Last, Recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licensices as each year goes by. That has left researchers pondering a fundamental question ""Has America passed the peak of driving?"" America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. The United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter. As of April 2013, the number of mile driven per person was nearrly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in the year 1995.

Inconclusion all of the less car usage is being used all across the globe. Things like this are good to keep up.",1,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"I am against driverless cars. I feel this way because they will cost to much, there would be loss in jobs in the bmv, and if it cant get around roadblocks then why whould they be a good option.

Firstly the cost of driverless cars would be greater than normal cars now with all of the maitenence and the cost of aquaring the car. If something were to go wrong you would need to go to someone who specilizes in those types of cars. All of the high-tech gadgets in the car would cost way to much to replace. ot only the cost but what about the people who make a living off of making normal cars.

Secondly there are millions of people around the world that rely on making, and maintaning cars that would be put out of enployment because they wouldn't know how to get all of the gear into the car let alone up keeping them. Also people who make a living on making sure people know how to drive a car would be or of a job because no one would be interested in driving the would just let the car do it for them. The cars wouldn't be able to manuver around rodeblocks and accidents so whats the use for a car that doesn't know how to manuver around natural events.

Finaly natural occurences will happen and us as motorisses would need to know how to manuver around them. Imagen you're driving down a country road

at night when all of the sudden boom a deer walks out onto the road; its already

hard enough to avoid a deer when us as people are driving and even then we reduse our speed greatly when it happens so if we were to hit that deer the inpact wouldn't be that dangorous. What would the car do keep going at the same speed? If it does that one dear could kill who knows how many people in the car along with destroying the tech that comes along with it. Another situation would be what if there is a natural disaster like a hurricane and the city or town is evacuating; now lets say that there was a crash along the way and the cars don't know how to get around it, but nether do the people driving because they have relied on the cars to do the driving; no one would be able to escape the city before the hurricane because they had developed a relience on the cars.

These reasons are why I personaly thing that driverless cars should be kept in hollywood and in books because: the cost would be to high, jobs would be lost in manufactoring and upkeeping of the cars, and if the cars couldn't get around an accident or construction what good would it be.",3,3,1,3,0,0,1,1,0
"The Facial Action Coding System is a coding program that can read emotions, some say this could help in the classroom to tell if students are ingaged in the lesson. This system was created by Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe, leaders in their fields of expertise.

The usage of the Facial Action Coding System in schools to determine if a student is getting bored, tired, or angry at a lesson could be very useful. If a student were to get angry or bored during a lesson they are more likely to not pay attention and if you are tired you may not retain the information as well. If your computer could sense this and alert the teacher or change the lesson accordingly then it would give students a better working enviroment and a better chance of doing well in school. This 3D construct could also help teacher's understand their students better and help them learn more efficiently. This can also see through a fake smile and know the students real emotions which is important in case the student is trying to fake it through the leason when they really need help. According the the professional Dr. Huang, he predicts that, ""A classroom somputor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

So in conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can read emotions and see the real emotions present. This could lead ot improvements in the classroom so that teachers and the computor can alter the lesson as needed to the specfic student and their needs. This is a good idea because it will improve the work enviroment created for students.",1,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that exploring and studying Venus must be done despite the dangers. They support this idea by stating how similar Venus is to Earth and that Venus could have been like Earth many years ago. They don't ignore the dangers though.

The author makes a point to mention the dangers of conducting research on Venus with statements like ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" and ""highly corrosive sulfuric acide in Venus's atmosphere."" They still combat this with reasons to continue though with statements about how similar it is to Earth, and that it ""could have supported various forms of life"".

Venus could have supported life forms and we might be able to research them if we were able to get to them. The author brings up computers that are entirely mechanical. these computers could be build to withstand the intense conditions of Venus. It is possable for us to research Venus further but how many lives is that worth? Our Author did a great job at informing us, but they didn't give us enough reason to make it worth the risk to research Venus.",1,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,3
"The author did really well by being specific and being descriptive about Venus. There was a lot of detail which made it long and a little boring. Not everyone wants to read about Venus, but it is a nice planet but when you are being forced to it's not the best choice.

Things that the authro did good on was being very descriptive. Also, gave very many reasons to do a project over Venus. The author was doing very good about giving as many facts as a student would need in order to do a whole project over. They also gave some good detail about how it's been around 3 decades since someone has tried going to Venus. They have an enormous amount of facts.

Something they could improve on is not make it as lengthy. This story would be very helpful if I had a project over Venus but it's a bit long to do anything else with. Granted there are a lot of facts but I would personaly put some opinion in it and make a little paragraph about what you would do if you went to Venus. Make it a tiny bit more interesting if you put something other than just straight facts. I strongly reccomend putting in some opinion in the next story. For example put some opinion on maybe what you think about a certain fact.

This overall was a great story and the author did a great job writing it. There are a few thing I would do different to grab the readers attention and try and keep it. The story doesn't keep my attention but it may to someone that loves since or maybe even Venus, but I'm not that person. Anyways great story overall just a few nit picks I wanted to point out. I can't wait for a new one next year!",1,3,2,3,1,1,1,2,2
"The author does a good job on suppoting why we shold visit Venus. but at the same time he gives some information that makes you think ""why should we do this again.""

In some parts of this article, for example paragraph 7, he gives really good reason and explanations to why we should investigate Venus. But in other parts like paragraph 3 it makes you think and wonder why they are reconsidering going to Venus. Yes going to Venus will give us a lot of information but at what cost. We would waste million, maybe even billion, of dollars trying to get to Venus and even if we did get to it what would happen to the first human to step out. What are the chances of that human making it back on the spaceship alive let alone trying to stay on the planet long enough to get some samples.

As much as scientist would study that planet and as sure as they could or could not be its all a theory. There is no sure way to nsure 100% that humans to go there will get back safely.

In conclusion to the question asked, I don't think the author supported the idea well. He did do a good job of giving us information but just from what he told us thats another reason why we shouldn't go to Venus.",1,2,1,2,0,1,1,2,0
"I believe that having facial recognition technology in a classroom would be beneficial to everyone involved. It would allow for the students to be put back on track if they are distracted or bored. It would also aide the teachers by giving them feedback that they might've never recieved before. Lastly, as a domino effect, it would help the entire world because we would be making the education system for our future a lot better.

Firstly, if we had facial recognition technology in the classrooms, it would allow for our students to recieve a better education. For example, a student is in class one day and a teacher is giving a lecture that they are just not interested in or don't quite understand so that student's mind begins to wander because they are bored. With the facial recognition, that student would be detected as distracted, bored, or even confused so the teacher can make adjustments to the learning space and/or the way that the material is being taught. This technology would help the students who would normally be confused and too shy to say anything, recieve help and better understand what they are having issues with.

Secondly, this facial recognition technology would be very helpful to teachers who would work with it. They would be getting direct feedback from the class without them even having to say anything. If the class is confused, the teacher can work around the confusion and readjust. This would ensure that students achieve the most information possible and would, therefore, make our teachers and the education system a lot better.

Lastly, I believe that the entire world could benefit from this technological advancement. Our world is changing and adavancing technologically very quickly and we have to be able to keep up. As the world gets smarter, we must get smarter with it. Better technology in the classroom means better learning which means even better, smarter pupils. Any technological advancement that makes our future doctors, surgeons, lawyers, etc. smarter then, I believe, must be put into use right away. We would be securing our future as a nation.

To conclude, the implementing of better technology in any form would be very good. Everyone would benefit from this technology in the education system. That is why I believe that it would be very valuable to implement the technology talked about in this essay in the classroom.",3,3,2,3,2,2,3,2,3

"Cons of Driveless Cars

By: Mahogani ......

Imagine that you are driving a smartcar, not having to pay much attention because the car is driving itself. A small group of middleschoolers are crossing the road, since you are not paying attention you hit the smallest child by accident. You are sued for reckless driving and endangerment of minors. That is the possiblilies when you are driving a smartcar, although they are improving the models they are very far from being used in public saftey. Which is why, the development of smart cars are unsafe, too expensice, and cause more confusion on the driver.

Smartcars are not protective of the driver, and those around them. In the article, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigation through work zones and arround accidents."" (7). In other words, the car is controlling the whole driving experience. That could be very dangerous because what if the motion sensor is tampered with. The driver should be paying attention but it only takes a split second for an accident to happen. The text also says, ""Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.""(7). These seem helpful, but the flashing lights could cause medical issues to arise. If a person that has serve seizures, the flashing lights may trigger them to have a seizure. Therefore their body spasm would lead to an accident. Some people may say that ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-- something not avaiable to drivers trying to text with a cell phone.""(8). That may be true, but how will the car know if the driver is texting? Smartcars are not alive, and they will malfunction from time to time. So giving this life or death responsibility to a nonliving object is very unpredictable, and unsafe.

Smartcar advangements are very expensive to continue with very vase options of safety. In the article,"" Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars."" (6). In other words, each smartcar will be sold for two hundred million dollars, when you think about it that is only a fifth of the faction it cost to build this car. They need sponsors to pay for research and development. They also have to test it and start over if it fails the testing. If it is too high not that many people will buy it so the company will be losing money for not being able to make personal gains from it. Most people believe that people will make a way to afford it if they know its abilities. That may be true, but they will have to give them statics to prove that is it safe. But if it is not a high percentage of safety, no one would take that chance of it being in an accident for it.

Smart cars causes confusion for the driver. In the text, "" The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.""(7). In other words, the car drives until a certain point and its up to the driver to know when it transitions out. There are many malfunction that may accure durning that transition process. Some say that the car watches you drive while you focus on the road. That may be very helpful for insurances purpose, but it could cause some issues to the driver. It could be very distracting that the car is showing you how you are driving. It shows up on a little television underneth the radio. Therefore confusing the driver if they happen to look down.

In conclustion, smart cars are not protective, expensice, and causes confusion which is why they should not continue with the development.",4,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,0
"In germany, they are trying to reduce the amount of cars driving by the people. They are improving on there walk ways, and public transportation to make it a better place. However in paris they are complety banding cars and fining people if they take there cars. The air in the city is smoged. In colombia there is a car free day. They either walk, take buses, bikes. The day without cars is a camaign to improve which began in the mid 1990's. The end of the car culture takes about our president Brack Obama's goal. The United States green house gases.

Germany is imporving on there side walks for people to walk instead of taking there cars, either to work, to school, or other places people need to get. Germany is doing a great job. mentioned in paragragh two, in source 1, it says, ""street parking driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg""... they to are forbidding things in there conturies, yes but they are improving on there streets nd providing public transportation to make it better.

70 percent of Vuauban's families do not own cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal mentions in her artical. 57 percent sold there cars to move there. She also says, in paragragh 3 lines 3 and 4, ""when i had a car i was also tense"". People seem to be tense with having cars. 12 percent of greenhouse gas are in Europe, in the United States its up to 50 percent in some areas.

""All of our development since World War II has been centered on cars"" paragragh 7 states. according to David Goldberg, that will change. Paragragh 8, says that New York sububs with spread out homes nd privite garages, were the dream towns of the 1950's.

Was over in Europe many countries wear left ruined or tone apart.

Many animals where stuck with no home or food. The animals had no one , nobody feeder them. UNRRA hired ''seagoing Cowboys'' to take care of the young cows , horses , and mules

That got shipped over sea. Once Don and I heard about UNRRA we wanted to sign up , so we did. We really need more ''Seagoing Cowboys''. The amazing thing about working and helping these animals is seeing the happiness on there face.

Come join Don and I , I'm telling you it is very joyful.

You would get to travel on the boat maybe even see some

Tourist , or maybe you would be able to see the places we are going. Don and I have made some trips to Greece , castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

"Driverless Cars

Driverless cars could change the world for the better. They could make our lives easier and less stressful. Driverless cars could save lives, save time, and save money. These cars would be a great replacement for the manual cars used today. Driverless cars could benefit our society greatly.

This new invention of cars without drivers could save many lives. Each year thousands of citizens die, or are injured due to car accidents. These accidents are caused mainly by drivers. If cars continue to need drivers, many more deaths will result from this horrible choice. The drivers of these vehicles could be drunk, driving illegally without a valid license, texting, or distracted, resulting in car crashes. The possibilities as to why a person driving a car could get into an accident are endless! However, with no unsuitable driver at the wheel, roads all over the world will become much safer. If ,instead of a driver, the car is automated and drives by itself, people could rid the world of unsafe drivers. With these driverless cars, thousands of lives all over the world could be spared.

Driverless cars could save people time. According to paragraph two in the article, Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Less crashes would result in less traffic jams. Without traffic jams, citizens would be able to get to their destination quicker and easier. Driverless cars could also save time by not having to constantly run into blocked roads. Due to the driverless cars being automated and controlled by an automated system, the system will most likely be able to detect the quickest route to the preferred destination. Therefore, driverless cars could be an advantage to us by saving us time.

With the invention of the driverless car, homo sapiens (humans) would be able to save money. The first product of the driverless car is not bound to be cheap, but as time progresses, the cost of this new car will eventually go down. According to paragraph one in the provided article, the driverless cars would use half the fuel of today's cars and would offer far more flexibility than a bus. Gas is a very expensive fuel. However, if citizens were to only need to pay for half of the money they pay for gas today, then they could save a lot of money that could be used for more important investments. Also, the driverless cars could result in less car crashes, which would result in not having to pay for damage repair. Overall, the driverless cars would not only your save life, but your money too.

The driverless cars could benefit our lives. They would be able to not only improve the way people live today, but they would also have the power to save lives, save time, and save money. This new car design could be the exact replacement, for the manual car used today, our society has been looking for. With these cars, students would also be able to focus on their schoolwork more, rather than on passing their driving exam. They could change life as people know it. The driverless cars would fundamentally change the world for the better.",4,3,2,3,2,2,2,1,3
"Dear senator i think that the electoral collages  should stay because .With out the the electoral college we could not have a party that is the tie breaker. So then we could not have a president .and they all so vote for the ''president and vice president all 538 electors but to win the vote a party must have 270 of the votes to win ''.and to have equal there are 2 senators and one member of the House of Representatives.

But a electors are chosen by the candidate's political partys  by law .In a certan way  and then be given a responsibilaties . And on every first monday in november the people vote for the prisedent that you want to win. but you are voting for the candidates electors  but each state has a plathora of electorals like texas has 38 electors and californa has 55 and florida has 29 so does new york they are given more because the more populatina a state has the mor electorals you can have . and one other good reason that electoral college is more sofishint way then popular vote because "" the winning candidate shares the popular vote and people starte to bicker about how to share it .

The large states  restored a good porshine of the weight in the political balances because the larger states have a bigger population so for example Obama got 29 elactoral votes  and the person who won would get 3 extera elactoral votes . but it is easeyer for the larger states to get attention from presidentail candidates in the campianes than the smaller ones because of how many larger ones have more electores vote then the other smaller ones.",2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I am for the use of self driving cars, most accidents that happen on the road are due to humman error. self driving cars are one safer due to reduced human error, they are more cost efected due to the fact that once all cars are self driving they will no longer need road signs as cars can communicate with each other, and also due to that fact it is more time effective and in being time effective will be more cost effective as well.

Humans error accounts for 90% of all road way accidents the other precent is due to mechanical failure. As Google has shown with it having driven more than half a milion miles without a crash that cars are cappable of being safe, you can make the argument humans are in these cars but the car only alerts the human inside if it can not make it through the problem its self, which these problems such as accidents are caused by human error to begin with the car can not account for something that is not supposed to happen because it should not happen with all self driving cars. which leads me to my next point that it will be better for the goverment and tax dollars.

Self driving cars are computers they can communicate with each other, they are programmed to read the road and communicate where they are and how fast they are going to the cars around them so all the appropriate changes to speed can be made in a fashion that humans cant due because we can communicate to each other from 2 miles away, and since humans no longer need to communicate at all all road signs that are required not to ensure that traffic knows where its going will be a thing of the past. with this out of the way there is no more need for upkeep of these signs and communication devices they can be taken down and recycled for something of more use or recycled for money saving tax dollars while also making the envioment better by reducing all the cluter along the road ways. it will also shorten how much time is taken to reach a destination which might just extend out time on earth.

Time is the most limiting factor in someones day, you can do a lot of things but you cant just make time out of thin air. commutes in the city of Las Angeles can take hours just because of traffic. with cars that communicate these times would be reduced so signifigantly they would be minimal to none, therfore if this was to happen we would save so much on gas, emmisions on cars would be lower causeing less money to go to making the air cleaner, green house effect would go down due to emmisions being less. This by its self might make it so we can stay on the earth longer cars make up a lot of emmision that goes into polluting our air, so in turn you might just be saving yourself from getting cancer if you switch to a car that gives off little to no emmsions. You might even be able to save money by swtiching to a self driving car, the Goverment could give tax subsides to those who buy the car becuase it saves on accidents, emmisions, and taxes to keep the signs up. another point is insurance, you would no long need insurance beacuse accidnets would no longer be a problem saving you thousands of dollars over your lifetime.

self driving cars are the way to a better and more safe future, they dont have the human error that accounts for 90% of all wrecks that happen on the road today. they are more effect for taxes sake causing our taxes to go to something you might actually want funded like school, the possiblities are endless. lastly they are just going to save you money, tax subsides from the Goverment, insurance isnt required anymore, and it saves you time allowing you to do what you really want to do with our day. Just like the old saying ""time is money"" are these cars will save you a lot of both.",3,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Yes i am aginst these driverless cars because anything can happen at any certain time like what if the car doesnt alert you if car is coming to close to you or if you are about to get into a crash , You could end up losing your life and they wouldnt know if the car failed or not or if it was just you who did something wrong and the manufacturer would seriously have to deal with some big problems if the car was part of the reason why that person died .

Other reasons why i am against driverless cars is that they dont seem that safe just because you tested just that ONE car doesnt mean any other car you make cant mailfunction either , there is ONLY five known places that are lleagal where you can actally test a driverless car that means every other state or country doesnt mean its safe because its illeagal , I wont believe it till i see its safe because many things could go so wrong , Like what if the car doesnt alert you in time when your trying to back up and you hit a car that would cause serious problems . Also what if there is a crash is about to happen and the car is coming straight towards you and the car alerts you to late what will happen then ? . You could end up dead because the car didnt alert you in time .These cars could aslo be very expensive not everybody could afford one because people are struggling ALOT , the only people who could really probably afford these are millionaires and other RICH people in the world . Even big brand name car comapines like BMW , GM , Mercedes-Benz , Audi , Nissan and even google even though they are not car company they just want to be the first ones to make a driverless car . Those big name brand car companies say that there will be driverless cars by 2020 which is about four years away from now but any thing can happen within fours years .

Nothing will change my mind about these cars unless i have proof that they can make these cars safe and affordable for people even though the JUST ONE car is millions but there main priority should be about the safety for people and they should ATLEAST make a back up system for the car incase something bad happens or if the car loses cointrol they should atleast make a way to make the car to automatically shut off or stop . so they should really stop worring about the design of the car and start worring about peoples safety.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Driverless cars are coming to us soon, which means less driving. In the article, they say driverless cars will do the driving 90 percnt of the time. The only time the people will really have to drive is if there is tricky traffic or roads, and pulling in and out of driveways. For the most part, these driverless cars cover all of your driving other then that. This would be great for people that have to drive a lot for work and that are very busy. It would take a lot of stress and pressure off of teens or even adults that get easily frustrated or really serve road rage. If you aren't paying attention to the road when you are driving for whatever reason, then your car would technically be doing it for you. In case you miss something, or happen to almost run a red light, driverless cars would prevent things like that from happening! The article states that the car will pay attention to you just as much as you pay attention to it, and the roads. Which is great, because this will basically cover anything bad that could happen wihile driving like speeding, or running red lights, which means less tickets and getting pulled over. This also could really help out with less car accidents and save lives tremendously! A little help would never hurt with driving for everyone, or something there to keep an extra eye on you to be safe, because there are a lot of not-so-good drivers out there. Everyone will agree with that! Overall, driverless cars would be brilliant and do wonders for anyone at all who drives.

"The face on mars is really just a butte; that is just a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. NASA has even proved that with the first pucture. But people still didnt beleave them.

Science can prove this by taking pictures every few years to see the diffrance. In the oragnle photo in 1976 it does look like a face but, that was from 1976. Then in 1998 they took a other photo and it dosnt look like a face at all but, people still didnt beleave them so in 2001 they took one more picture, and it revealed it is just a mesa in the martian area of Cydonia.

So that proves that the martian face is really a mesa. But you will still come up with awsers for the missing fetures like a ¨cloud¨ in the way, so the camraes couldnt get a good image.

"I Think is a great technology to now the students emotional expresions,and now their felings with that technology and can prevent allout of things. the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS [ Facial,Action Coding system]. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happines,surprise, anger,disgust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. In my conclusion imagine a computer that knows when you' re happy or sad that is awesome in my opinion that is Great we can prevent bullyng in the future bring help for students and other people, we can now if the student or person is in difficult times in her life or is happy in my conclusion i think that this technology will help the people in the future, the New Software is A great job that is my conclusion Thanks you.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus will gain insight on the planet itself. That our curiosity will likely lead us into our travels beyond our fears. We should not be limited by doubts, but to strive. We should meet the very edges of imagination, and concur our fears.

The author included lots of information of the planet Venus, and also some fun facts in which I also included in my passage. Venus is referred to as the Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth in density, the size, and sometimes in distance. In spance terms human have sent lots of spacecrafts to land on the cloud draped world. No spacecraft has survived the landing for more then a few hours on Venus. This is why a single space ship hasn't been on Venus in more than three decades.

With such a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. The author has been stating lots of backgound information about Venus which helps on knowing when we need to have to be able to stand the conditions. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times what we experience on our planet each day. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our very soloar system, even if Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Venus still has some features that are close to the same on Earth. The planet has a hard rocky surface that includes valleys, mountains, and craters. The author is talking about new ways to apportch the planet without having to land on it because of its toasty temperatures. There still isn't a way to get samples of its land, but with all the information they have gathered where they can have our machines last long enough that they can stand the harsh climates of Venus. However, all they need right now is to get up close. The author doesn't think because there's a obstical in the way of a new discovery you shouldn't give up. To learn to adapt with the information you have will help down to road t your success.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Ever since the very first cars were available for purchase it seems that everyone has wanted one. Well not so much anymore. People have very well evolved from the need of a car. We find different ways to get to school and work without a car. This is good for our planet and i'm sure mother Earth is thanking us for it, but in ten years from now will people even know what a car is?

Cars can play a big role in someone's life, it even has the power to take it away. In Bogota, Columbia a car-free day took place and buinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza said, ""It's a great opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Driving is something that takes years of practice to perfect and it should not be taken lightly. How much a state pays in repairs in damages caused by car accidents must be huge! So what would happen if no one drove anymore? What it be a change for good?

Less and less people are driving today as our world is changing. Accroding to Doug Short, the amount of miles driven by a person has dropped 9 percent. Many people find it more difficult to own a car and fill it with gas and have to drive somwhere. They would much rather live in a place where they can just walk to work. The use of a very advanced internet is a good way to keep in touch with friends without having to get off your couch!

Cars have a really big effect on the air pollution and it is really starting to hurt our Earth. Paris has recently had a near-record pollution. Paris had 147 of micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter! This goes for show what kind of effect a car's exhaust can do. By people resiting the need to drive anywhere and even owning a car, it is going to help with controlling the smog prdocued and hopefully help keep our Earth alive!

So overall by limiting car use and by people taking the bus or riding their bike, our Earth can remain healthy. Also by limting the use of cars we can use those costs and apply it somewhere more useful and possibly save lives! Of course cars can be good, but their bad seems to cancel out what little good they do indeed. Our world we live in is changing and people are straying away from cars. In ten to twenty years who will even know what a car is?",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"This Face from Mars is just a natural landform. It can't be created from aliens because aliens do not exist. Also, no one has ever seen a real alien before. They could just be making this up for the entertainment and attention. The Face even looks like a human head. I can prove that by the evidence that NASA has.

The Face even resembles a human head. There's shadowing that makes the Face a natural landform. The shadowing gives illusion of eyes, a nose, and mouth. According to paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers all over the world were waiting for the image to appear on a JPL web site. It revealed that it was a natural landform and not an alien monument.

It may look like the Face was created by aliens but it is really doubtful. There is not that much evidence that it could've been an alien's marking. Perhaps, it could've been the wind and water making rocks collide to form the Face. There could be missing evidence that NASA might've not catched, but NASA does have evidence that can say it was just a natural landform.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The technogy that there using it looks wonderful explain every single details how the techonology works and how the testing are. It explain that they make a machine that can read face and pictures just like the Mona Lisa face, they describe that

Mona lisa have 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusting, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. They explain this just because of a software computer read Mona Lisa face.

The coumputers are very smart at this time but a computer that reads face is a little bit complicated because they can do almost everything that a human wants but reading face is not so hard. Using technology to read emotions expressions of students in classroom is not so good because students can read faces too. A lot of people can read faces even if your mad or not people can see emotional in other faces .

The process of the software computer begin when the computer constructus a 3-D computer model of the face. it explain that thhe computer jus move muscle and the way faces move like in paragraph 3 describe "" all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit "". this mean that they read the muscle in the face to explain what motion humans do.

Reading faces is not so hard you can see people if they are happy,angry or sad is not so hard if see someone laughing you can tell that the person is happy or something make happy that person, like in the artticle say "" In fact, we humas perform this same impressive "" calculation "" every day . For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" this mean that most people can show feelings on their face. Of course some people have trouble to describe faces because some people doesn't show feelings and other do.

How people feel it depends on them. most people are happy and others sad but every single people can be happy it depends on them not in other persons. The people that are always happy are the ones who thinks positive the ones that love their self a machine can read their faces but the machine doesn't know that humans can change their mind in less than an minute we can be happy and then we can be sad for a sad news but for the computer it will take time to know when human change emotions because it has to read I again the whole face , compare to us the human can see fast when other person get sad. like a quote it say ""The Mona Lisa desmonstrate ir really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". this mean that the computer is smart it can read faces .

The technology is good for in some reason but reading faces too easy for human and humans doens't need a computer to tell hom the other person is feeling becuase humans can read faces too. their is no reason that human need a computer to tell them when ever a person is sad or happy. Humans can just look at their faces just to see of they are happy or sad.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"In this article, the author does not do a very good job with explaining why it would be worth pursuing the study of Venus. More was said about the awful climate and the countless risks that would take place rather than the benefits of risking lives and money to learn up close.

Firstly, a lot was said about the extremely dangerous climate on Venus, rather than how we could get around those dangers or why it would benefit us. In paragraph 3, the author says that there are ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"". All of these terrifying weather conditions are also met with atmospheric pressure that the author says is 90 times greater than earth's. In the same way, the author tries to argue against this point in paragraph 4 when talking about how it could have supported various forms of life long ago, but thoroughly contradicts himself in paragraph 3 when he states that it could now crush even a submarine and liquefy many metals. The author does not show very strong support as to the solution of getting past the dangerous climate that he describes to be so worthy of our pursuit.

Lastly, the author seems to describe only more risks and flaws in the plan to pursue study on Venus. In paragraph 2, he states, ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". Later he goes on to counter this by saying that spacecrafts could hover just above the atmosphere of Venus, but its thick atmosphere and bad climate will prevent explorers from taking photos or actual samples. Some of the main points of visiting other planets is to collect samples and research. But the author even says himself that those things would be prevented, and going to the surface of Venus to attempt research would seriously risk lives.

In conclusion, the author does not do a very good job of convincing one to believe that Venus is worth pursuing. He says himself that the climates and risks are high, but doesn't say much about the benefits of exploring this planet. Yes, it did once look strikingly similar to earth, but that was ""long ago"", and this is a new time with new risks that exploring Venus brings.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"I think we should change elections to popular vote because it will give the people more say in the elections, it will be more fair, and you would actually be voting for the president and vice president them selves, and not for a slate of electors.

First of all, if we change elections to be based off of popular vote people will have more say in the elections as to who gets elected. Forr example, when you cast a vote for the president you want to be elected you arent voting for the president, you are voting for a slate of electors who will vote for the president. But if we change it to popular vote you will actually be voting for the president and  vice president them selves instead of voting for a slate.

Secondly, if we change voting to popular votes it will be more fair. it will be more fair because votes wont be controlled by the electoral college so it will be more fair. thats why we should change voting to popular voting for elections.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
"In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" there are several given arguments to support whether the development on these cars are positive or negative. In my opinion, I think that the development of this futuristic concept is more negative and outweighs much of the positives.

Beginning with paragraph two, it states that Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific directions since 2009. I have one question regaurding that statement and that is, if these cars have been around for seven years already, why are they not the main source of transportation yet? The only answer to that is that these cars are not the most efficient way of transportation. In paragraph three, the author states that the ""smart-road system"", the only way for these driverless cars to travel, would require massive upgrades to existing roads. If we are being practical, it would not be possible for every road to be rebuilt so that it is sustainable for these driverless cars to operate on. In addition to that, how would we travel in the meantime while the roads are being rebuilt? It is simply not practical to do that with our busy societies today.

In paragraph four, it states that manufacturers soon realized that the development of smarter roads weren't going to be possible, so they turned to smarter cars. Although this is a little more realistic, there are still several flaws in this idea. Technology is not always a reliable source, and that is exactly what these manufactureres are doing-trusting technology. They're trusting these sensors in the cars to drive and operate smoothly without any human assistance. No matter how high-tech these cars are, there is always a chance of risk. You might argue that humans driving have just as high of a risk, but if you look at paragraph seven, it mentions that although these cars do not need human assistance, the driverless cars can not detect crashes or road construction like humans can. They have installed a warning system that lets humans know when they need to take over, which means that the humans must stay alert of the driving at all times. I think that this defeats the purpose of having a ""driverless car"" if you have to be prepared to take over once your vehical is headed towards something unfamiliar. In paragraph seven, it also mentions that the cars will have cameras built in to watch the driver to make sure that they are paying attention to the road at all times. Yes, this is safer, but again, it defeats the purpose of having a car that doesn't require a driver.

With that said, in paragraph eight, the author says that sitting in a driverless car, not having anything to do, could get boring so they are planning on programming entertainment sources in the car. In my opinion, I think that if the driver is supposed to be paying attention to the road, then the sources of entertainment in the car could potentially be a distraction to the driver and take their attention away from the road.

Although there are a few positives to these ""driverless cars"", such as saving fuel, the negatives outweigh the postivies. I believe that our society is safer and better off with normal functioning vehicals than getting into a car that comes with more possible risks.",4,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the idea of finding a way to explore and study Venus despite the challenges that would need to be overcome. The author supports this idea very well by noting and explaining possible solutions and explaining how succeeding can be scientifically productive.

In paragraph 3, the author explains the many factors that makes Venus an inhospitable planet and then explains the scientific value of being able to explore it in paragraph 4. This is done to show the extent of the challenges and the rewards of exploring Venus and how the scientific value would be worth overcoming the challenges.

On paragraph 5, the author then explains an idea from NASA on how exploring Venus can be possibly done. The author also explains possible technologies that can be used in Venus's harsh conditions on paragraph 7. Paragraphs 5 and 7 are used support the idea further by giving possible solutions explaining how exploring Venus can be potentially done sometime in the future.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus very well by explaining the benefits of doing so and giving evidence that exploring Venus can be eventually possible in the future.",2,4,3,4,3,3,2,2,3
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because this helps the computers know the student's reactions of things. If the computers knows what the student's reaction is, this could help them give the students what they are interested in. By knowing a student's expression, you'll know how they're feeling about a certain lesson. The Facial Action Coding System will have a huge impact on the teachers too. The FACS can identify six basics emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The Facial Action Coding System will have a huge impact in the classrooms. If there was a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, it could notify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. "" Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communtions,""

says Dr.Huang. He is right because sometimes you don't exactly tell another person how you are really feeling. If the computers knows this, it would be way easier to identify another person's feelings. If a computer knows that you're smiling, it knows you are happy about what you're looking at and the next ad they will give you will be similar. If you frown, it shows that you're not interested, so then the computer will give you a different ad until you are pleased.

In conclusion, the use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This will help impact not only the students but also the teachers. This technology will help benefit the students in their work. It helps identify what the student's interest is in and would make it easier for the teachers to give lessons. If there was a student who is not outspoken, the computer will help identify that student's emotions. Having this type of technology is very valuable of knowing what the student's emotional expressions are.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"In the article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. This system allows computers to identify human emotions by studying the facial features of that person. This is a very valuable piece of technology to have in the classroom.

In Paragraph 6, it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This could easily make test scores go up in many of our schools.

In Paragraph 1, when describing Mona Lisa, it says ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". If it can truly see emotions that specifically, we would be able to find out if a kid is feeling depressed, which would definitely drop the suicide rate thats spiked over the years. We could also identify if a kid is feeling angry, and find a way to calm him/her before there are any fights, or even worse, shootings.

Also, if we can see how a student feels about a particular lesson, we could adjust it accordingly.

In conclusion, this new emotion-recognition-technology described in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" could be very valuable to the classrooms.",2,3,2,3,2,2,1,1,3
"Driverless cars should not be coming! Driverless cars are dangerous they could malfunction and kill a lot of people.

For example one of the Google cars that just came out, crashed into a truck going five miles per hour.

How can you go that slow and hit something, imagine if the car was going 50 MPH!

Dont get me wrong this invention would be cool but it would be dangerous to all of us.

Okay so you want a driverless car right, but you have to be able to be ready and drive it when the car needs help..

Are you kidding me if you wanted a driverless car, you want a driverless car.

You dont want to be ready for when road construction is about to happen and have to drive, you want to have the car drive the whole time.

I know this is kind of lazy to say, but people want what they payed for!

They dont want a car that only drives half the time.

If you want to sell a driverless car, it has to be all the way, a driverless car.

Car makers should make cars the same way as they are making them now.

They way they have it now is great, unless something happens and cars can fly or something.

The way that cars can stop by themselves is amazing.

But having the car to do everything is to dangerous.

All the laws would change because of this, and they would have to make new ones.

There would probably be no cops. So, so many jobs are going to be lost.

Then what are the families going to do?

The cost of these things would be outrageuos!

Some of the cars now are really expensive, imagine how they will be when these things come out.

These cars would not even do anything because only the wealthy can buy them.

So what is the point when only a few people can buy them.

Unless they make it insanly cheap, which i do not see happening.

So the car companies wouldnt even make profit because no one has money for these cars.

In conclusion this is and all, and all a bad decision.

This would not help us, it will not save time, and it will not save us money.

The list goes on, and on.

This will be one of the worst inventions, there will be more car deaths.

Then whose fault will it be? consumers will start to sue the companies because they got in a wreck and everything is their fault, but they were not even driving.

This idea of cars is just a bad idea, jobs can be lost, people will die, and nobody will be making money or saving money.

"As we all know that the Electoral College was founded by our founding fathers for this great country. Changing the electoral college to popular vote is an amazing idea because well the people will have a more say so then just voting for an elector. In the three aricles I was given I happen to come a crooss to many  reason why the elctoal college should be banned or removed.

First of all, the Electoral College came to be because the founding fathers needed a compomise to set their differences aside to find out a way to elect the president and now that technology and human development has changed and every thing is changing why cant we change the way we elect our president. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. To win the presidential election you have to get 270 electoral vote. The article ""T

he Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong

"" it says that "" the electoral colege is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take-all sustem in each state, candidate don't spend time in states they know the have no chance of winning. this qoute means to say that the candidates dont take the time to go to place they dont think they're going to win over but thats the problem just because the other candidate has tht state one the people in the state could probably gradually go for the other candidate values or moral. "" Its official: The electoral college is unfair and outdated and irrational"". this quote means that we as American Citizen we need to improve our voting system ou with the old and in with the new.

second of all, their are many reason why th electoral college should change o popular voting. Well one reason why that they should change it is because ""under the electoral system, voters vote not for he president but, for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" this quote means that instead of voting for the president your actually voting for the people who are going to vote for them. When people go voting I would think that they would want to actually vote for Barack Obama but instead your actually not. That system needs to be banned if thats suppose to be a good way to vote well then it needs to be changed because if he U.S. is for the people and by the people  well then the ""people"" should have a more wider range of  who gets to be the president of the United States then just someone else voting for them.

To conclude the system for the electoral college should be changed and it needs to be changed. The elctoral college is a unfair and not the right way to do things and as a U.S. citizen changing it wiil make it easier for me to have a say so in who gets elected for the president  o the United States.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"A stop to driverless cars

Over the years technology has changed dramatically in many ways. Cell phones have the ability to shut off smart tv's with a push of a button, computers have the ability to hack humans with special softwares. People have developed many new ideas about technology with the modern world today. Driverless cars are a whole new introduction to technology today. Are people for or against drieverless cars?

Some positive aspects of driverless cars include the following, they can handle up to 25 miles per hour-special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. They can steer,accelerate, and brake themselves. All of the driverless cars are designed to notify when there is a road that requires human skills, examples would be accidents, construction zones, etc. When a vehical is in danger of backing up into an object, the seat vibrates to get the drivers attention. Driverless cars could also help senior citizens that are not capable to drive themselves places that they need to go.

Some negative aspects of driverless cars include, human drivers staying alert and ready to take over in a situation. Having someone drive for you when you have the ability to drive yourself could cause you to get bored at times. In case you do not feel your seat vibrate it would already be too late to try to control the car yourself. One major negative aspect of driverless cars that me, myself would mostly worry about is car malfunction. Car malfunction happens quite often and what would happen if all of a sudden the car starts going crazy? Drivers, passengers, and pedestrians would not be safe if the car had a malfuntion.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars would not be safe. Although the driverless car does have some positive aspects, most people would want to get in a car where they feel safe in, not a car where they feel something may go wrong in a tough situation. I am totally against driverless cars only because I would not like to be in a car that I do not feel safe in, let alone a car I have to worry about.",2,3,1,3,1,2,2,1,2
"There is a lot of different theories about whether or not we need to stop using cars or use natural things for gas. In the four passages I read about the German Suburb, Paris bans, car-free day in Bogota, and The End of the Car Culture. All of these passages make very good logical points. There are many different ways to look at all of these passages so ill explain the best I can.

Recently in Germany everyone is feeling like they want a car-free environment. In the suburbs this can be nice. Having malls not on the big highways away from town, they could have a mall on a main street. It could be a ""walk away"" mall. So you didnt have to waste gas and pollute the air. Its been recorded that 12% of greenhouse emissions in Europe are from passenger cars. In Paris there have banned driving because the smog is so bad. To all even numbered license plate numbers they have to leave there cars at home. The following day the odd numbered would have to do the same. If you did not follow the rules they unforced you would be fined 22 euros ($31), or your car would get impounded. They almost got up to there record pollution, which is almost as bad as China or Japan.

In Bogota they have not had cars for 3 years. They have been banned besides busses and taxis. The parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city. Because everyone is walking or riding bikes and at the park. If you don't have much money than you will spend the majority of your time getting places on your own like biking, walking, running, skating, and stuff like that. Therfore the obesoty rate will hopefully go down, the people living there will be healthier and happier. Another theory of cars is that were done with them. Some reseachers think that we are recently not into cars and arent using them as much. They think that we will slowly not need them and stop using them all together. Then have no cars and eberyone will be healthier haveing to get places on there own by foot or bike or something like that. Also once you stop using a car its hard to start using it again.

All in all theres no real proven right idea about cars and what will happen to us, the earth, and cars. We will find out someday. We might even learn how to fly by then too. We just never know until the day is here.",2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you care about our Earth? Human's actions towards the earth don't show that they care about it and how they're ruining it. We are destroying the Ozone Layer! One huge way we can prevent this is limiting the use of cars. By doing this it will take more stress off of you. It will also be more safe on the roads with less traffic! Most importantly, we will be saving our earth.

The first reason I believe it will be a good idea to limit the use of cars is taking stress off of us. We all have bad days, between work and school. Imagine just being able to hop on a bus that will take you to your destination. You won't have to worry about any bad drivers. This way you can just relax. Lets face it, we all get a little road rage every once in awhile that will even cause you to drive a bit crazy.

This leads me to my second main point which is less traffic! Some city's have a lot of unwanted traffic! If we limit the use of our cars and use the train we will get directly to where we want to go. Perhaps we use a bus, there may be many bus's on the road going different places but this will still be better than all the fuels we burn and put off into the air that is destroying the Earth.

My final and most important point is that we are destroying the Earth! We are damaging the Ozone Layer! If we cut out all of our vehicles and just have a few buses and trains for each city then this will help our earth and ozone layer very much! All the smog being put into the air is not good at all and it's not healthy for us humans either!

In conclusion, limiting the use of cars will help the earth and us humans in the long run. All the smog we breathe in and the damage it does to the earth is not good! We can help prevent this by limiting the use of cars and bring back buses and trains for our main way of transportation.",1,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Cars that drive them selfs well that sounds a lot easier than having to drive everywhere youself. If cars could drive themselves there would be a lot of pressure lifted off of people. For the fact we dont want to crash or get pulled over, the simple stuff like that. After all there still would be areas were humans would have to handle depending on how smart they make the cars. It would be nice to just sit and be able to look around while the car drives itslef and im not the only one to think that.

First, say you were going on a long road trip you could finally pay attention to the view for the fact your not the one whos driving so you could stare out the window and admire the view. Being able to see things you havent been able to see befor for the silly fact tha you were driving and had to pay attention to the road. There might be times were you have to take the wheel because of where you are and how many other vehicles are around, but you could always get back to admiring the view anytime. Say you had to wait in traffic you wouldnt be the one to have to do it because your not driving. There are a lot of good reasons to let the vehicle do the work for you.

Second, if the wehicle is high tech enough were it could sense danger or out of control skids or rollovers then you could feel more safe knowing youll be safe. Driving safe is a huge part of driving period if the vehicle can do that on its own without fail then you can do what you need in the vehicle like maybe text or call and still feel safe. Eventually the vehicles will become smart enough were it can do almost anything a person could do so it could handle more driving tasks on its own. So far the cars arent fully developed to where the vehicle is completely driverless. The in car system is actually a safety feature and safety is a huge concern.

Last, in the near future cars will be a lot more efficient and safer to get around in. There will be aguments about these vehicles. The point is the future is near and we are becoming a lot more advanced in technology. To move forward we need to create inventions tha no one has thought about weather they like it or not. Eventually everyone will get used to the idea.

The fact is we have a long way to go before the cars can truly do what we want. It is ahead of us eventually we'll see things we never thought we would. We have to keep moving forward with ideas like this brilliant one. Every step we take we keep pushing toward the idea of driverless cars and we will get there.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The author in ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I think that car manufacturers should be able to be on the streets more. Some examples are that they let out less CO2 and they use less gas to save you more money.

One example is that the driverless cars are safer than non driverless cars. Most of the people will agree that driveless cars are safer than people that are driving because they aren't focused on the road. They are more foucused on what is happing on their phones or watching what is happing around them instead o what is going on in frount of them. In the article it says that driverless cars have gone millions of miles without a single crash. While everyday people are crashing and killing other people because they care about what is going on their phone than what is going on the road. Sure they still will crash into other cars but with these cars but it will be less then what it is right now with people driving.

The second thing that makes driverless cars better is that they don't use that much gas and it'll help earth. Instead of paying like 50 dollars you will just have to pay 25 dollars to fill up your gas tank at the pump. You will start saving hundreds of dollars in just a year for chaniging to a driverless car and not only that it will also help on the place we live on. The cars we use now produces a lot of CO2 and that CO2 is hurting us but if we switch now we can change the world we live in by having less CO2 in the air.

Another way that driverless cars are better is that when you go on a long trip you get tired and feel like resting for a little bit. Well now you can, you'll be able to get on your phone and talk to someone or you could just lay back and see a movie that you have been meaning to see but just haven't had enough time to. You'll be able to do that and if something is going on around you the car's sensors will pick it up and tell you what you need to do. It would be a win-win thing case you get to do what you want to do and the car will take you where you need to go and it'll inform you if it needs you help to do something.

Those are some few exampels that shows us why we need to have driverless cars on the streets. So far it looks like the future is looking good for driverless cars for helping us be safe on the roads and saving us time and money. Its just a matter of time that we'll see everyone with driverless cars.",3,2,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"The use of the Facial Action Code System to read the minds of students is valueable in a classroom. There are many advantages that having this software used inside classrooms would bring. It make it more fun for both the students and the teacher.

The Facial Action Code System could let the teachers know if the students in her class are confused about something or even bored. I think that students would be less likely to want to learn about something if its nothing fun that is being associated with it. In paragraph 6 it stated that ,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored Dr. Huang predicts, Then it could modify the lesson"". I feel that would be effectived in the classroom becuase if the computer were too see that the student wasnt learning or bored while its on it then it could change up the program so its made more interesting for the student and make them learn more.

"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College is unfair to not only the state but everyone in the country. If only a few people are allowed to vote as electoral and then the rest is individual whats the point of having both? It does not make sense for the fact that the electoral votes are more imporatnat then the peoples votes. Its not fair because maybe the person who received more individual votes would be a more better president than the person with more eletoral votes. The Electoral College should be changed and who ever wins by the most popular vote should be president because that person may be better off.

To start off with, the electoral college shoudl be changed because in soure 2: "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenes of the system are wrong"" the author Bradford Plumer states ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (paragraph 10). What Plumer is saying is that the people who vote dont vote for the president, but for the people hwo come with him. Even though it should be the president you should be voting for. He does control our country and our future of what might happen. So why should the electoral college be voting for the slate of electors? Also in source 1: ""What is the Electoral College"" the author statea ""election of the President by vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" (paragraph 1). The author is saying that the candidates have electoral votes and individual votes. Why have both though? Shouldnt a citizens vote matter more than a electoral because we know who might be best for us? The electoral college probaly doesnt even listen to the canidate, only their electors slate which is not fair. It should be the canidate who seems to be best for us instead of who works best for the president.

Also, shouldnt the person who wins by the most popular vote be president? In source 2: ""The Indefesnsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it states ""Al gore received more idividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electorl votes to Gore's 266."" Plumber is stating the fact that even though Gore won buy individual votes, Bush still became president because of his electoral votes. This is completely unfair though because Gore had more of the countries attention than Bush since he won by more votes. Bush only got the attention of the Electoral College because of the elector slate he had. Isnt that wha the electoral college looks at? The electoral slate? How about the public, they know what is best for their country and if the person with the most individual votes is it, then let it be it. Furthermore, in source 1:""What Is the Electoral College"" the authore states ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all the electors to the winning president."" (paragraph 7). This is unfair because the candidates dont actually spend time in states they know they wont have a chance of winning in, but shouldnt all votes count? They never know if that state wants to pick them so why not show them who you are? In 2000, the candidates doing the campaign didnt send it to seventeen states. They didnt send it to Rhode Island and South Carolina including voters in 15 of the largest media markets didnt get to see a single campaign ad. Now thats not fair because everyone vote should count. If a person doesnt get to see then they wont vote but the person with the most votes should win. So why think that no one would vote? You never know.

Although these reasons state that switching the electoral college is a good idea, there are some benefits of it being there. In source 3: ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" the author Richard A. Posner states ""The electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution...""(paragraph 21).This states that despite the fact that not a lot of people like the electoral collage they help balance the votes of the states and help continue the rights of the Constitution. This helps with th popular vote of the states and gets the most attention than smaller states. On the other hand, even though the electoral college evens the votes of the oublic, what if they choose the other candidate then the one that the public chose? It wouldnt be fair not only to the state but the other people who choose that candidate and the candidate him or herself.

Furthermore, the Electoral Collage should be switched so that the candidate with the most popular vote wins instead of the candidate with the most electoral vote. They should win because the person who has the most votes is better off with the public.

Sincerely,

Fellow Citizen",4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Electoral College,are you against it or not? I would perfer that we keep this ""despised method"" for choosing our president.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012 Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. This is a desierable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful prsident. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised-to feel that their votes don't count,that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.

The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay attention to the campaign, knowing that they are going to decide the election. the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. A large state gets more attention form presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. There is no pressure for the run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.",2,4,2,3,1,3,3,3,2
"In many places all across the world, the amount of car usage is decreasing more and more as the years pass by. In places such as Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; and Bogota, Colombia; there are times when you are fined if you operate a vehicle. Why would a city ban one of the most useful personal transportations invented? These cities all had goals for transportation to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and costs, improve safety, relieve stress, and to promote public transportation. All of these goals, by which were accomplished when the use of motor vehicles were limited.

According to source 1 'In German Suburb, Life goes on without cars', the residents of Vauban, Germany disagree with the usage of cars. The entire suburb is designed to be ""car-free"", besides the main thoroughfare. Understand that car ownership is allowed, but there is an exteremely scarce amount of parking spots, and that the price of a garage, that is located at the edge of this suburb, costs $40,000 when you buy your home. As a result of this, 70% of residents do not own cars, and 57% of residents sold their car to live in Vauban. The goal was to start a movement called 'smart planning', which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.

According to source 2 'Paris bans driving due to smog', the city of Paris, France enforced a partial ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were given a 22-euro fine, which is equivalent to $31, because they were driving their cars. Diesel fuel was at fault for the excessive amount of smog in the city. Diesels make up 67% of the vehicles in France. The goal was to decrease the amount of smog throughout the city.

According to source 3 'Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota', the residents of Bogota, Colombia are familiar with a 3 year running 'Day without Cars'. There is a large turnout where one day out of the year the use of motor vehicles is banned, which would face violators with a $25 fine. The goal of this city was to reduce smog and promote alternative transportation.

In conclusion, the result in limiting the usage of cars would be very effective and beneficial. The residents, as a whole, would save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and costs, improve safety, relieve stress, and promote public transportaion.",2,2,3,3,2,2,2,1,3
"Lots of people think the face on Mars is an alien or something else,its really not. The face on Mars is not an alien because there is no proof of it being an alien. Only few people have said it looked like an alien,but they have no proof of that being true. Lots of scientist and NASA have proof that its not an alien and that it is something else thats there. People who think that the face is an alien, they are wrong.

The face on Mars is not an alien because NASA said it was a sort of rock formation. Also that it looked like a human head. NASA never said it looked like an alien or that they had proof of it being an alien. NASA said ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". NASA also gave proof that the shadows gave an illusion of the rock formation that it looked like a face.

Another way that it did not look like a face is that MOC said it was just a landform on Mars. MOC also said that the face was not and alien and revealed what it actually was. MOC said "" MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos...anxious web sufers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". MOC had proof and a picture that the face was not an alien and that it was something diffrent.

Finally, you can see that most of the scientist said it was a type of landform or something else. They never said that is was an alien. They all had proof and a picture to tell us that it was a natrual landform. The face is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a type of landform.

"I feel like we shouldn't have driverless cars for many reasons. There are already many accidents about people falling asleep behind the wheel, having driverless cars just makes it easier for collisions. If you were behind the wheel of a driverless car then you can easily get too relaxed and end up falling asleep, What if there's an emergeny and you can't wake up for a response in time?

There's some good reasons too. Such as if you were at a party and there was drinking. You can rely on the car to get you home safely. The car can keep you out of harm by you not driving.

All together I find it a bad idea. We do't have much research on driverless cars and we are not skilled enough to create them to be able to drive on the road. We don't have enough research to do this because what if there is a bug in the system, the car can easily break down or it can go rogue and you can be put in a lot of danger. So yes, I find it a bad idea to have them, but it could be in the future.",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,1

Dr. Huang, a college preofessor, predicts that "" A classroom computercould recognuze when a student is confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor. This would be very valuable. Some students get stumped by certain things in the classroom and they dont ask the teacher for help in fear of being laughed at or made fun of because they dont know. This would help the student to where he doesnt even need to ask to go deeper into something because the computer can tell by his face that he doesnt get it. The computer can also read when the person is bored. I think this is a big one as well. Most students wont go out ad tell the teacher that the lesson is boring but they sure do think it. wouldnt it be great that a computer reads that and sees the student is bored and makes the lesson more entertaining?

"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it prestents. In the article, the author explains the difficult conditions in Venus and the risks humans have by exploring and studying Venus. He explains that studying Venus is effective because astronomers are fascinated by Venus and it may well once have been the most Earth-like plant on the solar system.

The author explains about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like plant on the solar system, and compares the similarities both the planets, Venus and Earth, might of had. The dangers of human studying Venus are evident as he explains Venus atmosphere, that renders standard forms of photography and videography ineffective when a ship is orbiting or hovering safety far above the planet's surface.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some electronics are being tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition. Another project is looking back to an old technology in the 1800s that played an important role on WW ll.

"Cars have been part of our daily lives for decades and have become somewhat idolized in American culture. But cars are slowly killing our planet and are speeding up the Greenhouse effect taking place within our Earths atmosphere. We've become entirley too dependent on cars to get us where we wish to go, making many people lazy. Cars also emit gasses that can harm our internal body structures, causing problems with lung diseases and just the simple act of breathing. Many cities from all over the world have taken measures to limit the use of cars in daily life, making their homes cleaner and healtheir to live in. More cities should start to do this as well to help save our planet and oursleves.

Environmentalists have hated cars for a long time because of the harmful effect it has to air we breathe. When near-record levels of smog filled the air of Paris, they enforced a temporary driving an in efforts to reduce the smog and within five days the smog cleared enough to allow citizens to start driving once again. In America, the number of drivers and car owners has been steadily reducing since 2005 and many experts belive it will continue to. A revolution could be started if enough people stop driving personal vehicles and instead walk, bike, or even just use public transportation.

People have adjusted over the years to things being given to them without them doing much to get it. Cars contribute to this and have caused laziness in many car owners. In Bogota, Columbia they have initiated and annual car-free day where everyone has to get to their jobs by means of biking or walking or taking public transportation.

They are an insidious problem.

"Every 4 years, the first Tuesday in November. When its time for it, president elections is one of the most hectic times of the year. But what should the winner depend on? Electoral College should be removed by the government and just have popular vote be responisble. Electoral College can have electors go on the opposite canidates side so they lost a vote, which is just wrong. This argumentative essay will argue why Electoral  College should be taken out by government.

One may say that Electoral College is the best system for voting, but then again that may just be the cheaters. Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

Even though there are people who support the Electoral College, there are many people who are against it. In source three, Posner states ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.""If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?""""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""(Plumer, paragraph 11). Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. ""a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does..."", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote.

To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count.",4,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that we should keep the Electoral college rule. This is simply because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have always used this rule in all of our elections for presidents. Also because it is win or take all in this process witch mean if the canidate gets a majority of the votes then he or she gets the votes for that state.

I think we should keep the Electoral college this is because our founding fathers put it in the constitution and we have been going by this rule for all of our past elections and for all of our winning canidates. we have never changed or strayed off from this rule why should we all of the sudden change it? I do not think we should change it because some people disagree with it. You can have your own opinion about it but i do not think just because of someone's opinion we should change what we have been doing for many years before them.

Also i think we should not change this because it has helped us for so long to help elect the president. As in if he or she gets a majority of the votes for that state the they get all the votes for that state. It is a win or take all position. This also allows the people to have a vote and say of who the president should be and who they want it to be.

I understand why alot of people disagree with the Electoral college rule though. This is because the voters who do not get a majority rule do not have a vote in who will be president.

"I do not believe that using the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions would be beneficial to classrooms, because if students are confused they can simply ask their teachers questions, and when students are bored, the computer can not simply make them entertained.

Most teachers have expirience dealing with students who do not immediately understand or comprehend their lessons, and when students ask questions, their teachers can answer them, and attempt to better their students' understanding. Quoted in the text, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto para. 6). This quote shows an idea of how the computer reading human emotions could potentially modify lesson plans based on student confusion or boredem. I don't agree with this statement because, while the computer would be able to read human emotions and track confusion, it still wouldn't be able to track what particular topics each student is confused about, and I believe the most efficient way of finding that out is for teachers to ask students questions, or for students to ask teachers questions.

Although this computer could potentially read facal expresions and features, it could not simply come up with solutions to students' bordem or tiredness. Often times teachers have students sit down and take notes, and although many students do not particularly enjoy taking notes, it is a manditory part of many classes, and teachers being able to know that their students are bored will not have an affect on most of their lessons. The text states, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto para. 6). Not only do I believe that this would be an invasion of privacy when computers are able to track people's specific moods and advertise to them based on their moods, but especialy so if this was implimented in a classroom for a teacher to be able to track specific students' moods and emotions every day.

The author tells us how Venus is ""one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"" and also the second largest plantet with the ""nickname misleading since Venus is actually a planet"". There so many things to learn about when it comes to different planets. It would be worthy to go study more things about plantets so we can know about them and maybe one day lots of people coud go on one of these plants without just being a scientist. The bad thing about is we still don't have the best ways to get there and back saflty.

There is 97 percent of carbon dioxide in Venus and plus more of a challeng is the clouds of highy corrosive and eve 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It makes it a little hard to be able to go on Venus because of all that. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studiying Venus. For example, osme simplified eletronice made of silicaon carbid have been tested in a chamber simulation the chaos of Venus's surface.

stiving ot meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only becasse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded ot meet the very badges of imaination and innovation.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Dear state senator,

There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote. However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting.

It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. ""the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense."" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.""(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time.

However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote."" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. ""Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College.

All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Have you ever looked a photo of someone and wonder how they feel? Yes well now you can Thomas Huang form the neckman institute for Advance Science at the University of Amsterdam. Im all for this Facial Action Coding Sytem. It could show us how people long before use felt when getting there picture painted of picture taken. people could know how family member and friends felt before they past away. what if we could know how animals felt with the FACS?

We dont know how people felt back then, we didn't know what they were going through, but with the FACS we could get a general idea of how they felt at that time in there life. Say you had a family member that passed away that you never met before but you want to know if they were a happy, sad, or mad person you could use the FACS to know so you dont have to hear it from someone else. Wouldnt it be cool to know what animals are feeling? If this FACS could show us how humans felt wouldnt you like to konw what your pets are feeling if your pet was sad and you didnt know,but you use the FACS you would know and then you and do something with your pet to keep the happy. Now you might be asking how does this FACS work well ehrn the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. examples your frontalis pars lateralis muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are suprised, your orbicular oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. these reasons i just listed are why i support the FACS!",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0

i think people should be concius and start reducing their car usage becasue is only for theis benefit but for other or even something more importantr their families. car companies are going to be affected by this change. but their going to be more affective in a future when they see what they have done. not only for the human race but for theis loved members. so i think the advantages of limiting tha car usage is good in many ways but their still one factor is going to bother people like going to some places really far away to see some of theirs family members.",2,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Natural land forms are mistaken for 'alien activity' all of the time. Why should this time be any different. It is simply a natural landform.

There have been other natural mesas on Mars that have been mistaken for alien monuments. The rock formation is not even in the actual face, it is the shadows that the rocks ceate when the sun hits them just right. There was a storm that clouded the Face, so the details have been obscured.

There has been no other proof of aliens, only rambungcous conspiericy theorists. If we had more proof of extra terrestrial life, the theory of the Face would be more believable. In the American West, we have landforms that are common to Martian buttes or mesas. ""It reminds me most f Middle Butte in Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Explorations Program, Jim Garvin. The cheif scientist believes that the Face is a natural landform, and that he compares it to natural landmarks on Earth.

More evidence can and will be provided. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" sayes Garvin. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egytian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" With modern cameras, we can see the precise details, and with clear sky over the Face, it proves that the Face is just another natural land form.

We know of other natural land forms on Mars, illusions of shadows, no other proof of aliens, similar to natural land forms on Earth, it would be simple to find little details, and with modern cameras, that take sharper pitures proves that the Face is just a natural landform, not alien activity.",2,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I agree with the statement saying that we should use this technology of emotional expressions because it could help people with knowing what is gong on with the person's personal life. Even though kids would not like it it should be brought to use because there can't be anymore drepression into kids life.

First reason why I think we should use technology like this is because it says that, ""even though individuals often shwo varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly."" This means that if we start using this type of technology we can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason why we should use this technology is because it says, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait taht conveys happy, worried, etc."" This could mean that even if you might know what they feel you could most possilbe be wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstartion is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

In conclusion, I agree with this kind of technology because it can help people understanding other people's feelings. It could also demonstration how fast time is going by technology. Also, what technology can do nowadays.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars is an easy excuse to get yourself into a car accident. I truely dont think the world would be ready for a technological advancement like this.

I am against driverless cars. As the aricle states, the cars aren't truely driveless. When the author stated this, it made me still think that this idea could still be dangerous. I feel like there will be more accidents with driverless cars than with regular cars of today. My feeling is how will a self-driving vehicle sense that there is a crash? How will it know if there is a car stopping in front of them? It just seems like an easy way to get into an accident. I think it would be better for the world to have an assisting car, not a self driving car.

In saying this, the world is not ready for a self-driving car in the near future. I think that in the hands of somebody smart and responsible, this idea would be great. But i think the world has to many irresponsible people in it to have a privelage like this.",1,3,0,2,0,1,1,0,1
"The reason we want you to be in our program is that..Luke Bomberger had no idea that his life would change vey soon, when Don Reist (Luke's friend) said that he was invited to go with him in Europe in a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no so, he went with him for an opportunity of a life time.

In 1945, World War ll was over in Europe and many countries were left in ruins. 44 nation joined together to form a UNRRA ( the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitatiion Administration ). After that the UNRRA hired the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young farm animals that were shipped overseas. When luke turned 18 years old right before he arriving in Greece, which meant he could be drafted for military service. In 1947, Luke made nine trips-the most of any Seagoing Cowboy was ever been through.

The cattle-boat trips were unbelievable opportunity for a smal- town boy, Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States and a month to get to China. Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled up from the lower holds of the ship. Stalls had to be cleaned. Luke also found time to have fun on board, esspecially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played music, played games, sports they played, and also read to have some relaxation.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy for Luke was much more an adventure for him it also gaved him much more experience to the world than he imagined. It made Luke more aware of peole of other countries their needs. and that awareness stayed ith him, leading his family to host a number of international student and exchanged visitors for many years.

This is why we need you to be in our program have exiting adventures just like Luke Bomberberger did when he was an adult. You can have the fun to if you want to have unique visit to places. please come join us with this program and have your lifetime adventurre with all the food suplies, games, reading and more so, leave your stuff at home and, come have the fun and exiting trips, visit with our program.

"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars when it spotted what appeared to be a likeness of a human face in a region called Cydonia. Over the years there has been speculation that this ""face"" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the ""face"" for what it is: a mesa.

There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface. For example, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Technology has advanced much from since 1976 and 2001 image is a clear example. The 2001 image also has another detail that can't be left out: it was taken on a cloudless Martian day. A last piece of evidence sure to disprove the alien theory is the fact that Earth has similar landforms on its surface. The Face on Mars, ""...is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

To conclude, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The image from 1976 was photographed with equiptment that is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the Martian sky was cloudless when the 2001 image was taken, and the 2001 image proved that the Face on Mars is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, something commonly found on Earth.",2,4,3,4,1,2,2,2,2
"Yes i think that the technolody to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom is valuble. One reason why i feel like this is a good diea is because it lets you help the student out if they are deprssed or something. Because not alot of students may not say anything because they dont want their business out there in public. And iIf you use this technology then youll be able to come talk to that student 1on1 as a techer face to face to solve the problems they they are delaing

with.

Its basically a 3-D computer model that scans your whole face. And all 44 major muscles in the model must must move the exact same just like human muscles should. It has 6 basic emotions which are happines,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness. So its like a software and you scan your face and it shows your emotions and you are basically having the human traits when

it comes down to

emotions.

Us humans preform the same task when it comes to trying to paint sculptures of peope and paintings.

For example Mona LIsa she was a human that alot of people know about because of the well known Painter Da Vinci ended up making a famous painting of her. Her painting made alot of people smile when they seen her cause it showed different types of emotions when looking at her.

But now people are starting to benfit the future as technology is only going to improve as we live life. For example say that you smile when a web ad appears on your screen because it may be something that you are interrested in. But alos say that what if a different type of ad shows up and then you have a sad or different type of expressin or emotion. Then the screen will go to a different ad because it bascially scaneed your face. And it seen how you reacted so it made up some changes.

But if i was to judge i think this is a good use of technology. aAd i feel like we could use this not only in a psoitve way. But to help benefit the next geneartion of people in the future.",2,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"In the artical ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is trying to convince the reader that studying Venus is woth pursuing dispite the dangers in may cause and shows us. Sending people to a planet we know is dangerous is not a good idea if we dont have the technological advancements that we think we may need to protect the people going to Venus. The history of this planet is important to know about because it is very similar to Earth and not is one of the hottest planets in our solar sysem.

The author states that in the past Venus is thought to be a lot like Earth. Scientists think that Venus was ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Since Venus is thought to be the planet most like Earth scientist want to discovey what happened to in that made in inhospitable and why it happened to this planet. They have shown that Venus still has a lot of similar features that are very closely related to Earths. The author says scientists would like to get more information by landing people and spacecraft on the surface of Venus but the spacecraft has been proven to last only a couple hours on Venus. This is why ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more that three decades.""

Although the spacecraft cant last very long on Venus it isn't NASA's fault says the author. Venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide""

It also has clouds that contain sulfuric acid which are ""highly corrosive"" and causes serious damage to the spacecraft and in unsafe when coming through the atmosphere of Venus. Since Venus is so closely related to Earth it still does have earthquakes, stormes, volcanic eruptions and many more things that could make the mission even harder for them. The author knows that if or when the spacecraft gets though the atmosphere of Venus the planet has a surface temperature of about 800 degrees Farenheit and that is nowhere close to what we have here on Earth.

NASA is working on creating a ""blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This would be a more sustainable temerature of about 170 degrees Farenheit and would rest easy at about sea level on Earth. This would allow the astronauts to view the surface of Venus without being severly harmed. NASA is still looking in on other ways to make the trip to Venus mush safer and effecent for them. NASA may not even send people up to explore the planet it may send up a robot that can sustain the harsh terain that Venus presents. The author explains that this still could not be the way they should do this. He compairs it to putting a cellphone in acid or heat and doesn't think it is a smart idea.

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is presents. The artical was mainly focused on the dangers in and didnt really show that Venus was worth studying and mainly showed why it was too dangerous to study. The author explains that the history of this planet does tell us a lot and since it is one of the most closey related planets to us we should learn more about it, but a lot of dangers come with that and we need to be willing to face them. We need to work on our technological advancement to make sure the mission is safe.",3,1,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Some claim that a picture of a natural landmark and a shadow is really a sign of alien lifeform or a civilization. Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.

Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.

Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this ""face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.

Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.

In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.

Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.",3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I agree with the idea of ""driverless cars.""

I agree with this becuase it could cause a lower number in people drinking and driving.

This project could also be a whole lot safer.

Machines are only as smart as the human making them.

So there could be flaws and mishaps that can occur, but through trial and error we can fix those problems and perfect the car.

The idea of driverless cars can be dangerous in the matter of if something goes wrong and the driver is not alert it would cause an accendent.

When I read this passage i thought to myself.

With a driverless car I could go to sleep while I go to my destination.

Then I read that the car will alert drivers in situations that the car cannot handle.

the creators should fix this issue so that drivers dont have to still pay 100% attention to the road and the driver could relax.

The idea of driverless cars can be a whole lot safer too.

Mostly because if car accendints are caused by humans, a car can fix this problem.

Like in the passage they used sensors to see around the car to help navigate through traffic.

I agree with the idea of driverless cars because it would be safer.",1,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever made a shadow puppet with your hand. It is pretty cool when you get some that are pretty complicated you can also do this with rocks. So let us get back on track,

the "" FACE"" on mars is a formationof rock wether it be by martin creatures or by nature. I am going to beon the side it was a natural formation. i will support my claim with these three reasons; rock formations, life on mars, and publicity.

My first reason is rock formations. For example there is a vast amount of mesas and or buttes on mars and on earth. This example shows that rock formations can appear almost any where. My second supporting idea is that an astroid could have hit in that rock patch like in Arizona . This example shows that astroids could have played a part in the rock's formation. My third reason is that the rock formaion could have been a natural thing like mountains for example. This example shows that nature can do some weird things. In conclusion the ''face'' on mars could actually be a rock formation on the planet.

My second reason is that it is an illution.For example you can change the sun light amount on the ''face'' and it will look nothing like a face. This example shows that the rock formation could be an optical illution. My second statement is that mabye just maybe be an photoshop thing.

"The so called ""Face"" on Mars is simply a landform created by nature. There are conspiracy theorists who like to believe that this is not true and NASA has something to hide. They also like to believe that because the images of the ""Face"" are not high quality photographs, that has something to do with hiding the secret of life on Mars. The fact of the matter is that there is no secret and if there was life on Mars, it would benefit NASA to share that knowledge to gain money for their space programs.

To start with, the ""Face"" on Mars is ""...the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa -- landforms common around the American West."" The first sentence in paragraph twelve simply disproves that the ""Face"" on Mars could be anything mire than a face. Looking a little deeper into the text, it becomes clearer how NASA has nothing to hide when it comes to the ""Face"". By looking into paragraph two and paragraph three it becomes clearer that NASA has looked into this odd rock formation clearly and can see that there is nothing to hide from anyone.

Another argument that conspiracy theorists bring to the table is that the original images from the Viking were blurry, making it hard to see anything surrounding this rock formation. These theorists say this believing the images were purposely blurred in order to hide something from the public. The truth is that the Viking took its photo in 1976, the MGS in 1998 and again in 2001. Being that the newest image until 2001 was the one taken in 1998, it is obvious that there couldn't be high quality pictures taken from a spacecraft back then. Also, the image taken in 2001 is way more high definition and you can clearly see that the image depicts a simple rock formation. So, the argument that the blurry image is hiding something must be false.

In conclusion, none of the theories brought up against the pure facts laid out could conquer. The theory tree was easily chopped down but the mighty fact axe, becasue the conspirers could not bring any evidence to support their argument. Also finding how every argument that NASA has nothing to hide, and that the images clearly show nothing but a rock formation is clearly supported by evidence. Facts prove that there is no way the ""Face"" on Mars is anything other than a simple landform.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"In 1976 pictures where taken of Mars with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have dicovered that the pictures look like a face on Mars. We can garentee that ""aliens"" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that Mars was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.

Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The ""Face"" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on Mars they would try to keep the form from changing, right?

Yes we know what you are thinking, ""That cant be Mars doing that,"" but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on Mars. We have no reason to believe that Mars has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that Mars has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.

Futhermore we have concluded that the ""Face"" on Mars is just rock formation. There is no futher information on the ""alien"" therory and that this is out of the picture.. As you can tell in the picture there is other rocks surrounding it and it is just like the other rocks, they have shadows and the ""Face's"" shadow is just more life like.

That is like saying that weather guy like oh well its gonna be 60% chance of rain and thunderstorm here in the mid east of country no no not it all all because the weather guy only gets stuff right 80%-90% of weather right shoot weather people struggle to predict indiana weather because one season supposed be harsh and deadly potentional winter right while we may have that but like one day it wants be 60 degress fariheit like no its not supposed be that warm in indiana in winter when we think winter we think snow, hail ,snow storms , chilly winds any type extreme colds but warmth no no not at all partly cloudy ok sure some sunshine with cold windchill sure but extreme odd warmth for time of winter no because these technologies that help us as people aren't always helping like there is always something wrong with technology because we made the technology and one characteristic we passed down to technology and that is inperfection in fact we intentionally made the technolgy to some degree less smarter than us so we can always have room inprove ourselves and you wouldn't want something made to be a tool be superior to you right of course you don't so why use technology to replace humans why not except some things we have and here the thing paragraph number two even says I am right because you cannot calculate emotions with math no as also talked in paragraph number 3 emotions are discovered when our muscles move certain way our body instinctively tells us to do so not fully instinctlively because our thoughts and nerves go so fast we sometimes in instant gratification stuff lose precious time to react when needed to and our nerves and speed of the nerves why we is limited by our very own fixed speed and thoughts and emotions and stuff. Also paragraph 4 says each facial expression is universal so even though we all have similar look when happy sad, angry , depresssed doesn't mean all angry and depressed people look same and we can hide or have our feelings mixed up with so much thoughts in our head that is happening.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I dont agree with this idea of driverless cars becuase my first thought when I hear ""Driverless Cars"" is i woldnt be safe. Thats my concern; safty in the car. If the car doesnt require you to drive then something in the wires and sensors could malfunction.The car could sense something and break quickly and could cause accisents or cause the person in the vhecial to get hurt. In this article they say that the car would need a whole lot of sensors, on the left rear wheel a rotating sensor on the roof etc. If you ask me this sounds like i would be riding down the street in a space ship. It says they tested a car on an embedded track with electrial cables, thats not safe. Also it says it would be a massive amount of money to make these roads. Who has all that money to comtribute?

They say that the cars arent truley driverless, they still alert the driver to take over when certian things happen. So whats the point of a driverless car if its not technacally driverless? Even they ask themselves that in the article.

They say driverless cars are the new thing but recently BMW has came out with the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" meaning you have to keep your hands on the wheels. This is the total opposite of driverless cars. I would choose this meathod. Speaking of BMW other high-end cars like: Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan are plannng to have driverless cars by 2020. If driverless cars are as safe as they say then why are they only happening in expensive/ High-end cars. Everyone cant afford these types of cars espically adding on driverless to an alreday expensive car, only the rich will have a driverless car.

When i hear ""Driverless Car"" i think of sitting in a car where you have to press one botton and enter the location and go. this article says the human driver mustremain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requries.

In conclusion i think driverless cars are pointless because they arent completly driverless, they requrie a ton of wires, raido signals, sensous, etc. They are expensive and the USA is slready in debt and were wasting money on more and more pointless stuff. So if you ask me driverless cars are not my thing.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Limiting car usage can be helpful as we try to reduce our negative impact on this great big miracle of a planet. Reducing or even eliminating the use of cars would greatly drop the amount of damage done to the ozone. Even then, some people living without cars found their life to be less stressful. Aside from these two simple solutions, a life without cars can save so much more.

First off, without cars the pollution that's depleting our ozone would be nearly gone. The gas emissions from tailpipes account for 12% of greenhouse gas emitions, and in some places even 50%! Life this advanced on a single planet in this great big universe is such a miracle. We need to protect our planet from greenhouse gasses if we wish to continue to exist on this planet.

Secondly, not only do cars cause a great deal of life threatening polution, but some people living without their cars found their life to be less stressful. Owning a car is not only expensive due to maintainance but because of these fluctuating gas prices! If you were to sell your car now and either walk, bike, or ride the city bus to work or school you would save thousands. While keeping city busses would still cause some pollution it's not as great the amount of pollution as millions of cars. Also, walking would help keep the world in shape since it is a great way of exersize.

In conclusion, getting rid of cars would be the best thing we can do for the planet. Not even getting rid of them but at least reducing the risk of them. It would keep the world in shape, and keep your money in your wallet. All of this while reducing the harm we are doing on our miraculous planet.",2,3,1,3,1,2,2,1,2
"I am for driverless cars. I think that it's incredible that our technology is becoming so advanced and that we know how to create such a legendary car. In paragragh two, it's said that television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves and it's finally becoming a reality.

There are pros and cons of this idea. Even though I think a driverless car is a good idea there needs to be improvements and more work on these cars. A pro of this invention is it can take you where you need to go and is pretty much safe. For example, a driverless car would be great for someone that is intoxicated that needs to go home. Even if someone is intoxicated that person would still need a designated driver because the car needs a human driver that must remain alert and ready to take over when the situation requires, as stated in paragragh 7. Another pro, which is stated in paragragh 8, is ""some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers need to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" That is a great safety feature about this car. Most car accidents are from texting and driving and with this system it can end texting accidents. A con of the driverless car is that it still needs improvements. This car is not completely ready to be sold in dealerships. To ride in this car the human driver must stay alert and pay attention at all times.

With everything said about this driverless car I think it's a great idea and should keep being improved so it can be in dealerships. In my opinion it will be the best car out there and less accidents will happen. Can't wait for what our technology can officially do for us.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear state senator,

You seriously need to change this whole ""Electoral College"" voting system. It's not right and not accurate. Wouldn't it be fair if the people had a say in this? We..The People?

Popular vote definetly makes more sense in this case. It's proven that an electoral vote would sometimes end in a tie, resulting in a ""You're President, You're Vice President"" scenario. No one wants to go through a tie cause the election would go to the House of Representatives and then they would decide who is who. That's pretty stupid...if I do say so myself.

Now if the people, us, had a say in this...Then we'd defiently have a winner. No ties, No mistakes, No nothing. Just a plain, clean winner. The electoral college is unfair to voters to be honest. The electoral college is irrational, unfair, outdated and annoying. No one uses it anymore. Due to it being completely unfair to citizens and states alike.

The Electoral College rule says ""It requires a presidential canidate to trans-regianl appeal."" Don't you think we know that? Then there's the fact that only ""Big States"" have a say, what about the smaller ones? There are people there too you know.

The Electoral College does avoid the problem of ""Run-Off Elections"" but that doesn't help the fact that we should all have a say.

Well, Nevertheless, you can understand why im so fed up with this ""Electoral College"" nonsense. It's stupid, outdated, and unfair.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"The ability to be able to read students emotions can be helpful and cool but it can also be redundant. The ability of being able to see what emotions of others is something that occurs in us almost natually, but being able to tell exactly how someone feels about something can help people such as psychologists or teachers extreamly. Being able to see what students think about a lesson or about a video they are watching in school can be quite helpful.

If a teacher or some type of educater is able to recieve information about how someone feels, it could help the teacher see if the student actually enjoys the lesson or is at least interested by it. The ability of being able to tell how a student is thinking could change the way of how figuring out emotional information about the student and help the teachers improve on their work and teachings. But this technology could be creepy for some users. The ability to know if a person likes an add off of a website also means that their face is being displayed for someone or something to see it. A lot of people won't like that idea or not like the ability of doing so to be right or normal.

The ability of being able to see how people are thinking with technology may help in some situations. But the human mind is already programed to tell these certain characteristics about other people, so the use of using technology to help could be quite redundant. Teachers are able to tell of a student isn't enjoying a lesson if the student is either sleeping, yawning, or looking bored. The use of technology to show human emotions can help in some ways for people, but it's not worth using technology for.",1,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Cars that can drive themselves have been a fantasy for many years. They have been seen in movies and shows for quite a while, and many have hopes that someday, it will become a reality. With recent research and new developments, car manufacturers are beginning to actually make driverless cars possible. Altough there are many risks that could take place in the us of driverless cars, I believe that driverless cars should be made and used for everyone in the future.

A driverless car would have dozens of benefits for drivers on the road. Because there would be sensors all around the car that monitor the car's surroundings at all times, there would be almost no crashes. As of now, there are already cars that can drive by themselves, however, if there is a obstacle on the road, it will alert the driver and allow him to take over. When car manufacturers can develop a way for these cars to detect obstacles and manuver around them, the road will a much safer place, and car crashes would almost become nonexistent. When everyone has a driverless car, there would not even be chance to have a crash, unless nature gets involved, since each car is on a course that is monitoring the road at all times. Not only would there be fewer car crashes due to collisions, but there would also be no more speeding or reckless driving from unresponsible or inexperienced drivers.

Two of the main causes of car crashes today is the act of texting while driving and drinking while driving. If the car drives itself, then there would be no more distracted drivers that don't have their eyes on the road. A driverless car would allow the person in the drivers seat to focus on other things. When they develop cars that won't need a driver under circumstances, the person in the car may become bored, due to the lack of the thrill while driving. To solve this issue, these driverless cars would have in-car entertainment that would allow the owner of the car to not become bored. Another big benifit of driverless cars would be that they would use half the amount of gas and therefor not only saving the earth's limited amount of gas, but also saving people tons of money.

As stated, I strongly believe that they use of driverless cars should become a reality in the future and that everyone should use them. This would further increase everyones safety on the road and lead to fewer injuries and crimes. Not only would driverless cars benefit others by helping them achieve their destination safely, but also by saving the earth's amount of gas and saving people's money.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Driverless cars, the way of the future? More like stay in the dream world! I think the idea of a driverless car is ridiculous at this point in time. Safety issues, misuse/abuse, and new ways of the road. All for the fact people don't want to drive themselves or it will be safer? I don't think so!

I have several reasons why I think driverless cars are pointless. Now, would it be cool to just take a nap and let the car control itself and take you to your destination? Yes, but in that case you would have to have a car that is actually able to drive itself. The cars are said to win people over if and when they are proven safe. The key word there ""when"". Sometime in the future driverless cars may become a big thing but right now they are not ready to be put on the road so I don't even think it is an idea worth proposing to the world.

Driving or asisting? If a car is designed to drive itself going 25 miles per hour or slower where are you going that you are only going 25 miles per hour it can't be very far. Funny thing is you are supposed to be alert just in case an obstacle such as a traffic jam or an accident occurs. How is it ""Driverless"" if there has to be a driver. Why not just drive the car yourself?

That is like having a self filling water bottle but you have to turn on the sink to fill it up. Also the cars would probably be used for people to sleep or just think they can relax while letting the car drive. No that is going to lead to accidents and wih a car thats supposed to be runnig itself whose to blame in an accident and how can you prove who was at fault. Here is wherre new laws would have to come in. To prove whose fault there would have to be a camera in the car recording to insure the driver was alert and it wasn't a manufacturing issue. Then isn't that invading one's privacy? Laws would have to change and there would be so many execptions due to liability and how to prove who is at fault.

I just do not think ""driverless cars"" are necesary especially when they don't own up to their name! Now if people could understand the car is asisting and not driving then i dont feel there would be an issue considering you have to be driving the so called ""driverless car"". We don't have the laws figured out for liability in an accident figured out and since you have to be driving the car I feel like its a useless name to get more attention.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,2,1
"dear state senator, i believe that we should abolish the electoal college and just leave up to populare vote. The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution.

The electoral college is unfair because it takes away the demicratic way of society that our founding fathers set up. In the United States of America we leave it up to the people to vote but if the people of the united states vote someone in an he doesnt get to run the country because the electoral college decided diffrently then we should not be called a democracy. For example in the 2000 election with Al Gore and Gorge W. Bush, the people of the united states voted for Al Gore, but due to the electoral college Bush won the election. in the passage The Indefensible Electoral College it says ""Over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" what does that tell you? more then half of the USA would prefer a people vote instead of both!

Furthurmore, I believe we should due away with the electoral college because it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. when i say this i mean it is a threat to the citizens of the USA. the people of the united states were thought to vote our president in? but if the majority of voters vote for someone an the other oponent wins then where is the domocracy in that? also in the artical The Indefensible Electoral College  says ""oh what if a state sends two slates of electors to congress? it happened in hawaii in 1960. Luckily, vice president Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, vatlidated only his opponent's electors."" imagin if that happens again an someone doesnt notice that? then there will be double slaters an there bound to vote for the same canidate so that will be an easy state to win for that canidate. The electoral college is nothing but problems.

In conclution, The electoral college should be abolished because it is unfair, and it poses a threat to the U.S constitution. You make your conclution based on this Mr. senator",3,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The challenge of exploring Venus seems very difficult but they want to evaluate it more. It is very hard to get really close because it is to hot for a human to get there. The heat can melt or destroy devices and there would be no information. They have sent many spacecrafts on the cloud-draped world and they have not made it, so they don't send humans. There is a lot of harsh condition in Venus like frequent lightning strikes and erupting volcanoes. They say that long ago Venus was probably almost like earth and could have supported various forms of life just like earth today. NASA probably has a way of sending humans to study Venus in a way that they would survive. They say that a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles over venus landscape. With jet airplanes traveling at a higher altitude to go over storms. The vehicle would not be touching the ground so it can avoid the hot ground conditions. The vehicle going at thirty plus miles above surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees Farenheit, with air pressure close to sea level on earth would be hard but humans could survive and get information. They have made electronics of silicon carbide and put them to the test in conditions like venus. They have lasted for three weeks in those conditions. They also have thought of other devices from the 1800s with better mechanical parts to be more resistant. They are working very hard to get close and collect a lot more information about Venus.

"Residents in Vauban, Germany have done the unthinkable; they have given up their cars. It's streets are completely car-free. You can still own a car, but the problem is their is only two places to park: large garages at the edge of the development and where a car-owner buys a garage with a home.

"Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.

Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, I'm talking about all the things i talked about in my paragraphs. I talked about Venus and it's nickname, the amosphere percent, orbiting and hovering and then the NASA.",0,3,3,2,1,2,2,1,1

Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet its beyond high pressure an heat NASA worked on other approaches to study venus they simplified electronics made of silicon carbide it lasted 3 weeks in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus which are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

"If everybody limited car usage, the whole population would save a ton of money. Insead of having to pay for gas, we will be able to pay for more things to provide for ourseleves and our families.

We will be able to walk or bike to all of the stores, work-cites and recreation facilities. It will only take a couple of minutes to get where we would need to be. We wont have to use a highway or interstate to go to the mall or ball field. Also, we will be getting more exercise. By walking and bikinng, we arent sitting and being lazy.

With the driveless car there could be less accidents,because of the sensors and flashing lights in the car,but overall the driveless car still isn't a good idea because there will have to be some sort of binary code on the road for the car to read,with that it would be way to expensive to pratically work .

"There are many benifits of limiting how many times you use your car some are.  Not driving a car can make you less stressed out in life.  Not driving a car can lower pollution in the air dramatically.  Lastly cars arnt as needed as before.  so not driving a car can actully be good for you in the long run.

First of all not driving a car can make you less stressed out in life.""when I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way""(elisabeth roseenthal) by saying this she means that without a car to worry about it has made he less stressed out and much happier as a person.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress said businessman carlos arturo plaza""(andrew selsky) in this article this man says it a good chance to take away stess about worrying about a car, the bills for it, insurance on the car or anything else in that matter.

Second of all not driving a car can help to lower the air pollution around you.  according ro one acrticle they stopped driving an estimate of four thousand cars and has dramaticcaly lowered the amount of smog(greenhouse gas) in there towns air.  so if you stop driving cars it will help to lower the amount of smog in the air of your city or in the community around you.  ""The smog cleared enough monday for the ruling french party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"" in this article one city gave up driving lots of there cars for a while and doing so lowed the amount of smog in the air.

Third of all driving a car is really not needed for many things.  Why drive when you could just walk or ride a bike to where you are going there is really no point in you driving a car now and then.  Not driving but walking also opens more doors for buissness to be put in next to side walks or just in walking distance of your house.

"Have you ever seen an illusion where it looked like a figure, but then you realize it was just something else?

Everyone has had that happen, and that is because your brain is being fooled. Recently, research shows that your brain assumes something when it looks like what you think of. For example, the pop icon, known as the ""Face of Mars,"" has fooled many scientists as NASA, making them believe that aliens were trying to give out signals. Unlike the other scientists, I believe that this ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural landform that looks similar to a human face.

First of all, I believe that this peculiar face was made from the winds on Mars. It is true that when erosion occurs on Earth, tiny sediments of rocks are moved away from the original rock. I believe that erosion also occurs on Mars because a rock that looks like a face does not show up all of the sudden. Also, as you can see in the picture Viking 1 photographed, you can see tiny holes on the forehead of this rock. It is my opinion that this rock was eroded at some time and started to form a figure of a face.

Secondly, the picture resolution of the rock was not as clear as it is today. So because of the resolution, the image looked similar to a human face.

Also, at the time of 1976, scientists still believed in the theory of aliens. However, about 22 years later, the workers at NASA captured the image of the rock again, but this time they used higher resolution. Then scientists were putting it all together by finding out that this rock was not a signal coming from Martians. So because of the resolution of the picture, the sceintists assumed that the rock came from aliens.

However, just because this face-like rock is from aliens doesn't mean that the theory of aliens isn't true.

There are still many beliefs that aliens exist. For example, in 1957, there was a group of aliens coming toward a farmer. However, they left Earth and there were no other signs of aliens from then. Then there was the flying saucer in the sky in 2013.

Many people assumed that it was a UFO, and there are still some research about that incident today. So even though that there was no sign of life on Mars, there has to be life somewhere out in the universe.

In conclusion, people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" still came from aliens. Some people are like me, who believe that the rock was formed from erosion and that scientists didn't have the resolution at the time to figure out that it wasn't really a human face. Overall, the rock was just a mesa on Mars.",2,4,2,3,2,2,2,2,3

In other ways it's not such as an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth.

Venus can sometimes be our neasrest option for a planetary visit, this is crucial considering tha long time frames of space travel. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This getting in the way of spacecraft being able to get around NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions would allow scientists to floar above the fray. Just as our jets and airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earths levels.

Since we can't be on Venus reseachers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. Therefore, they who are seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close despite the risks. They have come up with many ideas such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and they have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Also mechanical computers that make calucaltion by using gears and levers and don't require electronics at all. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resisant to pressure, heat, and other forces.",1,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
"Mars has alot of land forms like cracks,crators,and hills. I am certian it has land formations if it has hills and cracks. Erosion created land forms on earth with wind and rocks falling on each other like a slow chain reaction. It is highly posible for it to have happened on mars may tousands possibly millions of years ago to star erosion. Mars is filed with many resonses for it not to be livable if it were ever consitered apon. It most likely a cluster of dust and bolders than live beings made this face. People see faces in every thing from light sockets to morfed trees. I know the face on the moon is a popular land formation like the ''Grand Canyon''. It be impossible to not try to think aliens did it but there are things here on earth famous we didn't create. I know mars has land forms too.",0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"About venus challenge

People called venusa a "" Every stry""; because it the brigtest light in the night sky. make it esay tp spot it in sky but the name is misleding it a venus is a planet. Venus is are second planent from the sun. So venus is the second hottes planent of the earth.so peopele really live on it. venus is over 800 degrees and fahrenheuil on the surface of venus. Some people say venus is earth twin beacuse venus is closest and it densith and size. beacuse of venus is closest to the sun it speed is little fast then earth.

some people wnat to exlporing venus. while venus is simlpe to seen from the distant but safe vantage pount of the eart, it has proved a very challenging place to eamine more closely. so many thing are happand to venus but what know about if can put pepleo on the planet. what are the challenging we can do want venus. people have sent spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped wprld

beacuse it no spacecraft well survived the landin for more than a few hours. make it hard to get on venus beacuse of the speed and get on time.

venus have geolog and weather prsent. make erupting volcanoes powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes; then earth have. venus is anymose like earth it have mountains, craters and valleys like earth have.

we need to closets to venus to get researchers of venus like rock, gas, and anything. the NASA are try to sending humans to study venus.

"The author is givin a good suggestion about studying Venus , because like myself i dont know that much about Venus and i feel like we should study it. Thats because i feel like we should know about this plannet on are earth no matter how dangerous it is. The author made some good statements about it like Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Even though Mercury is closer to our sun like how is that possible . Also a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. These are all important things i think myself should know and everyoone else who doesnt Venus seems to be a very important plannet on are earth that people barely know about . When we should know about it. Not a single spceship has touched down on Venus in more than 3 decades like why hasnt anyone went there to check it out see if anything has changed see if theres anything new about it thats another reason people should start studying it we dont know anything about this plannet no one has seen in over 3 decades thats a very long time. NASA is the only system working on studying Venus.In the 1800s devices were envisioned, and played a important role in the 1940s during World War11 . All these things we didnt know about Venus because of the danger because no one hasnt seen it in over 3 decades this is all the reasons why i agree with the author.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you think that being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a great opportunity for you? I think it is a great experience for anyone and everyone. Becoming a

Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity because, you get to help many people that are in need, see lots of the world and have great experiences, and it is lots of fun.

Becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the best thing I ever did. I got to help many people. When you get to the different places, you see how you can really make a difference with what you are doing. It really made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs. This is only one reason becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is a great opportunity.

Another reason you should become a Seagoing Cowboy is that you get to see and experience lots of the world. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, on my nine trips, I got to see many parts of Europe and China. The most special parts of my trips were seeing the Acropolis in Greece, and taking a gonola ride in Venice, Italy. When you join the Seaging Cowboys, you will get to see much of the world like I did.

The last reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program is it is lots of fun, especially after the animals have been unloaded.

It's not just working with animals, feeding, and watching over them. You have lots of fun playing games like baseball, volleyball, and boxing. You have lots of down time with the long trips there and back, and not having to care for animals on the way home after they are unloaded. It is a lot of fun being a Seagoing Cowboy!

Now are you thinking participating in the Seaging Cowboys program? It is a great opportunity and experience for anyone who wants to join. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys is a great opportunity because, you get to help many people that are in need, see lots of the world and have great experiences, and have lots of fun. You really should join the Seagoing Cowboys.",2,4,3,3,2,1,1,1,3
"I am mainly for the idea of driverless cars because of many reasosn that I will exolain in this open space.

One of the reasons I am for it is because it will help the envirorment, like think of how much polluted air we can terminate with this product.

Another reason I support this idea is because it will more than likely cause less wrecks.

I mean we might be overpopulated in the future, but think of how many people were depressed of the loss of a loved on.

I'm pretty sure car crashes are the number one cause of deaths in America.

Think of how much manyt people would have given to see a loved one again, even if it's for just one last time; I know I would give up a lot.

The only thing I dislike about this product is that they will follow the speed limit.

I know this sounds like a

crazy thing for me to be saying especially after I said that""I know I would give up a lot"".

However imagine if someone got out of their car and tried to hurt you, but you were at a red light and your car would not move because it follows all the safety rules that it should.

Although that is great and all.

Let's face it if that ever happend you would get seriously hurt, or maybe even murdered.

"The author supports studying venus is a worthy pursuit even though it has a lot of dangers because, by us doing that we will get a lot of imformation that we've always wondered about. Also just learning a lot more about venus will be really cool. Venus is a very special planet and we should get to know a little more baout her. We know Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and has valleys and mountains but do we know if there is life on earth? Or even plants? No, because we haven't took the time to actally sit down and make up a plan to figure that out.

As the article states, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insigh to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond ahould not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

After that being said I think you get the point. Just because something is risky doesn't mean we still can't do it or find another way. What I mean by this is like maybe have some trial runs with different machines. Sending them up there to Venus to make sure it's safe to go up there or even just scopping it out to see what all is up there. Going deep down into venus and just exploring. All of this can be done, it will take some time but never. say. never.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There have been many claims out there that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. This idea seem very crazy since aliens don't exist. I think the that the Face is just a natural landform.

On May 24, 2001, the day the face was discovered, people said that the Face resembled a humans face, not an alien. A few days later NASA unveiled images for everyone to see while captioning it ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The landform was just formed by shadow, which means this just gives others the illusion that it's a face, but it is just a natural landform. There were no alien to create this and it is only made naturally. Many out there have created movies, books and magazine article on the Face but this is all just bandwagon, trying to just sell their products and make money out of false theories. Later on, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew to Mars to take more photgraphs of the Face, when thousands of people were waiting for the end result to confirm that the Face was just a natural landorm. Since people were'nt satified, Mars Global Surveyor flew back to Mars in April of 2001. With many photos take, the Face did indeed look like a human or alien face, but there are no sitings of such things.

In conclusion, all the Face really is is just a naturally created landform with shadows that create the illusion of a face of a human/alien.",2,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,0

Venus is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth,venus, and mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and other times to venus.

"Dear, to Miami senator. Americans should change election by popular vote for the president of the United State. The Electoral College it's not a good thing that is helping the citizens to express thier own thoughts in political. In Electoral College it's not really voting for the president it's for a slate of electors that turns elect the president. This shows that we the ""People"" that have the right to vote who we believe to be the leader for United States we are not really choosing him.

Additional, "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer shows "" the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational"". This can explain the Electoral College is ""unfair to voters because the winner take all system in each sate"" that means candidates can't spend time in each state getting their chance to win thier vote from the state for the next four years. However, electoral college ""avoids the problem of elections in which no candiate receives a majority of the votes cast"" shown in "" In defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the preseident"" by Richars A. Posner. This can help the candiates to not be a tied so the Electoral College reduced and thiers a clear winner. What if their was a tied would citizens like a machine take thier decision on who's going to be the leader of the United States ? I don't think so becasue a machine doesn't have a right to vote.

In therefore, in 2000 Al Gore lost the presidency but won the popular vote. ""Over 60 percenet of voters would prefer a direct election ... this year voters can expect the popular vote win could again lose the presidency"" explain Plumer. This wasn't the voters decision was the Electoral College we should't have something that doesn't express our right of speech in political. However, the Electoral Collge ""process consists of the slection of the electors, they vote for President and Vice President"" this shows that the citizens can vote to be the most faithful President to be the leader on this opportunity land. To end, we shouldn't keep something that it's not really showing the voice of each citizens on this wonderful world we have as Ameica.

To conclude, we should change election by popular vote for the president of the United States. If we have a tie in the elctoral vote, ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president "" this explain we the citizens didn't chose the president would you like the citizens get mad a make a protest to chose the president ? American would like that so please senator take out the Electoral College becasue you never know if one day the citizens get as one to protest to get rid off the Electoral collge with their power of speech.",2,3,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Dear Senator:

Over the years, people have been disputing over the Electoral College. Some people want it abolished while others want it to stay. The Electoral College is not working and and it needs to be abolished. For many reasons, the Electoral College has not worked. It is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates.

The Electoral College is unfair to the voters. According to source 2, :""Voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" The whole point of voting is so that you, along with many people, can decide who will be the next president! Voting for people to elect a president is just not right. It causes voters to not vote because they know that their vote really won't matter. Source 2 also states that candidates don't spend time in small states, ""focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" That is causing smaller states like Rhode Island and South Carolina to have less knowledge on the candidates. If I didn't know too much about a candidate, I wouldn't vote at all! Even though people in those states did vote, they might not have known a lot about the candidates and voted for the wrong person.

The people running for office want to win. Source 3 says that someone could have a higher popular vote but lose the election. Is that fair to the candidate? Winning the popular vote but losing the election? No, it isn't. Winning the popular vote means that more people want you in office. If the majority of America wants a certain person to be the president of their country, that means that the winner of the election would be the majority vote. The Electoral College denys that basic right of Americans by not letting them choose their president. That alone is unfair to the candidates and to the voters.

Now you might be saying that the Electoral College has worked for a very long time and shouldn't be changed. Although the Electoral College has been working for a long time, that is the only thing that America has tried. If America used the popular vote, it could've changed elections. The Electoral College hasn't been working because it is causing more and more voters to stop voting and it is making it where only the majority vote doesn't matter. Citizens of America should have the right to chose the president by majority vote.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is unfair to the voters, it causes voters to not vote, and it is unfair to the candidates. As an American citizen, you have the right to vote. The Electoral College is taking that away and it needs to be stopped.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME",3,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2
"This article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", should prove to anyone who reads it that the idea of driverless cars should not become an all out reality. The technology is simply not there and even in the future when our civilization is far more advanced, it is so easy for a mistake to be made in the manufacturing of these cars. Also, as humans, we would not cope well with having driverless cars. After years of getting used to them, they would be taken much better but in the begining it would simply be too hard for everyone to stay focused while at the wheel. Therefore, driverless cars, while very advanced, should not be manufactured.

The technology part of this project alone is enough for anyone to object. Cars are already dangerous enough with many people getting in accidents every day. These things could already easily kill a person, without putting all of this very sensitive technology into it. To make driverless cars happen, there would have to be a ridiculis amount of intricate technology worked into the car, and if one thing messes up, who's to say how much damage can be done? Putting all of our attention into our phones is one thing, but to put our lifes in the hands of a machine is much more of a risk.

Even if the technology worked, it would still need some sort of human control at first. Many humans can barely pay attention to the road when they are the only ones driving let alone when they are waiting for their turn to drive. Say, a driver has a particularly hard night and happens to fall asleep in the car on his way to pick up his child. If the warnings don't wake him up, this tiredness could cost many lives. This could result in lawsuits filed against the car manufacturer and others starting to fight and protest. Even in the article it asks, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer"" (Paragraph 9)? This would be a tough situation to make laws on and a dificult thing to prove if the driver claims the technology failed. How would it be proven? People can barely handle driving now with the new technolgy that they have, and adding more would just make things more dangerous.

Driverless cars should not be manufactured. The technology that we have now is already making life more dificult in general, and adding to it would do less good than bad. There aren't even any claims to why it would be a benificial thing to our society. The reason for that is that it won't be benificial. Car manufacturers are doing it just for the sake of doing it and it could potentially be a very dangerous thing.",3,3,1,2,1,2,2,1,2
"My position on the tohught of these are is very obvious. These cars can be very helpful and useful/entertaining to our communities. Lets Say for example you are

a truck driver whom has to drive home from the truck docking location. well truck drivers work long and painful shifts so this car would be helpful because it could help him get home and he could possibly nap on the way home. Heres another example, when you and your friends want to go out and party friday night, you will always need a designated driver. You preplan where you need to go afterwards, so you cna program the car to take you to 123 apple street. so you guys wont get poulled over for DUI and go to jail. Cars like these are a life saver honestly. This car can be a pain reliever or a life saver. people will disagree with my metohds but these are full-blown facts. If you whine because you have to pay a few extra dollars for something that can help the community then there is something wrong with you. I would rather pay taxes to geto ne of these cars than pay traxes for someone to patrol our city and take drunk drivers to jail for DUI. its a better way to save money. Its fair to say that technology has almost taken over. if it wasnt for technology then we would still be living like cavemen because not one single person would invented the car or the wheel or a farm to do anything.

"On May 24,2001 NASA vikings 1 spacecraft was circling mars and snapped a photo of a strange human like face on mars. It just so happens its not actually a face. Scientists discovered that the face on mars was just a natural landform. Some people think aliens created the ""face"" on mars.

However, aliens did not create the face on mars. The face was a natural landform, scientists did tons of research on this face. At first the scientists thought the face on mars was just another Martian mesa. Once this face was captured on camera a few days later NASA revealed the face they took a picture of on mars. The face then was starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines and even radio talk shows.

When the scientists were researching the face on mars, like i said they thought it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people make ridiculous assuotions, like how they think aliens created this face on mars, even though there can be human life on mars but those are just theorys people are making. Which is when everyone starts amking these assuptions and even make it look belivable that aliens could have possible made the ""face on mars"".

So aliens did not create this human like face on mars it was mostly just consquently mistaken to be one becuase it really is just huge rocks together just so happening to look like a face.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Did you ever think in your wildest dreams that you can be in a car with no driver? Well that may become a reality very soon. I believe that the idea for a self driving car can cause a lot of problems from who is responsible in a crash to how can the manufactures make the cars as safe as possible. There are three main ideas that may have you thinking next time you get behind the wheel. Those are how the cars need someone inside when driving, how they might not need someone inside in the future and how they can signal a passanger to assest f something were to go wrong.

The self-cars most likely need a driver today because of road blocks, construction, or any road problems that might cause the car to crash and not be able to manuver out of the way of the obsticals. The cars also need a driver because if the manufacures were to put the self driving car on the market then not a lot of people will buy it from it costing too much or they just think it's ridiculous. Also if a driver were to crash into a self-driving car and there was no-one in the driver seat then there would be some problems like how the driver would say that it was the cars fault just to get some extra money from the car company.

There also might be a way to alert the driver on stand-by to assest the car. If the car has a DVD player or televison screen and if there is an accentident about to happen, then the car can either shut down the devise or flash on the screen about the danger. The driver might be able to gain control over the situation. Also, if the driver does not have a screen and is using a cell phone as entrainment, then there could be lights instaled under the rear-view mirror and can flash when sensors detect danger.

Now lets say that it is a decade or two from the inital launch of the driving car and about everyone has one. then maybe there wil be no reason for a driver to be present when driving. There are some cars out there with sensors around it to tell the driver to move out of the way of an incoming car. Well I believe that it is possible to have it to where the sensors tell the computer on board the vechicule to move out of the way, eleminating the middle man. Also if there is road constuction then there might be a way to tell all of the cars about it so that they know about where to go and how to get around it.

I believe that it is possible to have a self driving car but it will take a long time. There will be trail and error along side it. But I believe that it is possible, from all of the technical advancements that have been accomplished over the years, i dont see a problem with a self driving car.",2,2,0,2,1,1,1,2,1
"The Face on Mars

Have you heard about the Face on mars? Well if you haven't the Face is a picture Nasa took on Mars, this figure looks like a humans face. People agure that's possibly aliens did this, others agure that it's just part of the

natural landmark on Mars. I believe that it's just part of the landform and that aliens have nothing to do with the Face.

I believe that the Face is just part of natural landform, because there is no proof that aliens are even real. in the article it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing..... a natural lanmark. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face has nothing to do with aliens. Some people believe that the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on mars- evidence that Nasa would rather hide. I would say that there no reason why Nasa would lie and cover up the truth if something is living in Mars. If there were somthing that cause the Face, Nasa would of revealed it, because they would get more money. Once nasa went to take the picture again in April '98 it was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. Skeptics still didn't believe Nasa that the Face was just natural landform. They argured that perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Although Nasa knows there is no proof that aliens excist so we can't predict that aliens have something to do with the Face. After all people have different opinion on this.

There will still be people who believe it just a natural landform and others that think it has to do something with aliens. I still agree with Nasa that the Face is just part of the land on Mars. If some type of creature lived there then we would of discovered it by know. Back then we might not have had all the technology, but by now we would of discovered if someing was living on Mars. For now people will keep discussing their opinions on the Face.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"From my opinion I think this is one of the best technologys I ever heard about. I think this technology would be a great use for students and should be allowable at schools to read the students emotional expressions. If this technology can be worked by students then it is most definitley I would love to work with this technology. I am pretty sure more students would work with this technolgy and have fun with it. And when I saying if students can work on it, I mean by making a class for this technology and have the class make more brilliant ideas and make more technololgy like this emotional reader. That is why I think this technology should be allowed at schools for the use of students and also teachers.

In schools we have many classes like Math, English, History and etc. But it would be nice to have a class about technology and have this technology in the class so students can learn how to use it and how it was made. Time bye time the students are going to know more of this technology and then this could work for the help of many students. Once they come in to class if you see them in a different mood the teacher can either send you to the office or she can do it her self to see what type of emotional expression does the student have. So this machine would be very good and it would help the school a lot with their students.

With this type of technology it would tell us what the other person is feeling or what were they thinking if we know. Like we can get a picure of Abraham Lincoln and we can read how he was when they took the picture. Not just with Abraham Lincoln but with everybody in the old age that has an original picure or painting of themselves. It would be very cool to see what they were feeling. And I am pretty sure whoever invented this machine would make a ton of money if he tells the world what he has created.

So like I said in the beginning, this is probably the best technology I ever heard about before either then the technolgy apple. This technology would be a great use for students at their schools. Not just for students but for teachers too and maybe they can have this technology at jobs and other places. Me personally if I had this technology I would use it every time I wake up and evety time I go to bed so I would know how my day went. And finally this is why I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom shoud be valuable.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"We should explore venus and three ressons why are that people can not survive the landing, and the air is 97% carbon dioxide, and lastly the enviorment is really hot too hot that people can not be able to live on.

And one resson that we sould start to explore venus is that people can not survive the landing to venus and a quot from the text is ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" and that proves we need to start exploring venus because it shows us our mistakes in our space craft. Just think of how we will be able to improve our studys in space exploration. And we can upgrade our spaceships to spacecrafts maybe.

And anouther reson on why we need to keep exploring mars is how there is 97% of carbon dioxide in the ai. and one pice of evidence from the text is ""A thick atmoshere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. "" And that is anouther reson to keep studdying mars, because we can learn how is was created and how it got there and also how long people live there before they die so many posibilatys that we can have about gasmask and air chambers.

And lastly the final reson on why we shouldn't end the venus exploration is that the heat the planet has. and one piece of evidnce that the text gives us about on hot venus is, is "" on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees fhrenheit"" and that shows us that we can learn on how to live on hot planets without buring into a crips also it shows us how far we can go with our air coolers to try to lower the heat.

And that is all the ressons why we should not stop exploring venus.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Students can feel various different types of emotions throughout the school day. School can be very stressful and overwhelming yet so enjoyable at the same time. When students are feeling a certain way, it may affect their ablity to learn. By incorporating the use of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom, teachers or even the computers themsleves could alter the learning style of the information being taught, making it customized and fitting for a specific student based on their emotions.

Everyone is different when it comes to learning. Some students may be visual learners where as some students may be auditory learners. There are numerous, unique differences spanning from individual to indivdual which makes it hard on teachers when trying to teach a group of students the same material. The use of the Facial Action Coding System would make the job easier on teachers and prove helpful for students. For example, if a teacher could not visually recognize that one of thier students was tired, they may continue on with the way they are teaching the information, and that particular student may not grasp the concept being taught. With the Facial Action Coding System, the teacher would be able to recognize the students emotions and would have the opprotunity to alter her teaching method to somehting more engaging for the student. This would also prove helpful for the student that was feeling tired becasue they would now be able to become engaged with a modified style of learning.

If the Facial Action Coding System recognized that the students appeared to be happy and engaged, this could guide the teacher to continue teaching in that particular style and it would benefit the students trying to learn. Another way that this new technology could prove valuble in the classroom is if students were doing work on their computer or other elctronic device. If the Facial Action Coding System was installed into the learning devices that the students are using, the device itself could alter the learning style of the information given to fit the students needs. Even Dr. Haung, a professor at Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a sudent is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Huang).

The Facial Action Coding System would prove to be valube and helpful in many ways when incorporated in the classroom. The use of this technology would allow teachers and electronic teaching devices to enhance their learning styles to attend to all different types of students. Often times teachers forget that some individuals learn differently than others and only focus thier course in one direction. This new form of technology could serve as a reminder to teachers that students vary in learning styles but could also account for those differences among students.",4,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Driverless cars are coming. They might be reality in a few years maybe a few months. That is a scary thing to think about. Yes the cars provide help to drives, but they also have a few problems that take over the positive qualities.

The cars can be good. For example, in paragraph two, Goolges cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. That is amazing. A car can driven that long by driving itself. Another good thing is in paragraph one, how the cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. if the cars use half the fuel of today's taxis, then their is more money to pave new roads, make better buildings, or develop a plan that helps every one in need.

This idea of driverless cars has been around for a while. Google only made that idea a reality just a few years ago. There has been inventions that made the driverless cars closer to a reality. ""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brack,"" (paragraph 5). Ten years later, those sensors had develop into a more advanced, which aloud it to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids and rollovers. If those sensors are in the driverless car that google made, then they might save some lives.

Even though, the driverless cars have good qualities, it haves some okay ones. For example, in paragraph seven, how it takls about the special touch sensors make suyre the drive keeps hold of the wheel. What if the drive is asleep becuase they passout or just tired and their hands fall out the wheel, how will the sensors work then? What if the car is approaching a work zone or it is around any accident and the drive is passed out, will the car brake itself or will is just keep driving. lets save the car brakes itself to fast and the driver bangs his or her head against the wheel, the drive could get a concussion, or even worst, die. If the car keeps driving, it could drive to fast and rare-end that car infront of it or hint one of the workers. Then who would take the blame the drive who passed out or the driverless car. The driver did not know he or she was going to pass out.

Driverless cars are coming. Yes, the cars have good qualities that mkae then safe. for example, the seats vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into an object (paragraph seven). Although, like everything else in this world, it has a few mistakes and question that have been answered yet. I am not for driverless cars becasue of the question that still have no answers. I am the type of person who thinks of the ""what ifs"", mostly the bad what ifs instead of the good. So, I can make up questions that have not been thought of nor answered. Driverless car are coming. We already have the technology for them, someone, like Google, just has to put the technology and the idea together to make the product.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,0
"Venus has had a lot of research put into it . they ave put spacecrafts of many kinds on it ,but they can not last on there for more then a few hours. some belive it is because ofthe high heats on that plant ,also it might be because of the pressure in the air and it messes with the craft. scientest are still not 100% sure as to what it is quiet yet.

Earth and Venus are a like in some ways. they are the closest alike within all the plants in the solar system . they both have large bodys of ocean on them and creatures on them . NASA wants to maybe someday have someone land on Venus ,but that would be way to dangerous becasue of the heat . also venus has almost no oceans anymore . another thing is that they have really thick and heavy clouds on them and that may harm them.

NASA is testing diffrent types of spacecrafts and putting the min chambers that are simaloar to Venus . some last up to a few minties till a few weeks for others . it all just depends on how it is made. a lot o fpeople are fasanated by venus and how are solar system works . because venus and earth are so close to each other but venus has such high temputures and it is weird because earth is not like that. another thing is sometimes earth is closer to mars then it is to venus , because of how the earth moves.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do think that we should have a Facial Action Coding System for everyone. You could use it for so many things. Sometimes you could be in a situation for someone and you wnat to know how they are actually feeling. This would also be a very helpful tool cause you wouldn't have to use it on just paintings you could use it on humans too! You could also probably use it on yourself.

It would be so much easier to tell how people are feeling with this. Sometimes people get annoyed at others so this can tell you to either leave them alone or stop what you are doing. You could use other emotions as well like if someone is feeling down you could do something to make them happy. If you where doing an essay on renaissance paintings this could help with that. To me some renissance painting look like they are showing no emotion at all. Then with this tool you could know how they afre feeling more and you can understand the painting more.

This is such a good tool. I hope that they can let the world experiene it. I know it would be helpful for some of the people that I know including myself.",1,3,0,2,1,0,0,0,1

"Do voters some times get confused about the electers and vote for the wrong candidate? The single best argument against the electoral is what we might call a disaster facter. We the people should consider ourselves lucky to vote. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votesthe winner. If the advocates of this position is correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . It is the electers who elect the president, not the people . It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. yet this has happened very rarely when Gore had more popular votes then Bush . It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a canadidate who has no hope of carrying their state . And not having everyone vote mite throw things off too. but of courseno voters  vote swings a national election, and in spite of that about one -half the eligible American population did vote in 2012 's election.

"A car is considered by many a nessecity for everyday life; however, limited usage of our cars has many positive advantages. Emissions from cars create greenhouse gasses, which are detrimental to our enviroment, and limiting the use of our cars can greatly cut down these emissions. Also, many people say that using alternant modes of transportation cut down on the stress they expireinced whilst using a car. In fact, many people are no longer conserned with cars, and young people are begining to stop getting liscenses.

The smog, which is caused by car emissions, in Paris, France was so intense that the city had to place a partial ban on drivers. Those with even number plates faced a fine if they drove on Monday; and, on Tuesday those ith odd number plates would face the same fine if they drove. The ban was so successful in cutting down the smog that the ban was lifted in time for those with odd number plates to drive unrestricted on Tuesday.( source 2) Paris isn't the only city to place bans on driving, in Bogota, Columbia one day a year the city celebrates the 'Day Without Cars'. The idea of this day is to help reduce smog and has even caught on in Cali and Valledupar, also in Columbia.( source 3)

Vauban, Germany makes owning a car unappealing to residents by only allowing two places to park and creating a city plan that facilitates alternative modes of transportation. Many of the residents as a result dont own cars and are happier this way! ""When I had a car I was always tense. Im much happier this way,"" said resident Heidrun Walter. Cities like Vauban are result of a growing trend in Europe called smart planning, which seprates auto use from suburban life.(source 1) People all around the world also feel positive after limited car use. During the Day Without Cars in Columbia Carlos Arturo Plaza states that the day is "" A good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (source 3)

In 2013 the average miles driven per American was down 9% from the peak of car usage. This may because the Internet allow people to feel connected or possibly because many center cities renewal have made the suburbs less appealing. Whatever the reason, one things for sure, there has been a substancial drop in the amount of 16- to 39-year- olds getting a liscence. (source 4) America isnt the only place to expierence a drop in car usage. Vauban, Germany makes owning a car impractical and 57% of families sold their cars to live there, while 70% dont own cars. (source 1)

Limiting car usage has positive effects on the enviroment and has shown effective at lowering stress in people. Globally many are already starting to realize adavantages of cutting back on car usage. So while a car may seem like a nessecity, keep the advantages in mind.",3,3,3,3,0,1,2,2,2
"I think that it's a Martian mesa. I think that its a just a bunch of rocks put together. If there was life there, it would probally be something else instead of the face. If there was life on mars we would have probably meet them by now and probaly do an invation. We would have found them by now if they was life.

"Google's driverless cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. With something this innovative and exciting there are going to be people who question the safety. There are always going to be those people who try to find every thing that can go wrong, it may seem unfair but it is necessary for our safety. Driverless cars are the future.

Safety? Everyone wants to know how safe they are and how reliable they are. Many people have developed semi-driverless cars. In fact Google ""has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditons since 2009"". The key words are ""specific conditions"". No one has developed a car that is fully driverless. That may be a good thing. Cars are machines, machines malfunction.

Google has modified a Toyota Prius to be semi-driverless equipped with ""position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"". It seems very prepared for whatever could happen.

The cars that have been developed still need a driver. What's the point of having a driverless car, when you still need a driver? Some people who don't fully trust the concept, like me, need some control. That's why some manufacturers are ""bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays"" to alert the driver when he/she needs to take over. Many manufacturers have developed an alert system, GM ""has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object"". Some others include a simple announcement and flashing lights.

The law has also made it hard to develope these driverless cars. What would happen if someone was to wreck in a driverless car? Would it be the driver's fault or the car's? No one has worked out the details yet. Most states don't even let you test driverless cars. The ""traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driverin control at all times"". Once they prove that the cars are more ""reliably safe"" the other states will join in testing driverless cars.

It won't happen for awhile but driverless cars are our future. They have developed the necessary things to keep us safe and keep the car aware. There are still some kinks to work out, like the law. But many car manufacturers like Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan have planned to release semi or fully driverless cars in the future.",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3

"Car-free Cities

In Germany there is a city called VAUBAN and the citizens in that city have been told not to use their cars. There is a law that forbids the citizens to have a car or to use one. If you have a car then you have to put it in a large parking garage which costs 40,000 dollars. So 70% of residents dont have a car and 57% sold their car in oreder to move there. There are also other cities/countries like Paris, Bogota, and the United Stated of America who want to be car-free.

Paris is being polluted by cars which is making the air fog up. So in order to regain control of the air, they have to ban cars temporarily. On mondays cars with even numbered license plates were commanded to to leave their cars at their house or get a 31 dollar fine. The uneven numbered license plates would get the same fee the next day. 4,000 people were fined for driving on the wrong day. Since the banning of the cars, Paris was down 60% of smog/fog.

A program in Bogota,Columbia insists that the citizens be car-free. It has been three years since they have banned cars with only public transportation allowed. It has reduced smog severly and has increased finances in local shops and sports stores. Being car-free has created more oppurtunities for the government and the city.

The United States is getting more polluted every year. the use of cars have been decreasing in use because eberyone is using public transportation in order to get to one point to the other. Teenagers have stopped getting their drivers license right when they turn 16. They usually dont make it the number 1 thing to do on their to-do list. Gas prices have also been getting higher so people are using their cars less frequently becuase of not having enough money.

Being car-free has its advantages and its disadvantages. Less pollution equals a better life for everyone and everything.  People need the exercise and the movement of the body to get to one place or another. But it takes a longer to time to get from point A to point B. Using a car makes things easier and faster but hurts the environment. So being car-free is the best way to go.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear State Senator, I send you this letter to bring up an issue that is often debated amongst us Americans. Should we kee the Electoral College? No! The electoral college just doesn't work anymore and we have seen that in the past. You probably ask yourself what is wrong with the Electoral College? The problem with the Electoral College is that it is unfair, it doesn't rely on what the people say and it can sometimes really make the public mad.

The Electoral College is really unfair, especially for voters. We vote for who WE want, not for some other guy to say what we want. Voters want THEIR voice to be heard when they vote not someone else's. When we vote for a presidential candidate we want to vote directly for who we are voting, we want to pick who we want directly. In source 2 the article explains how the Electoral College works. The author says ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What this means is that when you voted for Obama you didn't vote for Obama , you voted for a group of people to vote for who they wanted. So your voice was not heard. Don't you find that unfair to the voters and to the candidates?

Everytime one person votes for a certain presidential candidate, they are basically ignored. The President should be chosen by the people! And at the moment the President is being chosen by politicians who will ""represent"" us and repeat what we say although that has been proven to not always be true. Passage 2 reminds us of the incidence in the 2000 election in which Al Gore lost the presidency to George W. Bush by electoral votes, even though he had more inividual votes. This proves that our state representatives will not always represent us how we want them to, but how they want to represent us. This is the reason why voters need a direct voice from them to picking their leaders. We should pick what we want not what some politicians want. You are probably saying that these incedents do not happen very often, as said in source 3. The article says ""...it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000...but that was the first time since 1888"" This says that situations like this are very rare, yet it is still possible. Even so, wouldn't you rather the people be heard rather than a politician that claims to represent his state?

So many people got mad in 2000 when they just chose the president most people didn't want. There's many ways to make us Americans mad and this is just another one of those ways. In the United States you are supposed to be able to choose what you believe to be right. If you want to choose what you think should be the future's right president then you should be able to pick him and not have to expect anyone's approval or opinion on your vote. You should be able to walk out from the voting center and say

I voted for this guy. Eventually keeping the Electoral College will only cause more problems, because as time goes on the human develops its opinion futher and creates and spreads new ideas meaning that there will be more people picking different things. If you think that what you are picking should be picked you should be able to say ""I want that"" and not have to through the bother knowing that a politician may have chosen what you DON'T want. If you want to make Americans mad, then keep the Electoral College.

In conclusion I think that the Electoral College be removed and the use of popular vote be put into effect because the Electoral College is unfair, it does not reply on what the public says and it makes the Americans mad. Please take this letter into consideration.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"In this article the author tells us about Venus. He tells us that it is called the ¨Evening Star¨, that it is known as Earths ¨twin¨, and then he explains the attempts made to study and learn more about the planet. He also explains how those attempts were unsucsessful and that the planet is dangerous. But, despite the dangers he has presented to us, he explains that it is worth the danger. I dont personaly believe he did the best job explaining why he believed so and he definitly did not convince me to think the same.

The author never truely explained his claim that he thought exploring Venus was worth the risks and complications. For most of the artical he rambles on telling us about and explaining what was already found out about the planet. He never gave reasoning for believing we sould follow threw with trying to learn more about the planet. He only breifly told us his claim in the last paragraph, paragraph 8. It reads, ¨Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.¨ He tells us that all we will get from risking our lifes is insite on a dangerous planet that we may not even have use for, and he states that we will be faced with more and or equally intimidating endeavors. It may just be my opinion but that does not seem like very convincing or valid reasons for putting lifes in danger.

I truely believe that the author of the artical, ¨The challenge of Exploring Venus¨ did not support his claim and what he believed very well let alone at all. All he gives us is two reasons that are not very valid and did not back them up or tell us why those reasons make a good point and sould make us think the same way. He did not tell us why we needed the information so badly that we should risk our lifes or even make the effort. I do not belive the author supported the idea or really stated his claim or what he belived. He needs more reasoning and explaining of what we would gain from this and how it would benifit us. He also would need more supporting details of what we need the information for and why.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,2,1
"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because in the reading, in paragraphs 2,3, and 4, talk about how Venus is relateable to Earth and that Venus is right next to Earth. In paragraph 2, it talks about how the density and heat of Venus and how there were some spacecrafts that have been sent to Venus, but have only lasted for a short-time. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" (paragraph 2, sentence 5.

In paragraph 3, it talks about how the heat is so intense that in the third sentence it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince in our own planet.""

In paragraph 4, they relate how Earth is similar to Venus, and how they thought that maybe Venus was our long, long, long, time ago planet. In sentnce 2,3, and 4, state this, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once havee been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""

So with all of this being said, I personally feel that Venus is worthy to study on, and who knows, maybe in our future lives, we may even have some type of opportunity to go and have a visit. All of this really fascinating because I didn't know that Venus is really hot. Even if Venus is dangerous is some way or another, those dangers will go away soon and to give NASA a chance to actually land on Venus. The reason I also personally think it's a great idea to keep on studying Venus, is because at some point in the future, plants or stars, or something will disappear and this might be the only opportunity we have.",2,2,3,1,0,1,1,0,1
"I firmly believe that technology like this would greatly improve schools all across the nation. Statistics show that students who tend to be more bored or confused in class, dont do so well in school.

The passage stated that ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto paragraph 3). That explains how incredibly smart the FACS machine is. If it can recognize the emotions of a painting that was made hundreds of years ago, then it can definetly tell the emotions of the students in todays age.

Another great reason why this machine would be greatly appreciated is because it could improve your daily mood. The passage stated that ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on you screen, a similar might follow. But if you frown, the next add will be different"" (D'Alto paragraph 6). With that statement, it shows that the FACS machine will be able to collect you emotions and then show you something different to improve that current emotion.

"As you may know, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, which is a even number. As said in ""The defenseof the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing President,"" that even number can be a result of a tie in electoral votes, but is highly unlikely. But even then it is unfair to those who ""like"" the system, where as I oppose the votig system. Like everyone, I have my reasons;1) 'Electoral college is a disaster factor' 2)  Voters don't vote for the President, but the electors instead.

To begin with my first reason, that electoral college is disaster factor as said in ' The indefensible of the Electorial College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' the system had a fiasco, as you may call it, back in the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a centuary. Also in 1960, segregationist in Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing Democratic Electors whith electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so that the popular vote wouldn't have gone to Kennedy. What else has hepened in the 1960s? As you may or may not know, Vice President Richard Nixon, validated only his opponet's electors. With this, the Electoral College has flaws or loopholes making it a disaster factor.

As for my second reason, that the electorial collge is unfair to voters. Electors may not always be faithful to their party, as said in ' The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong' electors could vote for another canidate if they refused to vote for their party's canidate. Meaning that if a voter votes for a certain elector to vote for a certain President, then their votes probably wouldn't count. Also, because of the winner-takes-all system, candidates do not spend time in states that the are aware that they have no chance of winning them over, but focusing on the 'swing' states. For example, in the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see canidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. Candidates shouldn't just avoid states that they have no chance in, but take that chance.

Even though the Electoral College is unfair and a disaster factor, it also fair in the state department. Smaller states votes area as equal as a bigger states votes, and the electorial college requires a presidental candidate to have a trans-reagional appeal which makes sure that  a candidate doesn't just go to a ragion that he knows he will get votes from, but to others that will allow him to gain more voters.

So in conclusion to my knowledge, the  Electoral College voting system should be changed for so that the system wouldn't be disfuntional and unfair to voters. Which will make electing a president functional and fair to voters.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,0

In the article it says that Luke Bomberger and his friend Don joined this program that makes you a ""Seagoing Cowboy"" n this programs has you help recover countries food supplies animals and also have you take care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

"A lot of people don't know that this techonolgy nowadays could determine the way you feel, it could determine the emotions that peope feel. It also shows the emotions or feelings of others. People probably think that this some type of joke or laugher kind of way when its not there really is techonology nowadays that could detect it. There's probably many ways people can detect to read the emotional expressions of students. Some ways that you probably didn't even know of.

A lot of people wonder how this works they don't really know that one easy way to show emotion or to show how you feel is by looking at them and looking at their actions. Once you have already seen them and that they are feeling some kind of way that's when you realize that there is something going on or that their sad or happy or that they are just going through stuff. People know that by the facial expressions on their face. They say that us as humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"". Some people struggle or have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,sad,etc. This would be one easy way students can detect emotions.

Parents probably disagree about using technology when showing their emotions. Not just parents but maybe some students wouldn't like it either but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement. As you can see its so easy to see their emotions or how they feel. They even show different weighting of units.

The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad.

In my opinion parents and students should get the idea of using techonology its way easier to detect peoples emotions instead of just guessing or thinking you know how they feel. They shouldn't have a problem trying to make the place better.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Dear State Senator jan,28 2015

I'm not in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing the election by popular vote for the president of the united states because i've been informed that when we vote for our candidate, we are actually voting for our candidate's electors. the electoral college is a process, not a place. Our founding fathers had established this in the constitution as a comprise between election of the president. as said the electoral college consists of 538 electors. each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. The electorals are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but varys by the state laws on what their responsibility are. Presidental election are held every 4 years on the tuesday after the first monday in november. we help choose our state electors when we vote for our president. most states have a ""winner takes all"" system that awards all electors the the winnig candidate. After the election, our state governor prepares a "" Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your sate with the electors too. so when we vote for our candidiate, then we are really votiong their electors. It should be that we just vote for our candidate and that be just that. the electors do the vote for their candidate, with our votes that we put for our candidate.

Richard Nixion, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all the one the that they agree on. And its that answer i had in the begining. To be against the electoral college. They want to abolish the electoral college. But they are not alone. In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of  the electoral college-won the popular vote, but lost the presidency. over 60 percent would perfer the direct election. Whats with the electoral college you may ask? Voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. I want to know who picks the electors in the first place? It really depends on the state who decides. One other thing about the electoral college is that they are unfair to voters. During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all. and voters in 25 of the largest media market didn't get to see not even a single campaign ad. So it is official. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.

The electoral college is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non democratic method of selecting a president that is to be by declaring the candidiate who was givien the most popular votes the winner. There is said ti be five reasons for retaining the electoral college. 1. Certainty of Cutcome, 2. Everyone's President, 3. Swing States, 4. Big States, 5. Avoid Run-Off Elections. its an arguement that the electoral college method of selecting the president may be turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. Democrats in texas, for example or Republicans in california. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.

So as you can see the reason of what i had put down, the electoral college is one that im not in favor of because it being not fair. and the fact that we are voting for the elector, not the candidates who are running for president. wish that you can see it from my point of view. Thank you for your time from: PROPER_NAME",1,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Imagine walking around with your skull showing. There would be no protection to cover it. The face is what covers it so nobody would see inside your head. The face is just a natural landform.

There is support that the face is a natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking pictures of the landing sites that could be their sister ship Viking 2, when they came up on a shadowy likeness of a human face. A couple days later NASA showed the picture for everyone to see. That's the support that the face is a natural landform.

There is evidence from the article that support my claims. ""And so on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time Michael Malin and his MOC took some pictures ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the picture first appeared on JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There were no alien monument at all."" That is edvidence from the article that support my claims.

Others say the face was created by aliens. Photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the red planet in September 1997 eighteen years after the Viking missions ended. However, a picture of the natural landform appeared on the JPL website. Some still didn't believe the face is a natural landform.

"Should we keep the Electorial College the way it is or change it to election by popular vote? Statistcs show that over 60 percent of voters vould prefer a direct election, rather than the kind we have now. Even with that being said, the electorial college still has its ''defenders''.

The Electorial college is made up of 538 electors, a majority of the 270 electorial votes is required to be elected to be President. Each state is allowes allotment of electors. One for each member in the house of representatives, with two each for Senators. Each canidata running for President is allowed their own group of electors, which are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. With that being said, state laws vary on how the electors are picked and what each of their responsibilitys are. Each Presidential election is held every four years, on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

What is so wrong with the electorial college that 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct election? Well, under the electorial college system voters do not vote for the president, but vote instead for a slate of electors. Say you wanted to vote for a president who is Demographic, you would then vote for a slate of 34 demographic electors that pledged to that president. The electors are not allowed to be someone who is holding public office. With this being said, the voters cannot always control who their electors vote for.

In the ELectorial Colleges' deffence, its avoids the problem of elections where neither of the candidate's recieve a majority of the vote. It is very possible that the winner of the electorial vote may not wint the national popular vote, even though it happens very rarely it happened in 2000. Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still fewer electorial votes, that was the first time since 1888. n

The thought of having to vote for the President of the United States, you actually get to pick who you want it to be. That would mean not only changing the constitution and having to come up with more rules and responsibilities, but allowing one to vote directly for who they want to become President. Wouldn't that be easier? Instead of having to come up with a electorial college and dealing with all of the risks, allowing citizens to pick for themselfs. I agree with the though of abolishing the electorial college, and so do 60 perecnt of voters. When a citizen votes on the electorial college itself, they have the chance of the college not pivking the President they would like to vote for.

With all of that being said, and the facts given right to you, it up to you to decide what you think is better for the United States. Either way, we still have to vote on a President every four years... with or without a Electorial College.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0

"Empty streets,with eerily devoid traffic jams is an example of what happens when a city bans car usage. Cleaner air, and less stress are two of the many reasons why the idea of limiting car usage is becoming popular. Many cities are taking place in what they call a "" Car-Free Day"" in which they participate in a day without cars. Taxis and buses are permitted only, with the goal to promote alternitive transportation. Bikers covered the streets and hikers flooded the sidewalks as a result of car-free day. Violators were faced with fines of $ 25.

A day without cars is considered part of an improvement to many cities. Cars cause major damage to the world around us, smog is one of the many reasons places like Paris are reducing their car usage as well. Car usage reduction has beneficial implications for the enviorment we live in. Paris is a testimony to that statement. With smog polluting the global city, Paris was forced to create a partial driving ban to clear the air. WIth France favoring diesel fuel over gasoline, Paris had more smog than other European capitals. Therefore, Paris decided to make motorists with even-numbered license plates leave their cars at home. Same with the odd-numbered license plates the following day. Reuters claim that up to 4,000 drivers were fined, and 27 car owners had their vehicle impounded due to their reactions to the fines. After the ban was implemented, the smog had cleared enough for the French ruling party to remove the ban off of odd-numbered plates the next day.

Car reduced communities are finding that being less dependant on cars is helping by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Less pollution is a major goal being achieved by this concept of reduced car usage. "" It's a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Carlos Arturo Plaza commented as he rode his two-seat bicycle with his wife.

Fellow citizens it is our responsibility to stop pollution, take a stand by reducing your car usage. Ride your bike to school or work instead of driving. Walk to places near by and give your car a break. Consume less gas, stop choking your city. Make an impact today, put your car away. Global pollution is adding to the problems of our global warming today.",2,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"Feelings, we all have them, whether you are happy,sad, or angry, friends or family members can mostly tell when you are in a certain mood,but what if a computer could do the same exact thing.

Author Nick D'Alto wrote an article called,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" which is about computers that can read emotions, thats crazy! Nick talks about how computers can spit out precents of feelings like in paragraph one he sated,""She’s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Thats a computer scaning the Mona Lisa picture created by Leonardo da Vinci. NIck stated,""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" So, these computers use musclkes in your face to figure out the emotions you are felling. So, how is this helpful to students in a classroom? Well, Nick gives an example by stating from Dr.Huang from Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,” Dr. Huang predicts. “Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.” Not only would it see if a student is bored or confused but the computer would help make the lesson more interseting to the student.

The big downfall of all of this would be prices, such as video games because, the computer would help better tell a story line and have the player thinking how the character feel ( let them feel more in the game). The article stated,""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive—for video games or video surgery."" But, other than that these computer can be very valuable to humans in the future and example more about humans emothions towards school, eachother, etc. Not the mention teenage boys can be excited and if they are in the middle of class on youtube or something, how would that be stopped so the student doesnt get embrassed.

Wrapping all of this up, computer are used on a daily schulde whether its at home or school, computer could help slove depression by putting students into a great mood, help humans on tests or problems in life.

"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom are valuable. It's valuable because it can detect when the students are bored, or confused with the subject they are learning or the lesson the teacher is teaching, If the Facial Action Coding System is used in classrooms it could possible help more students because the system could notify the teacher on who might be having trouble or major difficulties.

I claim that the value of using the technology to read students' emotional expressions would be good. Evidence to back my statement up is "" Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" More evidence to back my statement up is ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Which I believe that woudl be a wonderful source for not only students that are confused about something they are learning, but for the teachers too because it would help them know when a student is struggling, or is not really interested as much as they should be.

"By being the second planet from the sun, venus has gained al ot of attention from scientists and try a lot of way to make our way to the Venus, but none of the scientist have ever get lay their hands on the Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of the light in night sky, and a very challenging place to examine more closely.

Venus is referred as Earth twin, because its the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest distance too. Sometimes Venus is only i the right corner in space terms, so scientist has sent numerous spacecraft to landin Venus but each previous mission is unmanned, and no spacecarft survived the landing for more than few hours.

Venus has thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and surface of venus, the temperature average is 800 degrees Fahrenheit and 90 times greater atmospheric pressure than what we experience in Erath's. Even though like that, the scientists is fascinated by venus because it may well once have been Earth-like planet in our solar system.

By hovering safely far abopve the planet or peering at Venus from a ship orbiing

far above the planet can provide only limited information. Researches cannot take any forms of rocks, gas or anything from the distance. Therefor, to understand the Venus, they would need to get upclose. NASA is working on other way to approaching the Venus and some electroniocs have been tested and only lasted a couple of week in such conditions.

If you have a driverless car they are going to be focused on one thing, and thats getting you to where you hvae to go. That is not the only thing a good driver should be focused on. When you drive, not only do you have to focus on where you're going, you should focus on the other cars around you because you don't know what kind of drivers are out there. The fancy cars may drive by there self and have cameras but will that stop them from getting into an accident? A car can swerve over so quick and the cameras may not even notice.

Whenever they allow driverless cars in most states, its going to create aot of work for the goverment. You have to create new laws, and you would have to qualify for those laws. The best way to keep it is like we have now. We now have cars that may stop and park on their own, and personally that seems to be enough for me. Why would someone want to spend money on a robot car that just drives on its own? The only things thats doing is just making people wanna text while their car is being operated by something they don't even understand. The first reason people will most likely be in danger is the fact that they are going to feel like they don't have to do anything but just sit there. Whenever you have to just watch the rode it can get boring and you might wanna watch a movie on your phone but if you look down you might get a warning to take contol and something happens before you can even look up. Then whose fault will that be? Thats only going to get the car companies sued because the people who bought the cars are gonna be injured and want to blame the car company for warning them too late.

Cars that require drivers are better, they offer more and if you drive somewhere you can go the way you want to unlike the driverless cars, they might take you a longer way than what you want. If you drive by your self YOU can take any short cut that you want. GM has created cars that have seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger. Some people may get scared easily and a vibrating seat when the car is silent and their mind is on something else can create a panic attack, then what happens? The car and the driver can be at risk all because the seat scared them. I think that if you want to have a driverless car you should just call a taxi so you can sit in the back and have someone else drive for you. If they create driverless taxis that will cause alot of people to lose their job and that will make the crimerate to go up because they might find another job and it's gonna make them angry and wanna take their frustration out on other people.

When someone buys a driverless car they might have to take a class on that to teach them how to work with the cars operating system and thats doing too much. The point that i am gettin at is that if you need a liscense to drive and they come out with these driverless cars that a waste of your learning skills and people shouldn't even have to go through that if they are going to make you get a driverless car thats so pointless because you should have to have rquirements to operate one, and if they don't have any then i am going to stick with my arguement because self driving is more traditional and that's the way it should be.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Is Venus worth studying? Venus being Earth's alike twin is one of the most hottest plant on our solar system, yet not one you can visit for more than a few hours. Scientist have thought about sending machines to study and deeply reasearch more about the planet Venus, but Venus being too hot they overthink it about the temperature and how hot it is. Venus is a very hot planet that can melt anything that's metal and a human-being could not even survive on this planet.

Venus is known as Earth's ""twin"". People believe that venus was once just like earth, that it was covered with oceans before it got extremely hot and became like hell because of it's temperature. the the article, In paragraph 4, ""Surface of rocky sediment, familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" There was or still are some land features on Venus, but as we continued to read the article it told us that if there were any land seeking on it's planet that it would be stroke by lightning. ""Temperatures average over 800 degrees fahreneit, atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet."" Venus being one of the most hottest planet on the soaler system and presenting impediments such as volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightening strikes. Overall, Venus is known as earth's alike ""Twin"". It is one of the hottest planets on the solar system, no human being could survie on it by it's high temperatures. Land can't be seeking or else it gets destroyed by lightning. Scientist do believe that it was once like earth, and had oceans.

Venus being too hot and such a risky planet to explore. Researchers have been overthinking and trying to invent technology that's able to resist Venus's temperature. ""Researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" NASA has thought about sending people to explore Venus on a jet airplane, that's able to stay high above ground suface. Reasearchers do know that if they risk and send people out to explore, it is going to be callenging to get samples of rocks, gas, or anything else from a distance.""Electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface, having lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Venus with such high temperatures and metal not lasting long that can melt very quickly, they've been testing, trying to get machines made out of different material so it can last on Venus. In other words, Venus is too hot and exposing a phone, tablet, or any electronic to acid or heat can be melted tin and no machine is resistant to such an exaggerated heat. NASA have thought and been wanting to send people to explore Venus but the thought of it being too risky, dangerous is what they wonder.

In conclusion, Is Venus worth studying? No, It is a very hot planet, that's risky, challenging, and dangerous for humans to explore. Not even a machine can last on land. Reasearchers have tried and invented machines to try and get somewhere, it's hard for them to even get a smaple from a distance. Venus is a very hot planet that can melt anything and huam-beings couldn't even survive on this planet.",3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars sound like an exciting concept. In paragraph two it even says how people have been fasinating with cars that could driver themselves for ages now. But, in my opinion I believe driverless cars wouldn't be a good idea.

The passage gives many reasons why driverless cars would be good and why they'd also be bad. In my opinion they'd just cause more trouble than regular cars already do. In the passage it says how they have a lot of sensors, and gadgets to make them ""safe,"" but what happens when one or a two of those sensors go out? And then the owner of the car doesn't have the money to go out and buy a new one. They're going to be driving a car that not only is putting themselves in danger, but also the people around them.

Another reason why I believe that driverless cars wouldn't be a good idea is because of what was stated in paragraph 9. What's going to happen when the car gets in an accident and causes damage to another driverless car? We already have laws that go along with regular cars, and to whom is at fault when an accident happens. These cars are going to cause so much more drama than there already is! There are going to be accidents, there is no way we can avoid it. There are going to be malfuntions in the driverless car. There are still malfunctions in the cars we drive today and you see how long we've been dribing them around! Driverless cars are only going to cause more problems that we don't need.

Let's say driverless cars become a reality, and they're everywhere. What's going to happen to the cars we drive today? I absolutly love cars, and the reason I love cars is because as a teenager that just got her license not too long ago; this is what I've been looking forward to since age seven! If manually driven cars get taken away from us how are we going to know who's worthy of driving on the street? Driverless cars are going to be everywhere. They're going to be the cars teens take their drivers test in. How exactly are people going to be able to determine whether or not they're going to be safe on the roads if a car is doing all of the work for them? I just don't see how people expect this all to work out, but then again this is probably what people were thinking when they were transitioning over from hourse and buggies to automobiles.

I believe driverless cars are a bad idea. There are dozens of details in this article to back me up on this. I've always believed why change something that's already good? It's like your mom making your favorite apple pie. It's the best apple pie you've ever had in your life. And one day your mom decides she wants to change it up a bit, and that change just completly ruins it for you. It'll never be the same again because of that one time that she decided to change it up. And that's how I see driverless cars. I see them as something that'll just ruin it for everyone. Manually driving a car gives you such a rush, it's the first thing in your life that makes you feel independent. It makes in feel like you're finally in control of your life for the first time. I feel as though it would be a shame to take that away from the people who haven't experienced it for themselves.",3,4,1,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Today we will be talking about the story ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" So sit back in your chair, and prepare to get lost your mind. Veiwer beware you might just learn somthing new.

In this paragraph will be talking about the young man on his way to eroup Luke Bomberger. Some people say that it was dangerous but I say he did a heroic act by bring cattle and horses to war torn countries. Now we think why he did that for so long, it wasent money, fame, or even for himself. No he did that selfless act for those people who had nothing left after war war 2. If you ask thats why he did it to help those women, men, and children, of china germany italy and all sorts of places that were left in ruins.

In this paragraph will be talking about Luke's claims. Such as he knew it was an opprotunity of a life time. That is supported by parts of the story were he may have to work but has fun in between his hard work. Like when in italy he visits such places like Crete or the Acropolis. There were also bad times like when he fell of that slipery ladder and broke some of his ribs in a storm and almost fell over board if it wasent for a small metal bar holding him in.

For a second lets talk about the time he spent overseas. We look at the fun he had in his nine adventures. Such as when he first visted Greece. He went to the Acropolis, soon after he visited the Panama Canal. Those were just some of the places that he got to travel not includeing Venice or Crete or even China.

In the end all you can say about Luke Bombriger is that he tried to help people. He was so selfless that even broken ribs couldnt stop him form doing whats right. There are only words that can discribe his charachter, selfless, kind harted. The number one thing you can call him this and simply this human.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The author thinks we are still going to explore the planet Venus in the future, Venus once had some simlulary parts with earth. Scientists still would like to explore the planet and test some of the rocks there. Even though the Planet Venus is Earth like, but Venus is hoter then Earth, so we still can't visit the planet.

Scientist believe that the panet Venus long ago did have living form on it. They also believe that is possible for humans to go for a planetary visits and possibly survive. One of the danger on Planet Venus's is the\ high temperatures, high carbondixide level, and the Atamsphere there still needs more testing to be sure.

Scientist say Venus is survivalbe, but they needs more test and experiment before sending humans for plantary visits or sending humans to live there. Venus once had some simuler parts with Earth such as mountains,volcanos, and oceans.

"The author of this article thinks that we as humans should explore Venus despite the dangers it presents. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun it's also the hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is also considered Earth's twin, it is the closest planet to the Earth terms of density and size.

The author starts his claim on how Venus is somewhat similair to Earth. He also says that long ago Venus was just like earth it had different forms of life and landscapes. It still holds some of the more rocky landscape. The author says how the condition on Venus is bad, but still liveable for humans and NASA should send humans to go and study Venus.

The idea of studying Venus sound really mindblowing, but with all of the grotesque conditions it's going to make it dificult to imposible for humans to go there. First of all, Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. The clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The tempetures in venus are even worse it can get up to 800 degrees Farenheit, 90 times greater than what we experence on Earth. With that type of environment it's going to make it extremely difficult to go and study Venus.

Even with all of the difficult challenges Venus has, the author is very optimistic of how we as humans should explore Venus despite the dangers it presents.",2,2,3,2,0,1,1,1,0
"To me personally I think that driverless cars should be developed because they would change the world. By developing these driverless cars it would not only change the world but save, gas,money and time. So to me the development of these cars should definitely take place.

The first reason I think driverless cars should be developed is because they cause less accidents. These cars cause less accidents because they are sensored causing the car causing the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine. These cars allow better resonse and control than human driver manage alone just from sensors and makes driving safer for people. The driverless cars also has vibrating seat belts when the vehicle is in danger of backing into a object. So this is the first reason why I think driverless cars should be developed.

The second reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because they have far more flexibility than a bus. By developing driverless cars people dont have to worry about being late for work because the bus is too slow or is making too many stops. By having a driverless car people would be able to get to work,school,or anyother place they want to on time. People wouldn't have to rely on a bus that has to keep making stops when they can get where they need to be on time with this car. This is the second reason why i think driverless cars should be developed because they are more flexible than a bus.

The third and final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed is because it saves people gas money. This car would save people gas money because it uses sensors to function like to stop brakes, accelerate and steer. By this car saving people gas money they can use the money to buy things instead of spending alot on gas. So this is the final reason why I think driverless cars should be developed because they save people gas money.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"In my opinion I think it will be a good idea for the teachers to know if a student is in a good mood or not. When a teacher calls on a student and dont not want to go the teacher might think it is because that child is being rude, and all that the child want is to be left alone.

With the scaning programs, that could scan your face and can tell if you are in a good mood or not, teachers and student could have a good bond. If the teacher scans a kid face in morning when they all enter class she could know who to call on ,or maybe even after class she could even have a talk with the child. If someone can tell how a person feel if it's fear , anger ,digust, happiness,and surprise.

Those are some examples of ways it will be useful to have the ""Facial Action Coding System"". That type of technolgy would be very valuable in the classroom,and maybe even outside of school.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The author of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus."" Did a bad job of supporting his claims that we should study venus despites the danger that presents. His information was plentyful it gaves us a good idea on what he believes and whats happening to further their opinion. Unfourtanely it didn't provide us with enough good follow up supports.

First off with his first and second reasons being astronmers are fascinated by Venus due to the possiblity of it being it earth like previously and thats its still has some earth like features. This is stated in paragraph four as it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" and ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Despite these good points he doesn't further it more in paragraph four he only states that it can be our nearest option for a plantary which adds nothing to the claim and isn't a good follow up of what they said previously.

His third reason is in paragraph 8 the last paragraph and it is""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. this is a really good claim but the author only follows it up wih human curiosty will just lead us into equally intimidating endaevors which adds pretty much nothing in regards to his claim. Paragrph 8 is the final paragraph and its a horrible placement to put your final reasoning.

Overall the author reasons are good but it lacks any follow up support to back it up. While giving information for context is great the author over did it and it took up the majority of the paragraphs leaving no room to put some of their reasons in more early paragraphs to catch the readers attention. Many follow up to their reasons added nothing to the authors claim making it usless information. It wouldn't have been so bad if the author hade made it less an info dump and more reasoning to help their claim.",3,3,2,1,0,0,0,2,0
"Is it good to be curious or not? The author evaluates that Venus is a worthy pursuit and dangerous. NASA wants to send humans to study Venus so they can benefit from it. Venus have many dangerous elements that can kill a human while entering the atmosphere. NASA creates machines to be able to withstand Venus to study it closer.

The author evaluates that Venus is worthy pursuit. In paragraph 8 it says ""Striving to meet the challenge present by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" NASA wants to study Venus so they can learn more about the materials there that can help build the future and scientific data. The author evaluates that Venus is worthy pursuit because it can help gain insight on the planet itself and human curiosity. Despite being worthy pursuit Venus is also dangerous.

The author evaluates that Venus is dangerous. In paragraph 3 it says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Going in Venus's atmosphere is enough to kill a human so NASA is working on other approaches to get close and study Venus. NASA is getting ready to get closer to the dangers of Venus and uncover its mysteries.

The author evaluates that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and dangerous. The author shows that studying Venus has value and gain insight to the planet itself. The author also shows what obstacled humanity needs to break through to be able to explore Venus more. Curiosity lead to many peoples death but it also leads to the advancement of humanity.

"Although it would be nice to have a driverless cars, the possibilities of getting into an accident are tremendous. I wouldn't want to have to rely on my car to drive me anywhere at anytime. Just the thought of not having the control of the wheel scares me. Having to trust your car to do the things you want it to do is stomach wrenching. I think it is just as bad as texting and driving.

Manufactures created this thing to signal and alert when the drivers must take control. What if the driver fell asleep? What if he/she were to busy that they didn't feel the vibrating of the chair or couldn't see the flashing lights on the windshield? You might think it isn't a problem but if you think about it, it is. Driverless cars would probably make people start depending on their cars a lot more. This could cause drivers to become lazy and not worry about what might happen. When someone lazy depends on something, they don't really think twice about it. This would make them not care about driving.

Another thing to think about is how the driverless car would react to a sudden accident. What if a car came crashing into the driverless car that it didn't have time to react. It would mean that the driver wasn't paying attention to the road and not fast enough reflex to take over the wheel. In paragraph 7 it states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" A driverless car shouldn't be trusted completly for one of this reason. In paraghraph 7 it states another, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Again, what if the driver was to busy not paying attention or was ditracted? What if the were to slow to react just in time?

If texting and driving is illegal, why should a driverless car have a shot? It is basically the same thing. You won't have your hands on the steering wheel. You won't be paying attention to your surroundings. You would have your eyes somewhere other than the roads. A driverless car would make someone put all their trust into it and hope for the best.

I would rather have the complete control of the wheel rather than letting technology take over it. Technologies don't always work out well. I wouldn't want to rely on something that can take my life or someone else life for that matter. ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-- the driver ot the manufacturer?"" I take driving realy seriously and to think that I wouldn't even be driving a car while I'm in one is already stressing enough.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College is ruining everything that our fore fathers have worked for! When Americans vote, the majority believe that they are voting for the President of their choice, instead they are voting for a group of people, who will hopefully vote for the candidate they had wanted. The Electoral College is wrong for many reasons, but I'll narrow it down to two for you; People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote.

First, The Electoral College is wrong because voters are voting for electors not the President. When voting there are two groups of people voting for the President; the People and members of the Electoral College. Members of the Electoral College are actually choosen by state legislatures, meaning that their can be a point in time where the statre legislature chooses to pick a certain group of people based off of their political party. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the electors from the Democratic party; meaning that even if most people voted for Kennedy (the president at the time) he would still not be elected because electors would not vote for someone who was not apart of their party. It's happen before, so who's to say that it won't happen again.

Second, electors may or may not choose the President based off Popular vote. Even though if we did base the presidental election off of Poplular vote people might vote based off of region, meaning that most people in the south would vote for someone like Romney, but we have to consider that not everyone in the south would vote for one person. Also it is also true that it electors rarely vote against the Popular vote, but it is possible that the majority of the 538 electors will vote against the people.

In conclusion, The Electoral College should be terminated because People are voting for electors, not the president and electors might not choose the President based off Popular vote. In 1960 the state legislature almost replaced the Electoral group, meaning that the Popular vote would'nt even matter against the Electoral College. Also the Electoral College may acknowledge the Popular vote, but still vote for a different candidate. If you do choose to help me terminate the Electoral College, I say we try to get help from the guy who actually played the ""Terminator"" I heard that he is part of the government system in California now so he could probably help us.",3,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Is the Facial Action Coding System Useful in Classrooms?

What if there was a machine capable of not only reconizing, but also understanding feelings via facial expressions? There actually is a machine that could do that. It is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. This technology could be very useful in classrooms, it could reconize the emotions of the students, it could help identify or even prevent certain situations before they even happen by identifying a problem, and it could help give teachers much needed feedback on the class that they wouldn't verbally recieve.

FACS constructs a 3-D model of the face. It takes into account all 44 maajor facial muscles to determine the feelings or emotions of a person. For example, if you raise your forntalis pars lateralis, or the mucles above your eyes, you are displaying surprise. Using this technology in classrooms could help learn the emotions of students and show how they are feeling.

Identifying emotions in the classroom could be very useful. Students on average sit in classrooms for 6-8 hours a day. Their emotions are still developing and they themselves are still maturing. Sometimes, students may have breakdown or outburst because of various reasons. A student might be stressed out about their grades and begin to preform poorly. Usinng FACS this behavior could be predicted and prevented, letting the teacher know that that student needs a little extra encouragement or more academic assitment. Also, the school enviroment has many variables aside from classrooms alone and that could also cause problems. A student who becomes angry at their classmates has the possibilty of putting them in trouble, It coould either lead to a fight, confrontation, bullying, an other things. Yet, if the problem could be determined becore it could even start, it could help defuse or prevent the situation from escalating resulting in a safer learning enviroment. Considering this FACS could become a very useful additions to the schools as a community.

FACS could not only help the school as a whole, but more specifically, it could help the teachers. Dr. Huang claimes that, "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" Using this statement we can recognize that not all information and feedback is being recieved by neither student nor teacher. A teacher's job is to help educate and prepare their students for the future. However, that becomes difficult when a single teacher has to take responsibilty of a large ammount of students. Some students express their concerns and questions but others choose to remain silent. Using FACS a teacher could now determine which students are confused and worried and which students are doing fine. By using this information a teacher could offer additional help for a student that a student wouldn't normally ask for. Knowing where to focus on and which students need help could help a teacher tremendously. It would facilitate a teacher's job and help them teach with greater efficientcy.

Facs would recognize student's emotions, help identify and prevent certain situations before they occur, and it would give teachers feedback on the class that they wouldn't recieve otherwise. FACS would help education by targeting students that are well of and students that need additional help instead of having a teacher assume the whole class is confused or content. FACS is an innovative piece of technoly that could bring forth a new age of education if placed in schools.",4,3,2,3,1,2,1,2,1
"This would seem like a good idea having known when a student is struggling or confused and then being able to change the lesson to a more understanding lesson. I don't like the idea of this because I don't think that this would give students their privacy. It freaks me out if I think that someone is watching me through the camera of my smartphone or my laptop. If I knew someone was using my camera on my smartphone to watch me I wouldn't use my smartphone as much just because I wouldn't feel safe. Facial reconition is very interesting and facinating, but it is just not normal and it's scary. This technology is being used in new smartphones where the phone can use facial reconition to unlock your phone and yes, it's cool but it is also a little odd and it's never been done before. This technology could be good for goverment help too, but I don't think this software should be put in student laptops just for if the student gets confused or lost and it can switch the lesson.

The administrators could like this idea but if the student is stuggling with something then they could ask their teacher, if they aren't near their teacher than most teachers would reply to email and help a student through email. Me personally as a student I don't like the idea of this software being put in student laptops. I think the idea of the software being put into smartphones is a bad idea, juust because of people privacy and identity being secure. If someone got a hold of this software and they used it for bad reasons such as identity theft that is a reason I don't like the idea of this software being put into smartphones and laptops. I do however like the idea of this software being able to read emotion especially non human emotion, I think it's very facinating that this software could tell the emotion of the world famous Mona Lisa. Being able to replicate human muscles and and facial structures in a computer to be able and get this kind of technology is absolutely amazing. Emotion is sometimes very complicated to understand when you see someone's facial expression. There are nearly eight billion people on earth and being able to use technology to figure out someone emotional state is nearly ground breaking. This break in technology is outstandind and extremely impresive because there aren't many people who could make a piece of sowtware that can do something like this. I doubt that when Da Vinci painted this world renoun panting that in the future someone would be looking for what emotion Da Vinci put in the Mona Lisa. This painting has had very many conspiracies done about it but I dont think anyone in the world who has seen it has ever went ""I wonder what emotion she is feeling right now""?

In the end I like this software being used to find emotion in humans and paiinting but I don't like the idea of it being used for phones or laptops.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,3,1
"Dear state senator, I believe that you should keep the Electoral College rather than the most popular vote for the president. ""The founding fathers established it"". Basically this method has been going on since George Washington. How it works is you choose either your Republican or Democratic president, and depending on who has more votes for the president. The electoral votes go to the republican or to the democratic.

Citizens of the United States also voted upon this selection. In the passage "" The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it talks about how the candidates don't make it to every state. How could they? They are trying to promote and sign papers. They have a life too you know. They can't be in every single state in America. You could also see them on the Televeision if you want.

The Electoral College doesnt have the problem of elections in which ""no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" Evene if more people voted for the democratic or Republican president they still aren't gonna get what they want. Some people in 2008 wanted that other president, not Obama, to win. In school they were saying how he was racist and that they shouldn't vote for him. He wanted to put all the Mexicans back in Mexico.

Also would you rather count up a million people up or simple the number of senators for each person running which added together would be 538 electors.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Crash. That was the noise of a driverless car having a collision because its sensors did not work. With scientist creating driverless cars they are opening a new set of problems for the daily driver. There is a possiblity that it

will be hard for people to figure out who is at fault, or a driverless car could take lives do to computer problems.

When a driver less car is in a crash, who is the damage pinned on? The car or the driver? This is an issue the daily driver will have to deal with if they start putting driverless cars on the road. When we start letting driverless cars on the road it is a matter of time till one of the cars gets into a crash.

What if a driverless car kills or hits a pedestrian? The counter argument maybe that the car will not hit someone because they have sensors and cameras to not hit someone. There is a possiblity that our technology can go out or stop working and hit someone. That could cause a chain reaction of states not wanting the driverless cars in there state like California did. There is going to be flaws and glitches that need to be worked out before we can put these cars on the road.

With techonolgy advancing, scientist creating are new inventions and modernizing the old ones. Some new invertions are great, but some of them their not such great ideas. With the driverless car there is too many errors that could happen for them to be safe on the road. The cars would cause a lot of problems like it could be hard for people to figure out who is at fault, or a driverless car could take lives do to computer problems or glitches in the system. The world is not ready for driverless cars.",2,3,0,3,1,1,1,1,1
"How can a facial action coding system can identify a persons initial facial exspretion? Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases. If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. And that tecnology can help when others are in a certain state of depresion and that certain somebody doesent want to be noticed that machine can help with a person they may commit suicide. When no one knows it but the machiene can tell if there just trying to put on a good face over a really bad time. So then how can it be useful it will also sovle some unusal cases like some artisis make and no one will ever understand what they were trying to go for inside the person. Like the Mona Lisa some people will probably never understand what if just is smiling or grining for the picture. If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places. If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not.

"The electoral college is a very controversial topic.  It has been debated by important figures like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole (Plumer).  While some people agree with Bradford Plumer and say that we should abolish this method, others stand behind Richard A. Posner, wanting to keep the electoral college.  Although the electoral college restores some of the weight in larger states, it is a very unfair method for voting on our president.  The electoral college allows someone to win the presidency who did not win the popular vote, and, if a tie occurs, the outcome is demeaning to larger states.

The electoral college does have a favorable trait.  It restores some of the weight in the political balance that larger states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution (Posner). The senate only appoints 2 representatives per state, no matter how large their populations are.  The electoral college gets rid of this problem, assigning representitives to states based on population.

While that aspect of the electoral college is beneficial, it may be the only thing.  The electoral college is an extremely unfair method.  Just take the 2000 election, for instance.  Al gore won the popular vote but, thanks to this flawed method of selecting our president, lost the presidency (Plumer).  This was uncalled for.  If someone wins the popular vote and is wanted as president by the majority of people, then they should be president.  Our president is a position of the utmost importance.  We should have a leader that the majority of the people want.

Not only is the actual process unfair, but if there ever happens to be a tie it's even worse.  In the event of a tie in the electoral vote, the election is passed on to the House of Representatives, who then have the state delegations vote on the president (Plumer).  However, the catch is that each state gets only one vote (Plumer).  This means that the single represenative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters (Plumer).  This process is extremely unequal and should not be allowed.  Everyone should be able to have equal representation and play a part in critical decisions like this one.

All in all, the electoral college is unfair and people despise it.  According to a poll in 2000, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now (Plumer).  The electoral college, while it may restore some of the weight in larger states, is detested all across the United States.  The person with the popular vote doesn't always win, and, in the event of a tie, the process is even more unfair than the actual method itself. The electoral college is an awful process that the majority of people don't want.  So why is it still here?",4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4
"Hello, (Insert State Senators name),

My name is PROPER_NAME.

A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?

Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this. Our Forefathers created the Electoral College because they believed it to be the best method in securing a true democratic result for the leader of the USA. People say that the Electoral College is outdated because the times have moved on... well then, if that's true, I suppose we should just drop America's image of Freedom because it was made by some stupid old guys. Ummm... No. It is LOGICAL that true DEMOCRACY would be the greater portion of the PEOPLE that VOTE for the PRESIDENT. The opposite side of this argument says that it is unfair some of the states are skipped over because defeat is guarenteed. Defeat is guarenteed... don't people understand what that means? Here, let me explain it to you guys reeeeeeeeeeeeall simple so you can understand it: 1+1=2. ther ya go. job well done.",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Dear State Senator,

We should be able to keep the Electoral College because it hasn't caused any harm when it comes to electing president or vice president. As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College is a provess, not a place."" It's a compromise between the election of the president voted by congress and the citizens.""

The Electoral College is where meetings are held to establish who our Presidents and Vice presidents are. As stated in the article, ""The Electoral College has 538 electors and a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""

Each candidate that want to be President that's running in one's state has their own group electors, as stated in the article. ""The electors are generally picked by the candidates political party, state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.""

WE should be able to keep the loft because it has a definite outcome when our president is elected. According to the article, they're five good reasons why we should keep the Electoral College. ""1) certainty of outcome, 2)eveyone's President, 3)Swing states, 4)Big states, 5) avoid Run-Off Elections.

In conclusion, I believe that we should keep the Electoral College because of the positive affects i think it has when electing Presidents.",1,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Technology can be beneficial in several aspects of everyday life, but reading emotions should not be one of them. According to the article, the technology to read human emotions is possible and can be effiecently used to detect how a person is feeling. This technology is certainly impressive but does not seem very beneficial to the average student and can be seen as slightly intrusive. Therefore, this technology would not be valuable in a classroom due to the small amount of benefit that it would provide and its intrusiveness, as students should have a right to keep certain emotions and feelings to themselves.

It seems unnecessary to use this technology when emotions are already fairly easy to identify without the use of a computer. Body language and facial expressions can already easily be analyzed by humans themselves to reveal emotions. To quote the writer of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" (D'Alto 5). This depicts that technology is not required to identify the basic emotions of a human being and is therefore unnecessary.

If a person is not blatantly showing his emotions with body language and facial expressions, then the person wold likely prefer not to express what he is feeling or thinking. All human beings have a natural right to keep their thoughts and emotions to themselves as they please, and technology that can reveal emotions at their deepest depths can be intrusive. An example of this can be how computers use cookies to track what people are searching on the Internet in order to produce advertisements directed toward the user later on, which often disturbs people and makes them feel uncomfortable. This may be the same situation if computers have access to human emotions. The private feelings of a human should not be exploited by a computer, and therefore trespasses a basic right of humans which allows them to have their own private thoughts and emotions.

The final reason that this technology would not be valuable is because there are little uses for it. Detecting emotions are not really relevant when using a computer. The author of the article states many examples of how this technology can be used on a computer, and the use of using the emotions to determine the type of advertisements would match emotions and what the user is feeling does not seem very important or beneficial. Overall, the implementation of technology into a student's everyday life would not be useful, therefore making it seem pointless rather than valuable.

Therefore, the idea of implementing technology that read emotions would not be valuable in a typical classroom. Despite the consistency of the technology working successful, it would be worthless to bring into everyday lives as people do not need advanced computers to identify other people's emotions. The technology would also be extremely intrusive, as it would exploit the private thoughts and emotions of people that would not want their emotions to be detected and make them feel slightly uncomfortable. Alongside these reasons, there is practically no use for this advanced technology in a typical day of an ordinary student. For these reasons, while the concept of reading emotions may be interesting, there is not much benefit that will come from the use of this technology and therefore implementing it into classrooms would be a prodigious waste of money and effort in order to provide a minimal benefit for students.",4,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,3

"Dear,

Rick Scott

We dont need another voting crisis over the small states, the representitives voting how they want to vote to suit their needs. Our voting system needs to be perfected, so we dont have any more tie elections of complications. The Electoral College system is very easy to get unballenced and played arround with to get the outcome that they so desire. As a country we should abolish the Electoral College system and vote baised of off popular vote.

When the whole country votes for the president, in reality we are really voting for a groop of electors to do this job for us. In artical 2"" Under the electoral college system,voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is saying that the people really dont directly vote for the president and in that time anything can happen to the voting data. Another clame to help that piont is artical 2 ""conciter that state legislaturs are technically responcible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The excerpt from article 2 is saying again that anything can happen to the data and it can be easily tampered with. In article 3 "" its the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential canidate you are acually voting for a stats of electors."" Again this still says that we are not dirrectly voting and the people want that.

The ""winner takes all"" voting method is not really effective because if a little less than half of claforna votes democrat and a little more than half vote republican, should all 55 votes go to the republican canidate or should that percent go to the canidate? In article 1 ""Most states have a ""winner-take all"" system that awards all electors to the wining presidential canidate."" This system is qutie unjustice and not equal to the rest of the states expesilly for the ""swing"" states.

This system of electorial college is not the most balenced of the systems that our nation can come up with. In article 2 "" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe."" This so called ""amazing"" system has manny defaults and those defaults will cause huge problems tor the rest of the nation. In article 3 "" A tie in the nation wide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes -538- is an even number."" So ties in the national voting for the president can have a tie and is not that efficent in the way that we find who wins.

There are some bright sides to this style of voting. In article 1"" The founding fathers established it in the Constution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election."" A compromise is good for our country and it was created a long time ago - might be older than dirt. Also in article 1"" The electors are generally chosen by the canidates politicle party."" So atleast the people in whom the people are trusting to put their votes in is by someone that the head of the politicle party trusts.

To conclude the electoral colege system needs to be retired and the country needs to vote off of popular voting. The people need to represent them selves and not by some random person who could mess with the voting data to get who they want to win the election. Each state has to give up all of its votes to one side of the 2 parties. When their is a tie on who should be Americas next president, tell me how is the government going to handle a mass catastrophe?",3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

Venus sometimes called the Evening Star tis one of the brightest points of light in the sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. However this nickname is misleading sice Venus is actually a planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only bacause human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidateing endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be llimited by dangers and doubts but should be expaned to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. More importantly researchers cannot take sampples of rock, gas,or anything else from a distance. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Immagine a blimp-like vehiclw hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. At thirty-plus miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea levell on Earth.",0,1,2,1,0,1,2,2,0
"Technology has come a long way from when it first began, not only does it have positive outcomes, it is also very helpful in this new era of technology. For example some individuals find it very hard to express themselves verbally and emotionally in today's world, with a new invention that could help one express oneself, emotions could become much easier to handle. A teacher may find it hard to make their students engage in learning, a computer being able to read the emotional expressions of students is one of the positive outcomes that could not only help the teachers, but the students as well.

If a student was having trouble expressing and explainig thier feelings, they would want some sort of ""way out"", by this I mean that if such a computer was used on an infividual to understand what they feel, expressing emotions would be much easier. Teachers not only have to teach a certain subject, they also have to find a way to make their students get engaged and make a connection with them to help them understand. Dr. Paul Eckman created FACS (Facial Action Coding Sytstem) by associating emotions with the characteristic movements of the facial muscles. If this system was used on students, a teacher would have a better understanding of how students feel during a certain subject or exercise.

Although others may argue that with this sytem being used, one might not feel as safe internally or mentally because their emotions would be constantly tracked on a computer where anyone can see it; they must see the positve outcomes that may follow by using this procedure. For example, many people struggle with understanding algebra equations or literary questions, with the help of this new system scientists could decode all emotions that we did not even know existed.",2,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever thought of how the Facial Action Coding System could be beneficial in your everyday life? In a painting of Mona Lisa this sofware is very helpful at describing emotions. This technology can help computers and humans to communicate better. ""At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The softwarre is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institiute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" This invention can make a difference in our everyday lives.

The Facial Action Coding System can be very effective on teachers in a classroom. Some teachers might have a hard time understanding if the student is grasping onto the content or not. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrector. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive."" This could dramatically help the teachers and students become more successful. It can help identify emotions that a person is feeling, without verbally having to say what is going on.

This is a valuable technology that can greatly impact the world. Identifying specific emotions for what a person is feeling can do a great deal of help. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This invention will help make life a lot easier for a lot of people.",1,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"People often wonder when the world is going to end; will humans need a new place to live? Scientists have been researching alternatives to living on earth, such as living on mars or venus. Both planets would need some modifications before humans would be able to take residence but both planets are possible alternatives for when earth decides to die. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains some of the difficulties scientists have to deal with when trying to explore venus. The author of this article shows his readers that by using maybe older technology mixed with newer thinking the scientists at NASA might be able to penetrate Venus' surface long enough to get the samples they need and in return protect the lives of their astronauts.

Scientists at NASA have been trying to figure out how to penetrate the atmosphere of Venus without losing any lives. They have come up with ideas like sending astronauts about 30 miles above venus to get some samples, the only problem being that getting samples would be next to impossible (pararaph 5). The reason for this being is that the men simply can reach down to the surface becuase the temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the high pressure is enough to crush a submarine into a dime (paragraph 3) Not only that but the weather on the surface is absolutley horrendus, presenting errupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightening strikes (paragraph 3). These lightening strike have proven a problem for probes sent up to the surface of venus becuase they just get shocked and are no longer of use.

Luckily for our dying planet though, NASA is working on creating a simple and sturdy machine to go up and collect samples, the last one they tested lasted up to three weeks in their simulaiton of Venus (paragraph 7). Another way they are modifying these machines is by using older technology becuase it does not require electronics, and without the electronics you get out the risk of lightening destroying the million dollar toy (paragraph 7). A good thing about using mechanical parts versus electronic parts is that mechanical parts are said to be, ""more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" (paragraph 7).

By using mechanical machines NASA can ensure the safety of the astronauts and get the samples they need to discover is Venus is in fact, a habitable plantet. The author shows this by explaining how using austronauts simply is not enough and that by combining older technology and newer thinking that scientists at NASA can penetrate Venus' serface and discover if it is habitable. If NASA combines their thinking with the older, and sturdier technology the advencements they could make would be tremendous. They could discover is Venus is habitable and possibly be able to modify it they way they need to so venus can become habitable. If the process does not work with venus they could use their research on mars or possiby other planets in the solar system.",3,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"There are both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Though I believe why change what's not broke; there are many people out there who believe driverless cars are the future.

The positive aspects of driverless cars are as follows: there are sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes: these sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids, these vehicles have a traffic jam assistance to signal to the driver that it is time to take over to navigate work zones and accidents, they can steer, accelerate, and break themselves.

The negative aspect of the driverless cars are as follows: more laws would have to be created in ensuring whose liable for the accidents as well as keeping people safe, it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars in many states, and to ensure the safety of pedestrians and drivers, traffic lawa will change and not just regular laws and least, they are dangerous.

So therefore, I say stick to what's not broke. The world is becoming lazy and there are certain things we need to keep to ensure safety for our citizens. The negatives outweigh the positives. The driverless cars sound just like what they are DANGEROUS!",1,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,1
"I don't think it would be worth the money to put in technology in a classroom to see what a student is feeling, because not everyone wants everyone knowing what they are feeling. What if that student just wants to be left alone? When I'm mad I don't want everyone knowing what's going on, I'd rather not talk to anyone unless I ask them for help about the situation. If they did put the technology in a classroom to tell what every child is feeling everyone would know each others business.

In the article it stated that it could help teachers know if the child is bored or confused, but does that child want the student to call him or her out on it? Probably not because if that student is struggling in class they don't want everyone knowing, if that student is struggling or confused then they need to ask the teacher at a seperate time if they don't want everyone to know how they struggle academically.

Not everyone is a emotional person they don't know how to share their feelings but they probably don't want some machine telling them how they feel and how they are feeling by how they look. Because anyone can fake a smile or a happy moment, but if that student doesn't know how to express themselves without a machine telling them, then they most likley don't want everyone else knowing what they're going through.

Technology has advanced majorly in just the past few years, but we are humans and we need to be able to show our emotions without a computer telling us how were feeling by how we look on that day. We all have bad days and we all have good days but on the bad day if that computer tells me I'm depressed then I could believe that and my mental state not be stable anymore because that computer told me I was depressed based on how I looked and felt one day.

We as humans need to learn how to express ourselves without using an emoji on our keyboards. Technology has made our lifes easier but again has changed too many things in todays world.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1
"Using this techlonogy of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful and valuable to be used in a classroom.

There's are several of reasons why It's a good idea to use this genuis technique in class.

To start off It's pretty incrible that a computer can see what emotion you are feeling. Why not use it? It'll come in pretty handy. Let's just say that a student In the class is never doing their work. They're constantly distracted and they don't show any effort. The computer can tell us what emotion the student is feeling so then that way It'll not only be helpful for the teacher to know what's going on but it'll also be helpful to the student so that the teacher helps the student not to struggle so much.

It can also help with students that are confused and aren't sure how they are feeling or mayeb they feel a lot of things at once which is very confusing a computer than can show what your feeling is a good tool. It can help you firgure out what your feeling In cas you don't know how you feel.

Same with teachers. Students can firgure out what their teacher is feeling that way they can avoid getting into trouble. If they see a teachers angry they wouldn't wanna make them more mad.

As in for students. With this cool technology it can help students find out what's going on in case they have a friend who they're worried about and they're not so sure what's going on with their friend. Well this computer can quickly help you figure out what's going on with them. Im sure your friend would really appriciate that you help them out even if it seems like they don't.

These are the reasons I think that using this computer that show what emotions you've got is simply very helpful to both students and teachers. It's a smart way in not only showing how you feel but also producing them.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,1
"What do you think about when you think of the future? Do you think that driveless cars would be the end result of being safe? Driveless cars are not safe because it makes people lazy, gets rid of all driving laws, and technology isn't always as great as we think it is.

The world is already lazy, so why would you want to make it more lazy? We already have machines, computers, and phones doing everything for us. Machines make everyday things but people get paid so much for pressing a button. Computers do everything for us. Phones answer all our questions. Now cars are going to be driving themselves. And what are the people going to do? Sit back and watch. Then all we will be doing is having everything do it for us and we do nothing.

Not only will the people be lazy, then there will not be laws like there is today. What is someone gets hurt? Who are you going to blame it on? People do what they do and how they do it for a reason. If people want to drunk drive and drive high then they should be punished for the bad things they do and not have a car doing everything for them and be as if it's a way out of trouble.

Now that there isn't much laws and we have robots doing everything for us there is only one thing we depend on. That is technology. Technology isn't the greatest.

"Did you imagine exploring venus? In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explain how Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author support the idea that Venus is a risk for humans by showing how is inhospitable, how enviroment affect humans and how temperature will affect us.

The first reason that Venus is inhospitable , because most of the spacecraft do not survived the landing for few hours. ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship hasa single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more thsan three decades."" This means that NASA has waste money just to explore one planet, since there are more planets NASA choose Venus. ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" This means that NASA will waste money just to land a spacecraft, but what happen if the land of the spacecraft suceed, NASA will keep wasting money until humans can live on Venus. This is one of the reason why the challenge of exploring Venus needs to stop because is inhospitable, humans needs money to buy important things, but NASA will waste money to build spacecraft, until one of the spacecraft land safely on Venus.

The second reson that Venus is a risk for humans is the temperature, because the temperature of Venus is different from Earth, Venus is more closer to the Sun than Earth. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahreheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This means that if humans land on Venus they will die of dehydratation because they will need too much water or they will melt because it is too hot. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system..."" This is why NASA needs to stop studying Venus because the only thing they can study is the outside, no the inside. Venus pursuit

to despair because humans wants knowledge and make history.

The final reason is the enviroment, because the only things that Venus has is land, gas and liquid that is not water. ""enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

This meas that if the pressure of Venus can crush a submarine, imagine what humans be like? ""A thicks atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.""

This means that spacecraft will take more time to land because spacecraft needs to pass first the aatmosphere of Venus. This why NASA needs to stop building spacecraft until they are sure that the spacecraft is succesfully land on Venus.

The author tells us why studying Venus should stop because it pursuit the dangers. The enviroment of Venus, the temperaature of Venus and

why is inhospitable are the three reasons the aautheor us to stop studying Venus. This is why we need to stop studying Venus because it pursuit to despair.",3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"What's your opinion on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)? If people used this system, it wouldn't be right. This might seem like a good and helpful system but if we start using it, it'll more likely upset people because not everyone is comfortable with others knowing their emotions, if everyone knows others emotions then we won't have to communicate as much because we have a machine that'll tell us, and jobs will be taken away because we will no longer need them.

Yes, this system would be quite interesting, but many people wouldn't agree with always having others know how they're feeling. They want to keep to theirselves and just think their emotions through, they shouldn't have to share them if they don't want to. In the passage, it says, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" At this point, you'd ask if she is okay. If she doesn't want you to know then she won't tell you so she shouldn't have to. If she does want to talk about it or tell you how she's feeling then she will. The person should always have an option as to whether or not people figure out how they're feeling.

Imagine the person next to you, in this case a girl, is sitting there just staring off into space, you would probably ask them what she is thinking about. If we use this system, then we won't have to ask because we'll already know if she's angry. If you already know she's angry then you wouldn't go up and talk to her, meaning we'd lose communication and that person would lose someone to talk to her emotions about (if she wanted to). In the article, it says, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" This shows that the computer will be able to detect the emotion that person is feeling so you won't have to.

In society today, we shouldn't use this system. Maybe if it was back in the day then it would be more beneficial because we didn't have as many therapists to help but now we have occupations that help us figure out how and why we're feeling certain emotions. As an example, imagine yourself as a therapist. If you're a therapist, you'd have multiple patients coming in your room on a regular basis to talk about how they're feeling, how their day was, etc. and you'd help them figure out why they're feeling happy, depressed, sad, angry, etc. The next day you look on the news and there's a new kind of computer that tells you how you're feeling, but that's your job. When you go into work, only half of your usual patients come in and the next day, the amount splits in half again. Sooner or later, you're down to very few patients but you aren't getting paid enough anymore so you have to quit and find another occupation. This is what would happen to many therapists and occupations similar because the people have a different way of seeing their emotions now.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is not a good idea. This system would make society more anti-social. We should work on finding more ways for people to come together and communicate with each other and this would do the opposite. It would make the people who do not want everyone to know their emotions upset/angry, it would make us lose communication, and some of our occupations would be lost. Those are some examples of how the FACS is not very beneficial.",3,4,3,4,2,2,3,3,3
"Driverless cars are a negative aspect in the near future. Most people buy a vehicle so they can be in control of where they are going, how fast they're going, etc. Personally i would not prefer a machine taking me places all day. Driverless vehicles may have a technical difficulty which could result in an injury, or worst case scenario, a fatality. Not only is it endangering the operator and surrounding individuals, but also the manufacturer due to reliabilty regulations.

In reality, driverless cars is a cool topic to think about, but are they completely independent? The answer to that is no, well at least for now. Driverless vehicles use a bunch of different sensors, lasers and computers to figure out which way is which and to understand their surroundings. Although the programming of these smart cars remain quite complex, they still lack the ability to handle situations such as backing out of a drive way, going through construction zones, and what to do if there is an accident ahead. You might be thinking ""So what happens if the vehicle doesnt know what to do?"" If a smart vehicle doesnt know what to do in a situation, it allows you to take over, thus making driverless vehicles not completely driverless. Don't worry though, the vehicle alerts you in multiple ways if there is an issue in which you need to take into consideration, such as blinking lights on the wind shield, the drivers seat vibrates and talking to you through the speakers. The vehicle only pays attention if you pay attention, they have sensors in the steering wheel to make sure you have your hands on the wheel at all times, and a camera above watches you to make sure you keep your eyes on the road.

The driverless vehicle can also be very dangerous. Almost one hundred percent of the time, machines/computers have some sort of mishap or technical difficulty quite often. Some may be worse than others but most of the time they always malfunction. So why would you want a possible death bound machine taking you to your everyday day errands? Supposedly that is a risk people are willing to take. They should sop with the production completely and stick with the modern day transportaion.

Having a smart vehicle drive you around all day without having to invest any effort at all would be heaven, but it is just not possible right now. Some time or another the operator will always have to take over because smart cars are unfortunately not smart enough. driverless vehicle is false advertisement. They should be titled ""Assisted smart vehicle"" or something of that sort. If they are going to continue manufacturing these vehicles then they should at least keep them off of the market until they have worked out all of the flaws.

Driverless vehicles are a good idea, but remain a complete disgrace to the world of transportation. Some people actually enojoy driving, and these machines dont allow you to do that. Driverless cars also propose great dangers to everyone in them or around them. Although they can be helpful to some people such as disabled individuals, we should stick with modern day transportation.",4,3,1,2,1,2,2,1,2
"No matter wich candidate has the most votes The Electoral College holds the final decission. Even though this makes it unfair to our voters this is a secure way of choosing the next president. Sometimes we are not smart enough to pick the right candidate ourselves. I believe that we should rely on the Electoral College. It is there to make sure that we do not get a president that might over rule and it also avoids run-off elections.

The Electoral College reduces the chance of getting a president that might have intentions of over powering. For instance in Cuba, nothing like The Electoral College exists which is why Fidel Castro is still in charge and does not give the citizens freedom. Although he may not be in full charge, he still rules through his brother. But because of him they have poor food supply, barely any money, shelter is weak, and food is scares. With the Electoral College this would be less likely to happen because the electors process everything before making the final decision. Like stated in Source number three ""voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen to the competing candidates"".

""Candidates may have won the popular vote but not won the presidency"" says source two. This makes it unfair to voters. On top of that, The Electoral College avoids Run-off elections. ""Avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" says Source three. Nixon and Clinton for example had fourty-three percent of the popular votes. For a candidate who can not run their state The Electoral College may turn off voters. When candidates seem to be tied or are about to be tied it complecates the process and so it is reduced by The Electoral College.

I support The Electoral College becuase of the reduced chance of getting a president with over powering intentions and it avoids run-off elections.",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"I think we should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. I have a couple reasons for saying that. First, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. Second, you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote.

First off, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the  president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Second, you have to worry about the ties in electoral vote. Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either.

I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of.",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,2,3
"Overtime technology has been growing more and more , affecting all of us in both good and bad ways. Many have abrupted our minds and cause issues because some appliances arent necessary or they are not ment for some particular people.

In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it tells us important information that new made auto cars are useful for us and what bad effects might come amoung us. I believe that this story is a negative impact because, when making new things such as ""technology"", it may or may not be dangerous. Things arent usually what they seem according to everybody. You might see it as a whole life changer but what some people question is, "" Is this necessary for me?"" or "" Is this safe for me and my family?"".

The cars we use now, are somewhat we call it ""perfect"" and if we use higher standard advancements of our cars, would we really rely on it? What are we capable of when using a driveless car? To me, a driveless car compares to sitting. Sitting is just another way of being lazy just like using a driveless car when you dont need to do anything but just sit there and enjoy the road.

Whats so great about driving a driveless car anyways ? Sitting there and watching the roads are no fun. How would people who like the speed and heart-pacing condtion when racing feel about this ? It would be a boring ride for me because you are not doing anything but just sit there. Yeah, there would be chances for you to be on your phone, or eating your meal rith there, or sleeping. But do we rely on such advance technology so much that we depend on it and avoid the dangerous cause?

Do we think that our children and family's are safe in a vechile that doesnt need you to drive and only drives by itself are safe enough ? Do you think this new car would be capable of rainy conditions and and snow conditions ? Yes, in the story it tells us that there would be objects just like in an ordinary car would have for you to use be in there just in case of emergencies, but why get an advance car when there are some similar alliance between the both of them? Why waist money on something that is the same? Think of how it would be with you just sitting there instaed of enjoying the road.",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Google driverless cars are something of the future right? Not anymore the company Google are and did make cars that are driverless in some aspect. They still need human control in certan situations like in passage 7 stating some accidents and work zones human interaction with the mobile vehicle is needed. In a way its much sophicated than human driving more precise as you will. In this case it would be alot more safer for us and the enviorment as they say in passage 1 saying that the cars would use half the gas we use today. Theres more pros than cons in this invention and it would be a great accomplishment to creat a car with these abilities.

Google cars are here not yet purchasable , but they are made and tested.

With this long period of time they should create the best saftey precautions in the vehicle itself. With these new features im sure that they would bring in high saftey precaution in these vehicles because this is a new era of mobile vehicles. The fact there would be less accidents and fewer human fault accidents. There would be less tickets and fewer police officers running around pulling people over. If they make this car how i am thinking they will they could change everything about the art of driving.

Less gas more money thats what we all want. More money thats what youll have after Google release these driverless cars. The bonus will be a healthier enviorment. Half the gas half the polution. The enviorment is severly important to us. The air we breath, the food we eat, the pure decorations, the way we live is based on this huge factor of the enviorment the more healthier it is the better we live. With this car great things will happen outside and inside our wallets.

Based on these facts in the article theres a definate change becoming afloat the way we live will change for a long time. We get alot of improvements when they release this driverless car the rules will change for the better. We will see our family members safer with these automibles on the market. Lets make society great again with Google Driverless Cars.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Cars have been around for many years and generations. People rely on cars for transportation. However, theres places where car usage is being limited because of the pollution it causes to the environment and help create a better environment for the people.

For for starters, one reason car usage is being limited is because of how much pollution it brings to the environment. According to article 2 paragraph 17, Paris usually has the most smog than any other European capital. The smog cleared enough for the French party to remove the ban of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This means cars have been a great cause of the smog in the city. In Bogota Colombia, thers a car-free day in act. According to article 3 paragraph 21, the goal of the day was to promote other transportation and to reduce smog. This shows that people aren't considerate when it comes to the environment and don't realize the pollution they're causing. Therefore limiting car usage is beneficial.

Another advantage to limiting car usage is that it can help create a healthier environment. According to article 2, people would participate in Day Without Cars regardless of weather. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" explained Bogota Mayor Antanas. The campaign brought constructs of 118 miles of bicycle paths. Parks and sport centers also grew. This demostrates that people are determine to make the environment they live in into a better place to live. Aritcle 4 states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses each year. This shows America is probably leaving driving for better alternatives for the environment and their lives. And limitation to car usage was a big key to this behaviour change.

Although driving has been abused for years, places are beginning to limit the usage of cars. Some of the reasons cars are being ban are due to the pollution is causes and it helps create a better environment for the city and people lives. Would limitations of car usage ever completely get rid of cars as a transportation.",3,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,1
"""Let's keep moving forward"". Walt Disney harped at the advancement of entertainment and technology in the world and constantly reminded everyone to keep moving forward in their lives and to keep an open mind with new technology. Just like with some of Diney's crazy inventions one must try the new before denying them. The Facial Action Coding System would be considered one of the new technologies that one must keep an open mind to trying. There are many useful ways that this system could help out masses worldwide. It could help between the language barrier, in courtrooms with lie detectors, and most importantly classrooms. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable and needs to be spread throughout classrooms across the globe.

Students' are very different from one another. That includes their friends, their style, their personal values, and their work in shcool. With this system it will make it extremely easier for teachers to help students' education flow a lot smoother. As said in paragrah 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is beocming confused or bored"". This recognition could allow the computer to modify the lesson without the teacher having to take time out of their busy schedule to do so. It will also benefits students who are scared to approach teachers' with their education problems because they might become embarrassed. By using this method with the Facial Action Coding System graduation rates may increase as well as classroom productivity through the help of the lesson modifications.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System should be widely encourged is it could help a teacher build a better relationship with the students. As said in paragraph 4, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". This means that when any student is having emotional stuggles their teacher could be notified by the system. This would allow the teachers to become more aware of their students' outside lives so that the teacher could help the student if needed. Doing so, a stonger trust factor could be built between the student and teacher creating a more productive classroom all together.

Some may say that this system would be an invasion of privacy for the students, but this is not much different than being able to tell how one feels by just examining their expression by oneself. This system advances the technology of facial examination only. It assists others in being able to distiguish one's feelings at the moment. Going a little deeper in the student's life may actually benefit them more than it would invade on them. The system could allow the students to recieve the help they really need by delving a little deeper than a normal human would be able to.

This system could be seen as an insane new technology that some may be afraid of, but to make progess in the world one must open their mind and accept the new to help millions around the world. The Facial Action Coding System could help a plethora of sutdents and teachers with their relationship and trust as well as the students' educations and also the teachers' careers. This system could be the new big thing in the technological advancement of schools, and it will allow more people to succeed in life and create a better future for everyone surounding them.",5,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,2
"There is talk on how there will one day be driverless cars. Companies such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan have taken interest in these type of cars. Tesla has also created a 2016 release car that autopilot can be used for ninety percent of the time. There are many supporters of driverless cars, but there are also people who completely disagree with the idea. At least three states have made it illegal to test out computerdriven cars. I do not agree with the idea of driverless cars because there are more cons than pros.

There actually are positive outcomes when talki8ng about driverless cars. The car would just take over and you would not have to do much work at all. Driverless cars have been claimed that the touch sensors that control steering, acceleration, and brakes would have more control over the car then a human. A project manager driver from BMW has stated that they are trying to make driving and car rides more enjoyable. He plans on creating in-car entertainment and placing in systems that would keep the driver and passengers more aware of their surroundings.

Although there are a few positives outcomes with driverless cars, there are more cons than pros. The cars are said to be driverless, but they still require the ""driver"" to be fully aware of what the car is doing. When the car would approach work zones, traffic jams, or working around accidents. This requires more functions that the car needs to have to be able to get the attention of the driver. Also, to have the car excel to become completely driverless is too expensive. The companies looking into driverless cars have come to realize that they can create a car that runs on a special test track that has sensors to communicate between the road and the car. They then realized that it was impractical to think that all of their problems would be solved by sensors.

Another con would be that the car would be running off of technology, which is not always one hundred percent reliable. At any given moment the car could have a malfunction and could create a dangerous situation. The car could cause a crash, which would lead to another con. If something happens to a driver and any passengers while in the car, who will be blamed? There could start to be some disputes with the auto companies about why their cars are malfunctioning or why their vehicles are losing control. This then makes the situation dangerous and it will cause more harm then it is helping.

With all of the pros and cons in mind, I remain against driverless cars. I feel as if there are more cons then pros, so it is doing more harm then it is helping. The idea is fun and some people will still support it for different reasons, such as being lazy or wanting to try something new. In my opinion, the car is far too risky and could possibly put people in a tremendous amount of danger. Safety is the main priority and I do not feel as if this meets the requirements of safe.",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear State senator,

The Electoral college is a process that was established by our founding fathers in a constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.The electoral college consists of the selection of the electors then that carries into the meeting or gathering of the electors.In that type of meeting of the electors they vote for the president and the vice president,Next is the counting of the electoral votes by congress.The electoral college consists of 538 electors,Did you know that a majority of those elector's votes are required to elect the president.Well 270 electoral votes to be exact.Well how did the number of electorals get chosen? The way that exact number got chosen is because tehere is one electoral to each member in the House of Representatives.Don't you agree that that was a wise choice? Also dont you think that our founding fathers really sat back and but real thought and effort in to a decision like this,something to put into the constitution.

Personally,I believe that the Ellectoral College should be kept in place and not depend on a popular vote to elect our president,for two reasons.The first reason is because most people who are about to vote they dont actually sit and take the time to see who they are voting for,they just ""christmas tree"" all of the options that they have. The second reason why i believe that i believe that the electoral college should stay in place because that this is a good process to have in place.

How many people do you think actually sit there and research and put thought into the president that they are chosing to run their country? Do you really belive that everyone does that? Think about the young and inexperienced voters who are fresh out of highschool and probaly just getting into college,Do you think that on top of their school work that they'll sit there and add something else on to their plate? To be completly honest i would not. I would either not vote or just pick at a random.Many people have a family and a job or jobs and have alot on their plate so the last thing they're gonna do is take the time out of their busy schedules and researchand find information on something that they dont need to do.

I also believe that the electoral college should stay in place because it's a good process to have. Having the electoral college in effect takes the stress off of the voters so they can continue on with their busy lives and not have to stand in those unreasonably long lines in the cold,hot,rain, or even snow. The people workers out in those lines are irritable and dont want to be there along with the voters,They look at it as a a waist of their time. No one likes to feel like their time was waisted because ""Time is Money"".

I hope you actually get this letter,read it,and but thought into what you just read.The Electoral college is a very good process to have in effect. Remeber that it keeps peole stress free and less irritable and if you use the Electors and not citizens you will end up getting a more educated vote because they sat back and analyzed the actions from the past of each canadate that is running and is making a vote based off of knowledge,not picking at a random.

"We should keep with changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Because it is logical and is very fair, these are my reasons why.

For one, it seems a lot more leveled out. The Electoral College is not as fair, because the electors help the president, the the president helps the electors. They could have past experience or an old relationship of some sort. Braford Plumer quotes, ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" He clearly says Electoral College needs to be abolished, over & done with. Because they don't have logical information on everything they do. And they only have practical reasoning, not liberal or conservative reasoning.

Next reason, their method is not bulletproof as they claim it to be. No method is perfect, but the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in succeeding. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..."" He is saying the way the method is set up, makes it seem worthless to even vote for the person you choose or chose.

Finally, my last reason to why we should keep with changing to election by popular vote is confusion. The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Some candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning because of the winner-take-all system. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""During 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" That is pretty selffish and ridiculously unfair.

However, having the election by popular vote has it's flaws as well. Such as the certainty of outcome. Electoral College having a dispute over the outcome of an election is possible, but it's less likely than the popular vote. Richard A. Posner quotes, ""Because almost all states award elecroral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""

He is simply stating that if there is a difficulty in the popular vote election, they have an electoral vote to choose the winner.

Those are my very important, detailed reasons why we should change to election by popular vote. Recap, fairness is important & is needed in any method, the Electoral College method is not as solid as they believe it to be, & all of the confusion the Electoral College puts off to some states.",3,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Is the face on Mars the face of a new discovery in our universe? When a face was discovered on Mars, the idea of it was quite controversial. Generally speaking, the face on Mars was just a pop icon, not a sign of life. The face on Mars was proven to be a simple landform because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to determine, there were no signs of any civilization, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. The Face on Mars was just a pop icon and a skeptic's thought, not a sign of martian life or civilization.

First of all, in 1998 when the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to find evidence, when all they found was a natural landform.

The Red Planet was very cloudy that time of year, and theorists believed that the haze was hiding any martian evidence or civilization. However, it is not easy to target Cydonia, because of Mars' natural orbit and the fog and haze Mars receives every so often. So, in 2001, NASA sent the Surveyor back up to Mars to take pictures and investigate.

When the photos were taken, the photos were discerned three times bigger than the pixel size, and no signs of civilization appeared. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program states. Each pixel in the image taken was around 2 meters, when the Viking image taken in 1976 had fourty-three meters per pixel. In 1976, the theories could have been believable, considering that the images taken did not show very much evidence if any.

Finally, the American West was compared to Mars when the ""Face"" was labeled as a butte or a mesa. The American West is sultry, gusty, and somewhat similar to what the environment on Mars is. This environment is the perfect environment to form buttes, due to erosion in the soil and the wind pushing the soil around. The landmass on Mars is not exactly a butte, however. This landmass is the Martian equivalent to what the American West has. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" says Garvin.

""There hasn't been enough evidence of the Face on Mars to prove it's only a landmass!"" There has been several images taken of the Face to prove it is a formation. However, the image taken in 2001 is the most accurate, considering that the pixels are about two meters by two meters. That is about 22 times more accurate than the picture taken in 1976, showing about fourty-three meters each pixel of Cydonia. If there were any evidence to show up on the Face, it would be shown in the 2001 image.

The Face on Mars is only a martian mesa, not a pop icon or a civilization. It is an extraterrestrial butte because NASA had photographed it from several angles showing all there was needed to prove, there were no signs of any civilization when images were taken, and the environment was suitable to form buttes or mesas. All in all, the Face on Mars wasn't a sign of out-of-this-world autotrophs, but it was just a simple bizarre-shaped butte. The Face on Mars was not only a controversy, but a resolved conflict between conspirors and Cydonia-scholars.",4,4,4,4,2,2,3,3,3
"I think we should keep the electoral vote. My reasonings are: certainty of outcome, everybody agrees with him/her, swing states, big states,and avoiding run-off elections.

There is a certainty of the outcome if we keep the electoral voting system. It will be more accurate than using the most popular vote. If the election of 2012 would have been accounted to popular votes than Barack Obama would have lost the election.

We want to have a president that believes in what we believe in. We also want a president that appeals to everyone not just one region of the United States. We want to have a president that gets things done like Obama has because we are in a lot of debt.

Swing states have a big impact on whether he/she is in office or not. They are more likely to pay a attention to their campaign than other states. They have more of an impact to whether they win the election or not.

We need big states to help win the elections. Without them the presidents wouldn't get as much electoral votes from bigger states than from the smaller states. You need more electoral votes then the opponent to win the election not just popular votes.

With the electoral college we would avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when nobody gets the mojority of the votes. With the electoral college we would be giving the presidency to the candidate who has the most electoral votes not the most popular.

So in conclusion if you have more popular votes that doesnt mean anything. If you have more electoral votes you will win the election.",2,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,1
"I think that they should get rid of the electoral college, becuase each person shoule just be able to vote who they want to be president, instead of having to vote on someone and then they represent your and they vote on the president of the united states. One of the other reasons i think the electoral college should be Abolished is that for instence say you voted for a elector, well that elector you voted for could always pick someone else instead of who you thought that they were going to pick for president. Another reason that i belive they should get rid of the electoral college is that acording to the article by

The Office Of Federal Register . most states have a ""winner take all system"" which awards all electors to the winnong presidential canidate. When you go to vote, you shouldnt have to pick an elector to elect who you want to be the new President Of The United States Of America, when you go to vote, you should just pick who you want to be president, so that you dont have to rely on someone picking who you want to be the Pesident.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

There is a lot of work, but that's not all afterwards the Seagoing Cowboys get together and do fun activites like table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, and whittling. They also play baseball and vollyball. Come and join the Seagoing Cowbays you would love it there!",1,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Driverless cars are touted as the future of society and a solution to public transportation problems in the modern world. Driverless cars utilize technology to let computers make decisions on where and when a car should move. However, driverless cars take control out of human hands. Driverless cars should be not be developed due to many obstacles in manufacturing and practical use that decrease the benefits of driving them.

One aspect of driverless cars that prevents them from being beneficial is their high cost. According to ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", roads that use a certain type of driverless car would require new wires and radio transmitters as upgrades, which would be extremely expensive. The cars themselves would utilize cutting-edge sensors, cameras, and three-dimensional projections to function, which would definitely increase the cost. The lack of control over the vehicle at all times would most likely lead to more accidents, especially if driverless cars would share the road with human-driven cars. These accidents would also raise the price of owning a driverless car.

In addition to the high cost of accidents, the decision on who is at fault for a crash in a driverless car would cause new complications in daily life.

When driverless cars do get in accident due to a malfunction, neither the owner or the manufacturer would want to claim responsibility. This disagreement will cause confusion in courts and unnecessarily add more workload to government systems that handle insurance and punishment. Eventually a consensus on who is responsible for driverless car crashes would impact the way people live. If the manufacturers were found to be guilty, then driverless cars would be made mandatory and probably more expensive in order to minimize risk of accidents and increase profits to offset the costs of crashes. If drivers were agreed to be at fault, they would constantly be on edge to make sure their car doesn't hit another car, which would defeat the purpose of having a driverless car.

The final aspect of driverless cars that make their development not worthwhile is their inability to be fully driverless. Without full automation, drivers would still need to pay attention and be able to drive at any time. According to the article, safety means a car ""has a human driver in control."" People in driverless cars would be risking their lives by trusting a computer-driven system that could shut off at any moment to give control to a human driver. Teens would still need to be trained to drive, which is expensive, but only need to apply those skills a fraction of the time they do today. The public transportation system mentioned in ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" would not only be dangerous, but probably result in people being late to their destinations due to system malfunctions or strict adherence to speed limits that people do not follow.

Driverless cars seem to be the figurehead of fuel efficient, effortless transportation. However, driverless cars have many downsides that would waste money, time, man hours, and lives. Completely automated cars would force people to put their lives at risk every day. Modern cars that are computer-assisted but not driverless are safer and allow people to be in control of their safety.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4
"I think the author did a great job explaining venus and it's many complications.

Venus has been a sister panet to us for a long time but we still have yet to properly explore it because of its harsh conditions. Venus is very hot, on average it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, so it makes it almost impossible to have anything land on it. The author explains how NASA is planning on approaching the heat.

Many people believe that Venus may have used to have been able to support life. Venus was known to have bodies of water at some point in time and has other forms of landscape like valleys, mountains, and craters.

If we could just get to Venus to check out whats going on, it could help us in the future, and i'm interested in knowing now if we ever will, i like how much information the author provided in this text",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,1
"I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboy program because you can go over sea you can be at a certian place in just a couplle weeks but it all depens on how far away it is. My reason to join this program would be that evveryone should have a chance to do things that they can't do in a normal everyday life. This started a while back I was working two part-time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when my friend Don Reist invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat. I couldn't say no. I knew that it was an opportunity of a life time.

I knew this because it isn't everyday that you can go out to sea and go to a different country. This was my only chance to help out and go to another place, but if I would have said no then I would have never of gone to Europe and I would still be at home working to jobs and not being able to do much of anything but work and work and work. At my first trip I wasn't at Europe until after I was 18 when this happened I could draft myself for the U.S. army and would be able to do this all of the time. When they got my draft they told me to keep doing what I was doing. What I was doing was feeding the animals. Then on my second trip I was on nightlook out. Every hour I had to check on the animals and make sur ethat there was nothing wrong with them. After a while it started to rain and I slid down the metal ledder and I cracked my ribs. But the best thing about this was that I could make my mark on the world. This is why I think that you should join the seagoing Cowboys.",1,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Have you ever wanted to be a seagoing cowboy? I got a chance to. It was a lot of fun. My friend convinced me to do it. You should do it also.

A seagoing cowboy is a person who takes care of animals while they are being shipped overseas. The job is to feed the animals, wash the animals, water the animals, and clean the stalls. We also get breaks. We get to go sightseeing and do things that other cultures do. The job can be hurtful. If there is a storm, the boat will get slippery and you can fall. I almost fell over board once. It was scary.

You should get this job because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Plus, the animals are well behaved and they would love to have new people. If you love to go see places in other countries, you should get this job. If you want hard work, this job would be perfect. In your free time, you can play games, read, or whittle something.

According to the article, the job is a once in a lifetime event. Based on the passage, I got to see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, a castle in Crete, and I got to see the Panama Canal. In paragraph six, it states that my job keeps me busy. Helping out on a farm or working a tough job can prepare you for the hard work. Those are some reasons of why you should be a seagoing cowboy.

Being a seagoing cowboy has some up's and down's, but overall the job is a lot of fun. You get to experience and see so many things. Sometimes, it doesn't feel like work at all. It feels like fun. A whole lot of it. Now do you want to be a seagoing cowboy?",2,3,1,3,3,2,2,1,3
"Luke bomberger is my name. I am here to provide exaples and state facts to make you want to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. This program is about helping people that got left in ruins not just after World War II. They help people if they need animals they will bring you animals from other countrys and if they need help building there houses and everything will bring you people that can build houses and better things!

Some reasons why you would want to join is because do you want to get drafted to the army? I don't think a lot of people do. So be a Seagoing Cowboy. If your with us you will not get drafted. Do you like animals you can help us by taking care of the animals. Another reason why you would like to join is because we have fun after we are done with everything we play table-tennis,fence,read,box,whittle,vollyball, and we also play baseball now doesn't that sound fun.""I don't even know what whittling is but i've done it before I think it's fun!""

That is why me,Luke Bomberger want you to join the Seagoing Cowboys. Also its not just work and play we also learn and get to vist a lot of cool places around the world. I crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice. It made me more aware of people in other countrys and their needs. Thats why I leaded my family to host a number of international of students and exchange vistors for many years. Thank you and good-bye.",2,2,2,1,0,0,1,1,0
"The artical is about the planet Venuse. It is also know as the Evening Star or the

Earths twin. Venuse is aover 800 degrees fahrenheite and a 97 precent carbon dioxcide blanket over it. The conditions of Venuse are so bad that they could crush a submarine.

The evedence that supportes this artical is when its talking about how NASA is getting involved. NASA has had an idea to send humans and study Venuse. it also talkes about how they have a blimp like vehicle hovering about 30 miles over Venuse. It talkes about if they sent any vehicle to Venuse it would have to avoid the harsh ground.

Scientst are furthering there study on Venuse because they are fascinated by it. The reason there so interested on it is because it is the most earth like planet in our solor system. The planet has vallys, mountains, and creaters which give it that earth look. It has frequent lightning strikes, powerfull earthquakes, and valcanic eruptions.

When the auther is talking about Venuse he thinks that its still a good idea to study it nomatter what the dangers are. He thinks that our traves from eartth and beyond shouldnt be limited just beause of how bad the danger is or how bad the conditions. that we should be able to exspand to meet the varry edges of our imagination.

In conclusion we should be alowed to let our imaginations run willed. NASA looking ito sending man kind to Venuse. It is the planet that is the ost earth like is several ways. NASA has been studies Venuse for a while now and have found evidene of erth like structures on it.",1,2,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Anytime someone goes out in public they are more than likely on camera. Technology is becoming more and more advance every day and it has a lot of good benefits. This article talks about a new technology called the Facial Action Coding system. The use of this technology reading the students expressions in a classroom is valuabe because it can adjust lessons to their need, can tell if something is wrong, and can read almost all emotions they are feeling.

The use of Facial Action Coding is valuable in the classroom because it can adjust lessons to the students needs. In the article the author says "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" This show that this technology would help all students learn in a way that benefits them and not be confused in class, but afraid to say anything. Each student learns at their own pace and by sitting infront of these computers they can learn and actually enjoy learning.

Having this type of technoloy in the classroom is really beneficial because it can tell if something is wrong. In the article it states ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This show that if a student in the classroom is being bullied or going through bad things at home the computer can read that and send some type of alert out to the teacher. This benefits the student because they teacher would be able to sit down with them and help figure out a way to solve his/her problems or how to seek help.

Using the Facial Action Coding technology in the classroom is very valuable because it can read more than one emotion they are feeling. In the article the author states ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows that when a student sits infront of the computer it will analyze every part of their face to find how much they are feeling of each emotion. Reading all their emotions is quite beneficial because if they suddenly get very angry or sad they teacher could be notified and they could be pulled out of class to ask what is wrong instead of causing a big scene.

Finally, the Facial Action Coding may have its flaws, but it comes out on top with pretty good benefits especially for students. Putting this in classrooms could save a lot of bad things from happening and help our sociecty grow stronger and more intelligent. Giving this a try could be the beginning to a new and better future for kids all over.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,3
"In the Article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" the most major advantage citizens can have on limiting car use is taking part in keeping our Ozone safe. By constantly driving humans are making pollutions on Earth. There are many different ways these pollutions can have an effect on citizens. One being direct rays from the sunlight beaming down on the Epidermis. Another, being clouds filling up with smoke and looking dis-colored.

By walking citizens have a bunch of advantages. Excercise is a must in certain cases . Cities are embracing the fact that we can stay healthy while limiting pollution. Germany has come up with a convienent solution: build everything that is needed by citizens within walking distance. People are moving to areas like this just to get away from driving. In other places like Paris, they are creating a ban on certain days. Once Paris' smog build-up began to rise they knew something had to be done. To slove this problem drivers were to stop driving until the smog was gone. Citizens were only allowed to drive if they carpooled. Public Transportation was free for the whole week.

In Bogota, they started on this project by creating 118 miles of bicycle paths. Other cities began to get so exited that they traveled to Bogata to see the wonders of this way. The bicycle lanes have made a huge improvement on rush-hour trafic. It is said that walking would relieve stress in many areas.

Walking has also effected the American communtiy. Less cars are being bought and so are less drivers licenses being obtained as the years go by. Researchers are asking if America has passed its urge for driving peak. People that dont drive will actually hurt companies. Multi-Million dollar companies like Ford and mercedes will start to loose funds due to this decision. America is all about mobility and if this starts to decrease then so will the profit of these places.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"As we get older we want to travel to more places and get there faster, what if their was a quicker way without using cars. Certain places have been introducing a new concept, they calll themselves suburban pioneers. They live in places that have little or no cars, besides for the occassional bus, and all the stores that they would normally drive to are much closer now. Their are many benificial points to this new way of life such as a dramatic drop in greenhouse gasses, a stress free way to live, and also who doesn't desire to save a buck or two. If people start to limit the usuage of cars this planet might actually become a safer more joyful place to live.

In the past years greenhouse gasses have skyrocketed. The ozone layer is now trapping car exhaust fumes in earth and leading to what some might call global warming. Summer becomes hotter and longer, vice versa with winter. The U.S alone is  to blame for up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emission. In europe it's 12 percent which is still quite a grave deal. Causes of not cutting back on the use of cars leads to tragic events such as the one that unfolded in Paris. Thier was so much smog in the air from motorized cars that for five days no one could start their cars unless they had a wish of paying a pricey fine. If people start to diminish the use of cars we can restore this humble planet to its former glory.

Forking out money for a car and having the luxory of fixing it up everytime a piece falls off or something malfunctions can become expensive quite rapidly. Who doesn't crave to save money anyways? Those who have chosen the suburban pioneer way of living have saved enormous enough of money. They don't have to pay for the insurance of the car and they don't have to pay to fix up the ole' rust bucket. Though some would rather have a car, but those who drive do the honors of car pulling which might not be the most time saving mechanism but in the long run it truely is beneficial. Also the government gains from all this. The government pays to build highways and roads for your car, but if cars aren't so common as time goes by roads get shorter and people start to get paid more because of all the money that the government is saving. Though money can't make us happy is still is an important piece to own in life.

In retrospect cars cause a lot of stress related problems. Everyone has one of those days where they wake up late and then suddenly remember that they have to get across town in a few minutes. Yes a car could get you there in less than no time, but wouldn't it be much simpler if you could just walk a closer distance. With the desecration of cars, stores and outlets would be much closer to your home. The stress of forgetting something at home and then having to drive 30 minutes to go get it would be diminished. Families could have more interaction with each other which means a closer bond could be formed. Receting the number of cars wouldn't be such an inhuman thing to do if you knew that the outcome was far more appealing.

To sum up, limiting the number of cars that roamed this earth would be more of a gain than a loss. Cars create hazardous gasses that are released into the air that are slowly but surely rendering us useless. Cars also cause safety hazards that can lead to a stressful environment. Plus if you don't use a car as often or get rid of it all together you can retain money for more important matters such as bills for your house or maybe a well deserved vacation. The posibilities are endless if we begin to limit the use of cars.",4,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Do you think aliens exsist? The face has been said to be a natural landform or made by aliens. The face has been told from different perspectives. Conspiracy theorists thinks NASA wants to hide the face, when they really dont. There's different stand points for different topics.

The Face on Mars is a mystery because we dont know if the face is there or is it shadows. In my opinion I think that the face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. the face has also been seen as a pop icon, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Defenders of the national budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Maybe there is life maybe there's not who knows for sure.

Eighteen long years after Viking missions, we sent up the Global Surveyor. Once the it was in place for a good shot we took it ten times which were sharper than the viking photos. After the photos were posted on the web there was no congergations about aliens anymore. It was proven to be a natural landform after all. But not everyone was satisfied with the pictures.

The Face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian lattitude where it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. People still thought that it was an alien making that was hidden in the clouds. The team got another great look at it with the clearest view ever on a summer day and snapped a photo. The photo actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Still think its real or not?

In my opinon I believe the Face is real. Others might argue that its still something crated by aliens. Especially sense it was clearified as a butte or mesa. No matter what its an opinon based topic that you can argue about all day. The real question is what do you think?

In conclusion there has been plenty of research and examinations on the Face of Mars. I still think that the Face is real, others might think differently. This topic can go both ways in opinon wise. Think wise about this topic. Consider talking about it with coleagues and come up with a conclusion for this topic.",1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"I disagree a little bit that there's gonna be driverless cars in future. I know that there will be more electric cars to preserve more gas.

There are advantages with driverless cars. There will probably be less accidents, have less careless drivers out in the streets. It'll have sensors to where if someone backs up to something to close the car will automatically hit the brakes. Driverless cars will probably have a better and engine and suspension system. But i just dont think that driverless cars are gonna do the trick because what if the car breaks down out of nowhere and you cant start it back up or what if you have to drive manually and the steering wheel doesn't work? What are you going to do? I would prefer more on electric cars than driverless cars because you wouldn't have no worries about gas money or anything like that.

But I would probably go more towards elcetric cars to save gas because driverless cars you would still need gas money .",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"I think that self-driving cars can be a good and a bad thing. They can make driving safer, but they can also make it more dangerous.

I am in favor of self-driving cars if the problems can be corrected. So far the cars being made by Google are not completely self-driven. There still has to be a driver behind the wheel to take control when needed. A self-driven transportation system would be beneficial to people who need to be taken somewhere. It would be a great improvement. It would help in an emergency situation, such as if someone is injured, they are alone and cannot drive, the car can pick them up and get them medical care.

The self-driving cars also would improve the economy by reducing gas milage. The cars do not take up as much gas as other cars. The improved economy would allow for more money to be put into important projects that can benefit people and improve the world. The car sensors would also reduce the number of accidents. If people don't get into car crashes or accidents, there are no medical bills to pay, leaving more money for the driver for important exspenses.

People having more money can lead to a better life, such as paying for college, or a new home.

The self-driving cars are our key to the future, a better world. The cars improve life by saving money and by not using as much gas, reducing pollution, providing better air to breathe. There needs to be more research done to complete a fully-automated car, this new transportantion system needs to be put into place as soon as more can be done to fix the issues the cars are having. So in conclusion, The sooner the problems are fixed and the cars are being produced, the better life people will have thanks to driverless cars.",2,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating that Venus once had a ocean cover on it. Also that Venus once maybe had a kind of life form on it.

In the article it says that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" what that means is that we can build a blimp like vechicle to move ontop of Venus to gather rocks, or even dirt to take back and study. In the article it says that Venus and Mars are our sister planets. Venus also has a tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit which makes it really difficult to get to. but scientist think that Venus is worth the risks.

Venus being called the ""Evening Star"" is misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Its just really bright that even amature stargazers can spot it. Also scientists want to study Venus becuase its the cloest planet to Earths density, and size. And they want to know if it is abke to hold life on its surface again.

Venus is worth the pursuit because theyre so many benefits to finding out what Venus brings to us. Making Venus livable will make an huge stamp on the histoy of space science.",1,2,2,1,0,1,0,0,0
"We all plan to get cars when we get our licenses right? Wrong! The relationship between people and cars throughout the Earth is changing with fewer people buying cars and governments supporting the use of more eco-friendly methods of transportation. Two advantages of this change that I would like to point out is first the improvement in health, and second the fact green house gasses have gone down. These may seem like great ideas, but you may be asking yourself are such advantages possible?

Begining with the lack of pollution, cars can produce Carbon dioxide which causes problems in the atmosphere. The gas traps sunlight creating greenhouse gasses which is responsible for global warming. This would cause problems for future generations with an increase in flooding and other factors that can destroy areas of living, not to mention the fact breathing in the fumes is bad for health. The scary part about the relationship between green house gasses and cars is that twelve percent of green house gasses caused by cars are in Europe. This may no frighten you, but when you take into account fifty percent of green house gasses lie in the U.S., you realize how seroius and frightenning the situation really is.

Another benefit of the lack of car usage is the improvement of public health. It's known by many scientist and psycohlogist that an increase in stress is bad for health and can lower a person's life expentancy. In Vaubun Germany a mother's words about their Vaubun progam was ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" meanwhile in Bogota, Columbia a bussiness man said ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" during Bogota's car-free day program. Aside from the stress, people are getting far more fit as they walk or take a bike to their destionations, even in large cities like New York where you'll see people joining bike programs. Bicycle lanes are increasing greatley and in Bogota, 118 miles have already been built.

In conclusion, I would like to point out that out our world is improving. The awareness of government and the people has lead into the creation of bicycle lanes, a lowering in the stress level of the people, and a decrease in green house gasses. This will in turn provide a better future for countless generations of people throughout the entire planet. It's as Bill Ford, executive of the Ford Motor company stated ""pedestria, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.""",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Cars are not something that have to be used everyday. Limiting car usage could be a good thing to do. Minimizing car usage gives you the opportunity to have more parks and fun places to go without the parking lot taking up all the space.

Less space for parking makes everything more easier to get to which is an advantage instead of having to walk in the parking lot . For example, "" . . . make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ). This explains that if you get rid of the cars theres more space to park and everything else becomes easier to get to versus having many parking spaces taking up room and causing traffic and other things. Also with not using cars theres more room for small stores and big stores to be put in different places that couldnt be put there because of cars so you could drive. For example, "" . . . stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" ( In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, Elisabeth Rosenthal, Paragraph 6 ) and "" Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour retsrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky, Paragraph 28). This shows that now there's more spaces for even more stores which is an advantage because the cars used to take up that space used for bigger roads for more cars to come on but without that problem theres room for other thing's.

Also it's a good way to save money because it decreases smog, and air polllution. For example, "" Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."" ( Paris bans driving due to smog, Robert Duffer, Paragraph 14).  This shows that after France decided to stop using cars the smog decreased tremendisely. Having no vehicles can also make the environment better because there wouldnt be a lot of carbon being produced. For example, "" . . . it will have a benificial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" ( The End of Car Culture, Elisabeth Rosentha, Paragraph 34). Which is an example of how it could better for the environment. An advantage also is there will be less pollution. For example, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution . . ."" This explains that it would be a good thing for us , we would have better breathing and also again a better environment .

In Conclusion, Minimizing driving usage could lead to better things such as less pollution, a better environment , and lastly more room for other things . So theyre are many advantages to minimizing driving usage, it's not so bad.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"I believe there should not be driverless cars. I think it should not because the driver would not be in full controll of the car, a mistake can happen where the driverless car could mess up and something happen.

As of now in our world people have full controll of ther cars and can manuver within their cars. With driverless cars they say a humans would still need to pay attention because of traffic situations, accidents, and more. If that's the case than their might as well not be any driverless cars because the driver technicallly still needs to be alert. However if their is to be driverless cars than the driverless car should be able to do everything it self; like get though traffic jams, drive into drive ways, and back up, but all by it's self. That would be a driverless car. If a driverless car can't do that than they should just stick to manual cars for humans can do everything.

Mistakes are common. One little thing could be missing in anything and a mistake can occur. For driverless cars to happen that involves a lot of work with machinery, and electricity. If a driverless car is in a situation and something happens where the wrong wire or anything is missing it could all go bad there. Humans basically have full controll over the regular car such as steering, braking, and if anything goes wrong it will likely be the human who does the mistake.

Driverless cars sond cool, but to be safer i think the human should be in full controll of the vehicle to stay safe on the road. Driverless cars should not be on the roads for the future, because the human will not have full controll.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The ""face"" on Mars was not created by aliens however it is just a natural landform that was created. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

The land form known as the ""Face on Mars"" is just a Mesa. On Earth we have these mesas too. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

Even though it may look like an artifact its not because it was just formed like that. The mesa has nothing to hide becaus eour satelights have take many pictures of this mesa and this is no evidence of an alien presence on Mars. There are no sybols of any kind on or near the face or shacks or anything that could lead to the conclousion that aleins had built the face.

This is my evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a common landform that was misconceived as a face of sorts built by aliens. Even though it may just be a common landform it is hard to belive this is not an artifact from an anceint civilization that lived on Mars.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"The technolology to scan your face and tell your emotions is kind of creepy. Having a machine in class to tell teachers how the students are feelling is just a little weird to me but it also could be very usefull. In the text it states that the software in the computer could see if you are confused and will change the lesson so the student will better understand.

The main reason why this is creepy to me is it reminds me of the Movie Tremator. In the movie Arnald Swartsnager comes back to the past to protect the future leader of the human rebelian aginst the superior robots they have built. Well to make a long story short the robot that Arnald Swartsnager plays can scan Robert Oconner's face and asked him why is your face leaking. Yes I know this technology is far more advanced than the movie ,but that is how I can relate.

I can also relate to how the computer could tell if you are confused and change the lesson so you can learn the way you do. In the text it states the computer can tell if you have a fake or forced smile or a guinine smile by the rincles under your eyes. The text also said you can probly tell what mood your friend is by the look on their face,but the person could be hiding their true emotions from you so the computer can tell if you are mad at that person at that time and place.

In the story the author includes how most video games and surgery cames have non verbal comunications,and how your home computer could never process this information like how your feeling that day.

I personaly would like to have this technology in our classrooms,and our homes. This would help out alot of men. For an example its your one year weading anaversery and you ask your lovley wife what she wants to eat. A simple question,but you rember that she can never tell you where she wants to eat. Or the example your kids come home acting odd you ask what is wrong but you dont get a responce. So you go in to there school computer and watch what mood he or she is in.

So I have told you my thoughts on the subject time to recap. I first thought it was odd and kinda scarry due to it reminding me of a movie and the robots. Then we relised that this technology can be great for the students who dont fo very well in school becaouse they do not get the lesson.",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Dear senator,

Getting ride of the Electoral College would change so many things. We the people vote for who we want as a president. It should be that the person with the most votes wins. We the people should have a say in who runs our country. I mean we do because we get to vote and all but even if we do vote the Electoral College votes diffrently. Just becasue they and you are in higher power shouldnt mean that you get to pick everything that happends to this country. Yes, I understand that there are really stupid people in this world who make stupid dicisons but we should at least get a vote on like new laws or building something new in town. If we had votes on things like getting stuff torwn down and building new things it would change atol of places. But becauser of the Electoral College we dont have a final say in anything. During the presidency electon one of the candidates will win by the votes of the people but lose beacuse the votes of the Electoral College. That is not right. When the people vote for something or someone they should be able to have a final say in what happends. Say your voting for a new ice cream flavor, well say there is 20 regular people voting and there is 5 from th e""electoral college"". Say 13 of you like the new flavor but the other 7 dont like it. Wouldnt you think the 13 should win? But the 5 electoral people still have to vote, and 3 of them vote against the new flavor so there is no new flavor. Wouldnt you be mad if you and the other 12 people who wanted the new flavor didnt win because of higher people above you said no? i know i would. Im giving you all these reasons why the electoral college isnt fair because it needs to change.",1,3,0,2,0,0,1,2,1
"Imagine being stuck in traffic again for the fifth time this week. You glance at the time and you see that you're running late for work again. Cars can cause alot of problems like for example, people get into many car crashes that kill many innocent children or bystanders, the traffic jams always take hours to clear up, and the exhaust in the tail pipe is polluting the air. There are many advantages to limiting car usage. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air.

Although cars may come in handy they can be a real pain to have. Like for insatance paying car insurance every month, paying for gas, and paying for your car if anything breakes and needs a new part If the car usage was limited there will be more people on bikes and walking. This is good for the residents because they are spending less money and they are getting excersise from this. In Vauban, Germany the residents there have given up their cars. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars (Rosenthal, 3). There only transportation there is a tram that runs though Freiburg (Rosenthal, 2). This helps residents there get to place to place eaiser.

Also with the car limitations there will be a whole lot less traffic on the roads. For example in Paris, France they made even numbered license plates residents leave their cars at home, then the next day odd numbered license plate residents (Duffer, 11). Even though they tried to ban the cars there were 40,000 drivers fined due to driving their cars (Duffer, 12). Also when this rule was put into place there was less traffic in the capital of France. The traffic went down by 60% (Duffer, 14).

Most importantly there will be less pollution in the air. Residents in cars dont really know how much pollution is put into the air when they drive. The exhaust from the tail pipe of a car is causing a huge defect in this earth's greenhouse effect. In france the pollution was so bad there was smog in the air from all the cars (Duffer, 14). The smog in France was as bad as the world's most polluted cities in the world, Beijing, China (Duffer, 14). Also in Bogota, Colombia there was really bad smog, but after the car limitation there was a huge decrease in the smog (Selsky, 21).

In conclusion, there are many advantages in car limitation. The advantages are there will be more people on bikes and walking to place to place, less traffic, and less pollution in the air. With less cars this will help our earth big time because the greenhouse effect will stop getting car exhaust pumped through there. Also we may fine alternate ways to replace gas and oil to make this world healthier.",3,4,4,4,2,2,2,3,3
"Driverless cars. Once yesterday's dream is slowly becoming reality. Driverless cars are on the horizon. There's certainly good reason to be excited, but these unpiloted vechicles are still a good while off, if they are to live up to the first word in their name, ""driverless"". Driverless cars should only be used if the car itself can handle the vast majority of the problems it would face on the road.

Truly driverless cars are driverless, not requiring a driver at all. Today's driverless cars can only perform under few conditions, one being able to handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour. Certainly not ideal in today's society. They need to notify the driver when the road requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. Driverless cars should only be used if the car can handle 95% or above of the driving functions. Getting the driver's attention constantly would be very annoying to the driver, who bought the car so they wouldn't have to do any driving in the first place. Some situations are understandable, I'm sure most drivers would agree, but I would not want a ""driverless car"" if it can't drive itself. The people interested in these types of cars would want entertainment so they don't have to just stare out the windshield the whole ride, so entertainment options should be available while not sacrificing safety. An added bonus of appealing to a larger market would be to have the option to turn off the artificial driving, and control the car yourself. Not only could it be deadly if something went wrong, but totally relying on the car doing the driving for you, after some time, would ensure that your driving skills are low, thus even more danger if the car malfunctions. Traffic laws currently are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Those laws will change if driverless cars can prove themselves to handle situations on the road, safely. On the issue of liability, we should let laws be put in place before the cars are released to the general public. That way, there is no question who's falt it is if someone's driverless car hits a driver controlled car, one with no option of being driverless or vice versa.

In conclusion, driverless cars should only be released if they meet the safety standards necessary to meet government regulations, while providing the consumer with entertainment, that can easily be turned off by the car if there is a rare situation the car cannot meet. These cars are the cars of the future. Why not make them the best that they can be?",3,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,3
"The Value of Students Emotions

I'm going to be talking about the technology that is able to read the emotional expressions on peoples faces. I don't think it's important for them to get that technology in class rooms. I'm going to be listing off ideas on why I think its not important for schools to get this technology. My first topic is going to be about how teachers are really interested in how the students feel about what they are learing. My second topic is going to be about how students usually give there opion on how they feel about there learning. My third topic is going to be about how they could use the money for something else other than that technology.

My first topic is teachers don't really care about how students feel about what are learning. What I mean by that is teachers don't care if the students like the topic are they just care about if the students are learning and understanding. Sometimes teachers can tell by students faces if they're liking the topic or not. Sometimes teacher will ask the students if they like the topic or not but they don't really care if they do. So then like what's the point in spending money on something like that.

Usually students will give their opion on the topic. I know I give my opion and I know other students to do to. Students don't want their faces to be scanned and told how they are feeling. I know I wouldn't want mine scanned. Everybody knows how they feel at school even teachers know how students feel at school. Sometimes teachers will ask the students how they feel at school and people will tell them the truth.

Schools could use the money for something else other than a face scanner. They could use the money for things that need fixed in the school. Like the roof it's been leeking they could fix that. Buy new things for the P.E. classes like balls or rackets. They could use the money to fix the cafetiera or buy new books with the money. They could spend the money on fixing the bathrooms or the lockers things like that is what they could spend there money on.

This is why I think they should not buy the scanner. I know it sounds cool and everything but I think it would not be a good idea to buy. It would be very awkward to up to a students face and just scan it during class. People won't like that I know I won't like that. It would also be a waste of time because what if just stopped working you would have to fix it or it stopped working all the time it would take a long time to fix.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, I feel this way because it can help on so many ways. In the text kids would ask if this machine really worked, like tthey were intrested in knowing what it was. The computer can help with teachers because if the students are feeling down or something is wrong with them, the system can see whats going on and what type of mood their in so you can try and make them feel better. It also says that the facal expressions are universal, and that using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements. Thats another way why I feel like this system is helpful to students in a classroom. This system can go so far with so many different things dealing with all types of emotions including mixed emotions. It also goves you examples on how a computer will know if your sad or not, and alot of students in a classroom would find that satisfying. One example to that is saying if you smile whena web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad as the first one might follow. But if you frown, the next ad while appear to be different on your screen. I find that so amazing, that theres so many ways in the electronic community just to come up with new out of the world things, and this is one of them. For that, I feel like yes this system is valuable to students in a classroom. But not just one classroom of students, but students from all over the worls. I feel like they would love it and how it works. Not alot of children have the opportunity to try out systems like these, so if they had the chance I think they would take the opportunity in showing that this system is good for everyone. It doesn't even just have to be students , it can also be adults too! I feel like they would also love the system.",1,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0

The reason why I have chosen this is because havind driverless cars could be a big terrible deal. For example , the car has a mind of its own but what if some day it has a glich and you are inside the car, the glich will seel the doors and windows. When you know the whay to go, turning right at a stop but the glich or mistake it makes the auto go to the left.

I injoy driving, I would not like to be lazy and not learn the street names or where my destination. The driverless cars learn everything for you, how are you going to invite a friend from outside who does not have a drierless car.

"Dear State Senator,

I read all these articles about some states having to vote for the president's electors. They say basically when your voting for a president, your voting for his/hers electors. My opinion is there should be no need for electors. It should be easy and not too complicated. A presdient, a vice president, and a secatary. No electors or nothing. I think a president can do alot of his own work and think of ideas alone. If he need help than instead of us wasting our time with voting for people to give the presdient ideas and help him out. Well the President always say's God Bless America. Shouldn't the President be listening to the voices of his country. America. Yes, I think the candidate with the most votes should win. But, If they say that their going to do something for our country than they need to keep their word. Make it a better place not for himslef but for everyone. For instance, Barack Obama. What's the need for this unessarcy work that he has done. America is loosing their mind and doesnt know what's going on. Why is he doing this? The president is to make smart decent relevant choices. And if he listen to the voices of Americans than he would have lots of ideas lots! Instead he listens to who? His electors. People complain saying to themselfs, Where does he come up with these ideas? Well if you payed close attention to the presidents background and know what he really wants to do than you would know why. Honestly to me I dont think the Electoral College should keep going its just a bunch of mess that just doesnt make sence. Elelctors dont matter to most American's. Take the electors and the Electoral College away we dont want something we dont need. All we need is a President, a Vice Presdient, and a Secatary.

"Dear Senator,

According to an excerpt titled ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the Electoral College is a process established by the founding fathers in the Constitution ""as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""(Source 1.1) This process consists of a selection of 538 electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress with a majority of 270 needed to be elected president. (Source 1.2-3)

The system of Electoral College is one of much controversy as to what to do with it. Keep it or toss it? 'Tis the question. According to an excerpt of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, a Gallup poll taken in 2000, says that over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the one we have now. Apparently, the electoral college has failed us throughout the years because of the unfairness it can sometimes have. One example being presidential candidate, Al Gore, who was cheated out of his postion by the electoral college. The electoral college has caused ""close election(s) in which the popular vote winner can again lose the presidency"". (Source 2.9)

On the contrary, In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, an excerpt by Richard A. Posner, has a point when it says that when the people vote for the President they're actually voting for a slate of electors, thus each party votes for the electors who are trusted to vote for the right nominee. It says that very rarely has this trust been betrayed, only happening in 2000, when Gore was hijacked of his position, and centuries earlier in 1888. (Source 3.15-16)

So to keep or toss the Electoral College? 'Tis the question indeed, but the Electoral College has been proven to operate well enough for everyone for the past few centuries since the Constitution was made and the presidents were elected. It was said to fail us in the future but through 44 presidents it has only failed us a few times. Maybe we don't need to see the Electoral College in a black and white, keep it or toss it fashion but think to shape it so the system works better and in favor of the people with fewer kinks.

"If you like to join programs and to help out with people who need help then you should consider joining Seagoing cowboy. why you should join is because seagoing cowboys have helped many countries that have been left to ruin and if you join you could have the chance to help the ruined countries who need help through disaster. Also meeting the needs of other people and seeing the needs of other countries.

UNRRA is a group of 44 nations joined together to form United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation. UNRRA has hired Seagoing cowboys to help with their program for example in 1945 World War 11 was over in Europe, and many were left to ruin. In that case UNRRA and seagoing cowboys helped by taking care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. So meaning that they helped even though it was a very long project.

"Dear State Senator,

I agrue in favor of keeping the Electoral College, for this reason it wouldhave to be the fact that it is a much easier method electing presidental canditates. At times I know it can be unfair to most of the voters around the nation but this way is more easier than it might already seem. Instead of the people voting for which they think is the new president, it would be more likely the electors who elect the president for the state. These slate of electors are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. For some states it wouldn't be just random it be either democratic, or republicians. When having the electors it wouldbe possible to be the winner of the electoral vote but not the national popular vote.

For the president's chance of winning having an Electoral College will exceed his share of popular vote. An example would be the election backin 2012, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared 6to what Romeny had because most of the states awarded the eletoral votes on the winner-take-all basis, can get a chance of having victory in winning the electoral vote. But there would be a possible chance of having a tie against the states.

Another reason for this debate would have to be the reason that the candidates themseveles have to get the regional appeal from the states. For Romeny that gave him an opporunity but had little to offer. He no electoral votes in the states that he knowshe will win. For this unsuccessful result, Romeny only had regional appeal there for he was less likely to successed in the southern region. For other states that felt as if their votes didn't count, so there for assumed that Romeny had little interest, leading to the thought of an unlawful candidate. Swing states on the other hand have a chance of making it. The reason for that being is voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign knowing that they are going to decide the election. On avergae they are are thought of as the most thoughtful voters (the result is that they have recieved more information and attention from the candidates.

Electoral Colleges balance the weight in political balance that larger states lose virtue of the Senate. For Obama he won that vote based on the amount of electoral votes he recieved from Florida was 29. Also 3 from the state of Wyoming. In other reasons, larger states recieve the most attention from the candidates than the small states do.

Based on the information I have provided you in this statement, I will concluded that sometimes this method can be a little complicated to most voters in the U.S. For the reason is that most of the smaller states remain unseen by the candidates of the elections but sometimesend up winning thepopluar vote for the candidate they chose. In the beginning in starting the Electoral College was held by our founding fathers of this great nation. There for this methodshouldremain as it should. Thank you for your consideration.

"This piece is about why scientist should explore Venus. The author supported his or her claim of exploring Venus well. The author provides evidence to counter Venus's harsh conditions.

The author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous planet. For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author provides evidence in that scientists are currently working to combat Venus's harsh conditions. The evidence present shows that it is possible to counter the planet's harsh conditions and also how close the humans are to being able to explore Venus.",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Have you ever wondered what it is like in Venus and how we might be able to study more about it. Studying Venus closely is worth the risk for more information on Venus. With the information it could lead scientists into making better technology to explore mars or other planets. The exploration could also be our backup Earth if the current Earth in inhabitable. With all the risk it may not be possible to explore Venus but if you are determined to find the answers then it could be possible.

There would be all sorts of information if we studied Venus closely. There are a lot of problems but it is still possible. There are a lot of people that wants to know more about Venus. For example on paragraph 4 it states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is stating that Astronomers know that one day Venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties.

The information just from Venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system. With the information we could possibly find another earth-like planet faster or easier. On paragraph 8 it states, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote is stating that our curiousty will soon take us over and eventually humans will do anything to findout more about Venus or anything in general. I believe that someday we will be able to find the truth about Venus and more information or data that can help us with exploring other planets.

All of us have thought of what will happen if the current Earth we live on is destroy or inhabitable. Well our 2 options are either Mars or Venus, if we knew more of the planet Venus and how it behaves. On paragraph 4 it says that, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This is stating that Venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations.

In conclusion we have wondered how things are in Venus. We even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to Venus. There would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. With all those information we got from visiting Venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets. The Venus we know as of right now could be different as we learn more about it and find a way to change it closley to Earth.",3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Voting has been a legal write of all people since our country was established, but is the way we vote recieving some resistance? The electoral college is the way we vote now and the way weve been doing it for years. So why change it? For the sake of fairness and accuracy. People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors.

Our best arument we have to go against the electoral college is the disaster factor. Document 1 ""

What Is the Electoral College?

"" states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is basically saying we can't trust our electors to really vote for what they are assigned. That is like not being able to rely on the school bus to take you to school in the morning, its not a great sense of doubt.

Another reason not to use this outlandish method of voting is that the total number of electoral votes (538) is an even number. Which means there could be a tie. Another thing worth mentioning is that one candidate can win the popular vote but have fewer electoral votes. That is exactly what happened to Al Gore and that was largely part of this bogus system our country continues to uphold.

The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is a original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or its boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not feeling well. So you now not to push the students buttons.

The students point of view is that it will be way more better .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an affective human instructor.''My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help alot,so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they end up giving us.''Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but also may even help produce them.''Not even does this idea help you produce feelings like (happy,sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but even tells the teachers what you feel also.

''You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking by the look on your face.'' i wish we had this idea at my school but we dont.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial that conveys happy,worried,etc..'' I know how i feel when im sad because it is not a good feeling . We know how we feel we just have trouble saying it to teachers or others. With this idea we can actually say how we feel without even saying anything.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Many authors write about how we should do certain things even if they don't apppeal to us or seem possible. Authors are supposed to support their claims. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy puruit despite the dangers well.

First, the author talks about Venus is almost like Earth's twin. In paragraph 2, he states how Venus is similar to Earth in many ways. One way is how they have similar sizes and desities. He also says Venus is sometimes the closest planet to Earth.

Second, the author states the challenges and solutions to them. In paragraph 3, he states that, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 900 degrees Fahrenheit..."" His solution is to fly above the surface where its still pretty hot, but nothing compared to the surface. He also states how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. His solution for that is also flying above it because high enough would be similar to Earths

Third, the author talks about how NASA is working on ways to vist Venus. In paragraph 7, the author states that NASA is testing things in atmospheres similar to Venus's. So far, they've stayed in a few weeks before being destroyed. He talks about how mechanical computers could survive it. Modern computers are destroyed easily with the extreme conditions of Venus, but mechanical ones that use cogs wouldn't be destroyed as easily.

"I'm a scientist at NASA and me and a group of scientist have been discussing the face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. While Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible lading sites of his sister ship Viking 2. He had spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Viking 1 snapped a photo of it and sent it to the Jet Propulsion lab.

A few days later the NASA unveiled the image for all to see. Scientist discoverd that the face was formed by a shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Over the past years scientist believe it would attract more attention to Mars. It certainly did! The famous face on mars became a pop icon all over the world. It stared in many things like hollywood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows as well.

After the big news that the face was a success scientist soon found out that other scientist believe it was an alien artiract. Jim Garvin explained that they felt this was important to taxpayers. He also photographed the face as soon as he could get a good shot at it.

On april 5, 1998 a group of

Mars Global Surveyor flew to mars and took ten more photos, That were sharper then what the Viking 1 took. Thousands of people have been waiting for the images to be posted on the website JPL. Soon after the photos were taken Mars global Surveyor have posted the images there wern't actually alien monument after all.

Many people wern't satisfied with the information that has came back to them including Garvin. Garvin stills believe that the faces that were found were yet to be alien artifacts. Garvin wants them to retake the pictures and do the research again. The Mars Global Surveyor does it agian and they retake the pictures more clearly. Scientist has come to an conclusion the the faces that were found on Mars is not yet found.",0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hi my name is Luke and there are a ton of reasons to go on Seagong Cowboys Program, and there all right here. Just keep reading and the only thing that you would want to do is go on that trip.

Oh how much fun that was on that boat with all of the lovely animals and my friends.

One of the best things about the trip was all the friends I made, you know playing games and stuff.

I know what you're thinking; what about all of that hard work the whole time.

Well on the way back the only thing that we did was play games, read, and everyonce in a while we would have to clean off the docks.

There were no animals on the way back and thats why it was so fun.

On the way there it was pretty hard work taking care of the animals, but we only had to that every hour, and even then we all pitched in and helped.

If you're thinking about how long it took, it really just depends on how fast you work.

There in't really much to say about the work that hasnt been said, the point is it's not that hard.

The best part about the trip was all the places that we stopped at along the way.

One of the best ones was when we stopped at Greece and I saw the Acropolis.

We also stopped at Vince Italy, the city had streets of water.

We also visited Europe and China, plus im even including the fact we helped so many people along the way.

This is the best thing that could have happened to a small town boy like me.

The only reason why I got to go on this amazong trip was because of one of my friends told me about it.

I guess I'm just trying to be a good friend to and give you the life changing trip.

Just think about it.

All that I'm really trying to say is that this is the most amazing that happened to me and it all I had to do was take care of a couple of animals with my some of my closest friends.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,0,0
"The development of driverless cars can be good or bad. Depending on the situation driverless cars can go ether way. If you want to stay in the past and drive your car to the full extent, go ahead. If you want to be in the new age of technology, keep reading.

Driverless cars will help the economy increadibly. They will cut the public transportation costs in half! The cars are not fully functional by them selfs so far, they need the help of a driver to navagate through complicated traffic conditions. These cars will take over the wheel when you do not want to drive.

Some say that the driver would get bored waiting for ""their turn to drive"". Also others say it would not be fun sitting watching the car drive. But what they do not know is the developers have allready looked into that problem. The answer is a digital display windsheild, you can watch a movie on your window. You can call or text from your car as it is driving. So when it is your turn to drive the display would turn off and it would tell you that you have to take over.

The technology for this to happen is here, all the developers need is your help to see if the people would want them. Imagin not having to worry about crashes, speeping drivers, drunk drivers, or taking the wrong way home. This car will eliminate thoes senarios. Less speeding tickets you have to pay, less insurance, and less money to spend on gas.

These cars will be great for the world. You will love one, just imagin thoes long road trips that you will not have to drive. Maybe you have paperwork due that day on you way to school, or work, you can do it beacuse your car is driving. The development of these cars will be amazing. This is why you, yes you shoud support the development of these cars.",3,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is fantastic because you get to do a lot of things. This is a once and a lifetime opportunity. Trust me you'll want to join just like my friend Luke didn't only like it he loved it.

First you get to see the world when you go travel on the boat ride home and back but, you don't have to go sit around and watch from the boat. When you get off the boat you have a reward. If you like to see stuff like Europe, Italy, China, Greece then you'll love it. If you don't believe me ask Luke he's the one whos been to all those places. He said that the boat trips were so unbelievable for a small town boy like him.

Also you will get to help people outside of your community. Like bring them food, water, and animals. It all ways feels good to help people in your own way. But it really effects peoples lives in the way you can help them. And it really doesn't take much to help those people.

But don't worry your not alone on this trip if you want company. You can make friends on the way like Luke did because after you give the animals to the people who need help there is room for things like Volleyball, Baseball, Table-tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling. These are all good things to pass the time after some hard work has been done.

"Would it be awesome if you could read someone's emotion by the look on their face?, You could but most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that can enable computers to identify human emotions. That means this can read emotions correctly. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can identify a person emotion by coding the facial structure is being planned to be used in classroom to read the emotional expression, In my opinion i considered it to be valuable.

First, Everyone is different and reveal different emotions. For example this technology can be used in classroom to read the emotions of students, teachers can identify when students are not paying attention or just bored. This technology will let the teachers know that maybe change plans some fun activities before moving to regain the students attention.

Second, Faces don't lie; If a student had been bullied the technology will show the emotion of that student which will alert the teachers, teachers can talk with the students about whats wrong? or what happend?. Many kids in the world are bullied but they keep their sadness and fear to themselves, even when they show sadness or fear teachers can't tell or understand. The FACS doesn't just take a picture of a face, it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model move like human muscles.

Third, This technology can have impacts everywhere not just at hospital, or video games. FACS can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Teachers can make animation and excites the students to regained attention. Teachers can do animation for the topic they are on to impress the students.

Last but not least, ""why not?"", If the FACS is affordable for schools to obtain, Why not right? It can be used for educational purposes. For example, students can use this for projects or other activites. Instead of schoolwork students can be involve with peers and read eachothers emotion. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, icluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang.

In conclusion, I considered this technology (FACS) to have a good impact in classroom, This technology can change the game for teachers and even students.",3,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear State Senator,

I think that we should change the election by popular vote for the President of the United States instead of keeping the electoral college. The reasons I think that we should have it changed to the popular vote is because I think the people should be able to choose who should be our next president instead of having the electoral college also voting for the president of the United States.

Its not only me senator, but also these important men of our country all agree with me that we need to abolish the electoral college! These men are Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerse.''The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.'' I just find all of this unfair because its not just the United states giving there opinion on who should be there next leader but some other men who have favortism for the opponets also vote too! One example of how i think the electoral college voters are unfair is back in the election of President Obama and Mr. Romney the electoral voters had 29 electoral votes for Obama and Romney only had 3. So, that election could have been more fair if we didnt have so much favortism for one person to another. When we could have had a fair vote from the people and had the opinions on who should be there next President.

Now, in the defese of the electoral college it does help situations in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast which can be very helpful when examples happen like Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 when they both had only 43 percent of the popular votes and the electoral college helped not make those elections as complicated. But, they still had a say so on who should be president and who shouldnt be president. I think that question should be answered by our own people!

Thank you so much State Senator for reading my opinion on the electoral college versus the popular vote for the President of the United States. I hope you understand where my opinion is coming from, in just saying that we need our citizens voting for who there next leader should be and not just the electoral college putting in there favortised vote!

He would probibaly also include that when they were done transporting the animals they got to go sight seeing and he would tell the person he ws trying to convince to join the Seagoing Cowboys that he got to go to/see Europe and China, he got to see Acropolis in Greece, he also would say he got to take a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, with streets of water, and he also got to tour an excacated castle in Crete.

"Have you ever looked at someone and thought, I wish I knew how they feel? Well now with the help of a new technology called Facial Action Coding System you can do just that. An article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes in depth about how the system works and what it does for society. Basically, this system shows you exactly what a face is feeling emotionally. I think this is a great idea and a step into the technology of the future.

One reason why this system is great is it can show you exactly what emotions someone has. The system constructs a 3-D model of the face on the computer. It then compares the face to a face that is showing no emotion. The system then looks at your 44 muscles in your face to see how you are feeling. The system can even detect mixed emotions. Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois is the creator of this system and he says this about the system, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" Dr. Huang is explaining that this system can even detect if you are feeling multiple emotions by weighing different units.

Another thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is recognize faces from paintings. The most recent piece of art they have studied for emotions was the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. After the process, they discovered that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Gettng these results can now tell us what painters from a long time ago were thinking about in there art when they painted it. This can be very useful in figuring out more ideas from artists in the rennisance age.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a great tool that can help out the future of emotions greatly. It can detect all emotions and even detect if someon had mixed emotions. It can also detect emotions in paintings like the Mona Lisa. I think this is a good idea and that it should be spread to the entire world.",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,3
"The 'face on Mars"" is not an alien created thing but an landform. The way that we can back this up because is they took a second photo and it was clear and you can see that it was just a landform. People said that the photo was cloudy so then they went out again in 2001 and the pixels are much better. They went out again and it was not cloudy either. It was clear that the photo was a landform. The last reason is that people from NSA can back up that the face is actually a landform. Gravan said ""that it reminds me of most Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". He also said "" that's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same size of the face on Mars"", so don't believe everything random thing a person says who doesn't even know the facts. The ""Face on Mars isn't a alien or an alien created thing, but a landform that is on Mars.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The face is just a rock formation that looks like a face due to the shadows which gives it eyes, nose and a mouth. the formation is normal and it is located in cydonia and it reminds alot of people of a mesa.

When this face first appeared on there monitors, they were surprised, but allitle bit after that they decided that it was just another mesa, which was common in the place that they found it at, which would be in Cydonia. they said that it just had unusual shadows that gave it the looks of a persons face.

They knew that it was just a martian mese, so they decided to let everyone else see this amazng picture, hoping that they could gather the attention of the public. it did do that which was great but then they wanted to know more. so then when NASA launched another mission for mars they decided to take another picture of the face, which this time it was alot clearer for the people to see that it was just another martian mesa.

People still weren't happy with those pictures, the people didn't know how hard it is to get it in the right place for another picture, but NASA was willing to get another picture for the people to finally prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. they took the picture with the camera's maximum resolution, so that the people could see everything in the picture clearly. although some people might not be satisfied, many people are.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear State Senator,

MONTH_DAY_YEAR

In this essay I will be explaining why the Electoral College shouldn't be kept,and why we should do a popular vote instead to determine the president of the United States.

In my opinion we should do a popular vote because we U.S. citizens know what we want. The Electoral College may know what they want for themselves as a unit but honestly I think that the United States should stick to a popular vote. In an article I read called ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer it states that state legislatures can technically be picking electors that will always defy the will of the people. I notice this to be very unfair because if electors are always going to defy what we say and want why should we vote. Isn't one of America's #1 catch phrases ""

power to the people

"" well in this case it seems to be ""

power to the Electoral Collage

"". In this article it also states that in many cases  ""

faithless

"" electors have ocassionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please! So if the electors can choose for whomever they please why can't we. I also think that the Electoral College is unfair because of the winner-take-all system. Candidates don't have to spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning in. While they go to the states that they know they have a absolute chance of winning in and take those winning votes. So in this case I have to agree with Bob Dole: Abolish the Electoral College!

I also think its wrong that voters can't always control who their voting for because we all the freedom to our own opinions and in the process of the Electoral Collage they are basically just throwing all opinions in the trash. They obviously don't care and I see this as completely irrational and unfair. I know that may use the Elecotoral Collage as a way to keep everyone calm but I think if they were to let the people vote they wouldn't have to be worried about us not being calm because that's us getting what we want and therefore why are we going to complain. I also consider the Electoral Collage electors high class. So in this case they are going to want to vote for the benefit of them, I think this is unfair to the lower-income families because if the electors choose a president that is going to want to take all the benefits away from lower-income families how are they going to live? How are they going to survive.""Remember ""

"i believe that smart cars, or driverless cars, are a thing of the future. only the future.

"As technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. According to Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom.

Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. Without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.",3,4,3,3,2,3,3,3,3
"Mistaken for a star, the planet, Venus is the second planet from our sun and nearly Earth's twin sister. Look more closely, it has proven to be a very challenging place to study closely. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because It is Earth's twin, life used to be on it, and it is making scientist curious and wanting to get on Venus.

It is said that the planet, Venus, is Earth's twin. Venus is the closest planet to Earth by denisty and size, it is occasionally the closest in distance too. The close planets, Venus, Earth, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds. Earth is sometimes closer to Mars and sometimes closer to Venus. The Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eripting volcaneos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes just like Earth has.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creaters. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to stufy Venus. Their possible solution to the hostole conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Our jet airplanes would travel at a higher altitude to fly over many stroms. 30-plus miles above the surface, the tempertures would still be really hot at around 170 degrees, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Eath. Radiation would not exceed Earth levels and Solar power would be plentiful. These are not easy condititons for a human but survivable.

Humans have sent countless spacecrafts to land on Venus, which none of them survived the landing for more than a few hours. No humans were ever aboard. Venus's has a thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets and there are clouds od highly corrosive sulfuri acid in the atmostphere. Venus has the hottest furface tempture of any planet in our solar system.

Dispite the dangers Earth's twin brings, Venus is still worth Exploring and having a chance to be explored. This planet has a lot of challenges but NASA is already finding a way past them, making it to where humanity still has a chance.",2,2,3,2,0,1,1,1,0
"The thought of having a driverless car appeals to many people for many reason. Some would feel like they could do other things such as talking on the phone would become safer with this. Others could feel like it would be a step closer to possibly having a floating, driverless car. With all this, people have to ask themselves, what could be the negative effecrs of having a driverless car? Diverless cars

should not be delevoped, because there are still many unknown answers.

There have been many advancments on car safty since automakers used speed sensors in the wheels when they created antilock brakes in the 1980s. Now adays you can buy a car that can detect when you are going to back into something that you can't see or came out of nowhere. With the driverless car, you have to worry about something malfuntioning while you're in the middle of traffic or if the car stopped working altogether. In paragraph 9, the author says ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufactures?"" This is something that many people will debate about. Some will say that it was the manufacturer because they didn't check car to see if it had any faults. While others will say that it was the driver because they ""behind the wheel"", but whose fault would it really be?

Many teenagers look forward to being able to drive. They may study for long hours and practice parallel parking so they can pass their drivers test, and the long a waited drivers license. Would the develpment of driverless cars take away the need for having your licence altogether? People would assume that anyone could have one because they wouldn't driving.

Even with this, people would more then likely need to be tested on how to operate a driverless car and be trained to be able to look for signs that the the car has a technical problem that needs to be fixed right away.

With every new discovery and advancement, there are many questions that still ned to be answered. Driverless cars should not be develped because there are still some important answers that still need to be looked into.

This is one of the challeneges we have to face in order to live on this planet and make this a better planet to live on and make one of the greatest achievements humans have done in a long time.

Planet Venus is one of the planets that could open the door to curiousity and new exploration. Venus is giving us new ideas by giving us a challenge to just even step a foot on it. The author states "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". That is one of the many ideas we have came up with just by thinking of getting close to venus and trying to explore it indepthly.

This planet is one of which that closely resembles earth in the most important ways that scientists have ever seen. The planet has the most important features on its surface that closely resembles earth and it is like looking in a more acidic mirror. The author claims that "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those of earth"". This shows that Venus once had the features that earth did but a long time ago. Venus had many thing that closely resembles earth but something happened and now its kinda like a wasteland.

This planet had many features that could call it a twin ton earth but something happen and I don't know but it could be the next earth humans live on. This planet still has many things that we can explore but can't at this time period. Venus could also open new things to have been made towards this travel of this planet. This planet could show a lot of things in time. Only time could tell when we would able to step foot on this planet at least once.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Many researchers wants to kmow more about Venus ans starting to created a machine that can contribute the knowledge of venus planet. A venus planet is closely to the another planet calles sun. The difference between venus and sun is the sun has fifferent speeds. Somethimes we might be closer to the Mars and other times ti venus. It's challenging planet for humans to study because it is complecated.

venus has the hottet surface tempertures of any planet on our sytem. Because of high pressure of heat it can create powerful earthquakes, and such as vocalnoes. This planet includes physical featurs such as valleys, mountains, rocky sediment and carters.

The temperatures are extremely high, the temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospher pressure ais 90 times greater than what humans has experience on earth, but the air pressure would be close to sea level on earth. just like our planet venus could have various forms of life . Sometimes venus can be nearest planetary to visit but will take a traveler a long times.

Studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents becuase",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, for some people, cars are a way of life. Nothing pleases them more than the feeling of a stering wheel on their hands, or the growl of a healthy engine. Those people probably could never live without their cars, but you probably can. Well, maybe not living without cars entirely, but at least reducing your use of them. It'll be a lot safer for the environment, and it'll cause a lot less traffic jams. So let's see why you can go a few more days without your prized Hoda Civic.

Now, you've probably had this fact jammed down your throat more times than you care to count, but, cars produce a lot of gas, which isn't really easy on the environment.  According to the New York Times article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50  percent in  some car-intensive areas in the United States."" And according to the Chicago Tribune article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter."" So, less car usage means less greenhouse emissions. Yes, there are cars out there that are more ""fuel-efficient,"" but they still require lots of energy from the environment. Not only that, but using your car less often will mean that you won't have to deal with one of the biggest evils in the world.........traffic.

Now, think, when have you ever been stuck in traffic and actually enjoyed it? Now, if you were to ride a bicycle or take a subway, you wouldn't have to deal with that! Already, some cities around the world are finding alternative ways to avoid those jams. ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" by Andrew Selsky, tells of how the capital of Colombia is doing so. ""It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths...Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaraunts and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" This means you'll be able to get to work or to that first date a lot quicker! Sure, people using less cars would strike a big blow in the automobile industry, but you don't neccesarily have to never drive a car again! What about on those long road trips, or when you have to carry a lot of passengers with you? A car would come in handy in such scenarios, but not neccesarily every scenario.

In summary, driving less would be more efficient because it means cleaner air and less highway congestion. So, after reading all of this information, do you think that you have what it takes to get from point A to point B without having to get into a driver's seat? can you take your hand off of the steering wheel long enough to open yourself up to other transportation options? Go ahead, try.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,3
"I agree because, people who get bullyed don't have to hide their emotions but the process is beginning when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the modeal must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". to make it it will take quite a bit to just make it but Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disguist, fear, and sadness. putting it together will help everyone one in the Gary district and every other city or state.In fact, human perform this same emotion everyday the no emotion or the let down emotion .

the students might feel about the situation but young adults and children can learn how to speek out.Just trying do a emotion communication.

"Have you ever heard of Seagoing Cowboys? Well a i'm a Seagoing Cowboy, I help out people that have fell in the ruins. I have shiped a lot of horses, young cows, and mules over the Alantic and sometimes the Pacific. We ship the animals over the sea to help a lot of people. You should join the UNRRA to help other people out, to change their lives.

We think all cowboys should join the UNRRA so we could make people have a better life then be poor. When you help people out you feel extrodinary. Some people say once you help some out you make you day.

I have been to across the Atlantic ocean 16 times and i have been across Pacific once. I still want to go but I have cracked ribs from an accident but it is worth helping others. I feel so great on helping other.

It is a one in a lifetime expireience it takes a month to get to China. It might take a while but it is like you never left because you still feed the cows and horses. The plus to this is you to explore preety places in China and Europe. You get to expirence something you probably have never expirenced before.

These are some reasons why to be a Seagoing Cowboy. I belive that you have a great time. Dont mis this chance because if you do you wont expirence any thing that i did. Helping other people out is something everybody should do for a iving. Helping at least someone could make a hugmungas change.",2,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,1
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom, is valuable. I believe this technology would be great to use in a classroom. It would really help the teacher with his or her lesson. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a simple classroom computer can determine a students' emotions, that would be a great assistance to a teacher. The teacher would then know if he should go into greater detail or if he should make his lesson plan a little more interesting.

Human Beings can be really good at hiding their emotions. With the Facial Action Coding System no one would be able to hide their true emotions. If someone was really depressed, but they portray themselves to be happy, this technology could stop that person from hurting themselves or others. If a school therapist or school social worker had this technology it would make their jobs so much easier. They could sense what the students are really feeling, rather than what the students want them to think their feeling. Also, the school therapist would know if the patient would need to be prescribed any medicine.

Another reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea is because, as stated in the article, it could reveal so much about the science of emotions. The FACS (Factial Action Coding System) could detect a false smile. If you are not feeling geniunely happy, if you are just ""putting on a happy face"" this technolgy would be able to see through what your false act. This new technology could become the next big thing. It would be able to uncover the truth about alot of people.

The last argument I am going to state on why the FACS would be valuable on detecting students emotions is that the technology could tell whether a student is telling the truth or not. The article states in paragraph 8 that usually when someone squint their eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of their eyes usually means that their not being thruthful. FACS uses muscle clues to determine whether a person if being truthful or not. This would be great in a classroom. For example, if someone is being bullied and they tell the teacher but the bully says he isn't bullying anyone, this would be great for the teacher. The teacher would know which one of her students is telling the truth.

In Conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would be a superb idea. This new technology would not only be very interesting but it would also save many lives. This technology could be used in many different jobs. It could also help many people. With this technology you would no longer have to take someones word on how their feeling, even when you have a gut feeling telling you otherwise. Rather than assuming what someone is feeling you could now know for sure with the Facial Action Coding System.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Dear State Senator,

I would like it if you would just keep the Electoral college because it would be so much easier to pick a president then if we the people had to pick the president. If we screw up and pick the wrong president then its our fault, but if you all pick the president it'll be your fault if the president turns out to be good or not. Besides the founding fathers founded the Electoral college so we should keep it just for their sake. Anyway the Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors which then when there picked they decide who is the new or repeating President of the United States of America. The reasons I would like to see the Electoral college do good is because the first reason as to why you should just keep the Electoral college is because everyone will want to be president heres an example .The Electoral college requires a presidential canidate to have transregional appeal. If you have a solid regional favorite you go for them states first then you work around to different states to get more Electoral votes but then if you leave that state that was with you all the way then they atomatically switch to the other person that has been campaigning around all the other states and takes your states what are you supposed to do then? The only thing you can do is just go back and try to get your state back..

"I think that the Face is just a natural landform. Just like landforms form on Earth, landforms can form on Mars. Why I say it's just a landform is because, it's just a huge rock formation,it isn't an alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object shown in the picture.

First,the Face is just a huge rock formation. Mars is a rocky planet. Rocks can form any shape they aren't created by humans. There isn't any sign of life on mars so no one could go there and make a face on Mars' surface.

Second, it isn't an alien monument. An alien wouldn't make a human face just for fun. In plus, they wouldn't even know what humans looked like. They wouldn't even know how to get to earth to see what we even look like. So trust me aliens are not real!

Third, Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object showing in the picture. This could prove that there isn't anyone or anything on mars that could've made the face. This could prove almost anything in any picture of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. It's just a huge rock formation, it isn't a alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object in the picture showing.",2,4,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"We as humans need to get in the habit of not useing car as much us we do. There are many advabtages of limiting car usage because are future is our hand. Study show that car are big part of the green house affect. There are many countrys that are trying to stop the use are automobiles . There are citys ,and towns around the world that have rules that stop you from useing your automobiles many people like it.

Country around the world are trying to stop the use of automobies like paris after a day near-record pollution,pairs enforced a partial driving  ban to clear the air of the global city. People that did not leave their cars at home they were fined 22-euro the advantages of limiting car use is that you dont get stuck in traffic , it better for the erath that u live in , and you can save money. In a german suburn it is forbidden to use a automobiles as a result, 70 percent of the familys dont have cars,57percent sold there cars to move there. The people that live in these suburb say that ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way"". MOre and more citys and towns are starting to do the same.

"Driverless cars seem to be something that is soon to become a reality in the near future, but are they safe? Companies like Google, Toyota, GM, and BMW list all these pros like; flexible transportation systems, less fuel usage, more safety features, and overall the car being a better driver than the driver. But is all the money that this project would need really worth it? There would have to be new laws and regulations, problems between the driver and manufacturer, and issues regarding our safety; as a pedestrian and driver.

Let's start with the pro of flexible transportaion systems. First off, this would put thousands of taxi and bus drivers out of a job. And with the economy being how it is, that would not be pretty. Also, some of these cars still rely on the passenger to back up into a driveway or a parking space. If the passenger can't drive, or is impaired in some way, how is this more flexible for everyone. Thousands lose their jobs for some robot that can't even do their job to the full extent.

Car companies boast that there are more safety features on these cars. Such as; vibrating seats when there's danger, heads up display on the windshield, more advanced sensors, and flashing alerts. But why put all of this money towards a driverless car, that's not even fully driverless, when we can add them to the cars that we take tests to drive, and that some assume are safer when we drive ourselves.

Which brings me to my next point. Money. The United States are already in trillions of dollars in debt. Do we really need to put all of our money towards driverless cars that we don't even need? Sure, the disabled or elderly could use this very well, but not when the cars are not one hundred percent safe, or one hundred percent driverless. There's no point in wasting money on something that we aren't completely certain are going to work. It's a waste of time, money, and will put thousands out of a job.

Manufacturers argue that, ""These cars will have better response to situations than humans."" How can they say that when they don't even know if the technology is reliable? There will be malfunctions that we as humans have no control over. I don't know about you, but if I was going to get in a car, I wouldn't trust a car, that isn't completely reliable, with my life. Safety comes first.

Lastly, laws and regulations. We have spent decades trying to perfect traffic laws and other regulations to keep our roads safe, but with these new ""driverless cars"", what happens those? If the technology malfunctions, is it the buyer's fault or the manufacturer. This will cause many problems involving lawsuits and maybe even lives being lost. We would have to revamp almost are entire system of traffic laws, and even then we would have to make another set of laws that appeal to these new driverless cars. Is it worth it?

Driverless cars. While they may have quite a few pros that make us think of futuristic sci-fi movies, are they worth what they cost? And not just in money. Jobs, time, maybe even lives? It appears that these cars are coming to us in the future, but are they really the future?",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,3
"Children are full of emotions, and therefore are confused alot. So it comes as no suprise why some children struggle in school. It is apparent that what schools are doing now isn't helping these children. All teachers are different, they have different points of view, different styles on thow they teach. These opposing views make all teachers different and could confuse their students. With a computer however, there could be meximum proformance. The children would learn better and more than they were before. Computers that read emotions could benifit schools and the nation.

Computers reading emotions could be a huge step in the right direction. Children could easily learn what is going on and if they do not the computer can evaluate that and change what it is doing. Dr. Haung explains ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"". The computer knows alot of different facial expressions and therefore can easily and quickly evaluate what the child's problem is, and fix it. The computer knows the students emotions and could easily diagnose problems and help the child to better understand what they are doing.

The computer could also learn to take disiplenry action to the child. Which if the child has violent tendencies could lead to some major conflict. If the child knows that the ocmputer is expensive he/she is less liekly to hit it. The computer may even be able to stop a bad situations before it even begins by anylising the situation by reading emotion. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness"". Anger is one of the emotions the computer can detect and could rush into a situaltion(granted it have some way of getting around) and fix or mediate the problem with facts. For diciplenry action computers would bring grat dicipline to the classroom.

Teachers in the future could be more like operators, if something happens to the computer the teachers could work on or fix the computer. Over time this could lead to the teaching industry dissappearing. Children may not think this is good and there would definently be a lack of emotion from the ""teacher"" in the classroom seeing as it is a computer. But there is too much advantage obver disavantage. All in all teachers would still have jobs but wouldnt be as active. Which would put less stress on teachers, which in turn, would maximise proficiency.

Emotion reading computers would not only benifit schools but the nation as a whole. Computers could read the emotions of each individual child and see chat works and what dosen't. The computers can also mediate arguments and take diciplenry action when needed. And teachers would have a much easier job at managing and teaching the students. Schools around the world need this new state of the art computer system to help read emotions and prepare children for the brightest future.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Keeping or changing the Electoral College would be something to carefully process out. Since the Electoral College is ""regarded on a non-democratic method of selecting a president that to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner""(10), then there should be a change made towards it. If there is ever a presidential election then there should be a fast process to organize each votings. As Americans have the freedom to choose, there shouldn't have to be a problem going on. To keep any confusion from starting, whoever's encharge of declaring each voting method has to keep the rights of each voter. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a politicial preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (23).

Making decisions can't be easy most of the time. People have to cautiously think about which will best benefit. Everyone goes through that stage when they are stuck on  a decision. It's normal. We all know that the most powerful people are stumped on any decision too. Freedom of speech, freedom of mind. Sometimes, each state will have different opinions on voting; everyone is different. What people have to remember is that America is a land of freedom and that they have to choose wisely on certain things or else the country will go downhill fast.

""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational""(14). It's not allowing the voters to actually ""listen"" to what each candidate is saying. People should have the right to vote based of what they think. It's almost like the feeling where someone is forcing somebody to do somthing that they don't want to do. As if they have no other choice. It will be best if the decision-makers start thinking about other people's thoughts. Not everything is based off of one certain process. The Electoral College sounds like it lacks the unison of people's rights that every voter will need. Certain people have to start thinking about changing certain things.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that, studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Some of the reasons the author staes that venus is dangerous is because, the clouds have a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, the surface's temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit while the, atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Adding onto that there are, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freuqent lightning strikes. Venus is actualkly a lot like Earth with its, volcanoes, density and size.

Despite The planet's dangers, Venus is a very interesting planet with many things that astronomers are astonishes by. They believe long ago, that venus was like earth by a lot. They also believe that venus was covered with oceans and could have supported tons of forms of life just like planet, Earth. Even today,Venus has feature that are very similiar to Earth's. One of the biggest reasons for wanting to find out more about Venus in a serious note is for a planetary visit, if the time were to ever come. A lot of scientists and astronomers are very intrigued into the idea of exploring Venus even more. NASA has one idea for sending humans to study venus. They want to scientists float above the surface of Venus in some sort of blimp-like vehicle.

I believe that we should explore venus, i would love to know more about Venus. It's always fun learning about things that you never knew, which a lot of people like the astronomers and scientists. I think that exploring and studying Venus is very dangeous consdering the surface tempersature and the risky weather. I think that NASA would have their best astronauts be prepared and safe at all times. We dont know all the possibilties of what could happen while a visit at Venus, but if we ever do get to explore Venus we should be prepared with the best technology. I don't know if studying Venus is the most important thing scientists and astronomers are worried about, but at one point it would be great if they took it to another level. I think the autho explained why studying Venus is so important and why it is dangerous also.",1,3,3,2,0,0,1,1,0
"A Cowboy Who Rides The Waves!

______________________________

There are many reasons that you should consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program. It is a very fun activity to participate in. In this essay I will be stating a few reasons on why I believe that you should consider participating in this program.

One reason is because you will mostly be on a boat at all times during this program. While you are on this boat you will be traveling all across the world. We all know that there are not many things to do on a boat but on these boats there most definitly be things to do. Such as sight seeing, Touristing, and much more!

Another reasosn is because say you like to get out of the house, well this will be one great oppourtunity for you to do so. Reason being because you will probably be gone for a long period of time on each trip. Plus it will take even more time because you are on a boat, and those things arent very fast. So if you are one of those people who do like to get out of the house for a long time this will be your chance to do so.

My third and final reason is because you will jus have a fun time. Mostly because there will be tons and tons of things to do on these Fun adventures. A couple of things that you might consider doing is if you are docked in paris for a few go check out the ifal tower, Or if you are docked in Washigton D.C. why not go see the White House and maybe you could even have the chance to meet the president himself.

In conclusion there many reasons you should consider taking on the Challenge of being a Seagoing Cowboy. One reason is because you will be able to see things like never before. Another is because you will be out of the house for a long period of time on each of these Adventures. Last but not least is because you will simpily just have fun.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Is it crazy that now there is a Facial Action Coding System that can identify human emotion in the world? Having a human emotion detected technology system is a bold positive choice in a classroom. A strong device that can read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, teachers can get feed back on their students about certain assignments, peers can understand one another easier, and overall a better environment as a school. One device easily has three reasons why it would be a great investment for students and teachers.

Reason one, The Facial Action Coding System is positive for a classroom because, teachers can get feed back about certain assignments based off students emotions that the system detects. In the text Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, (par 6)"".

This been said, the evidence above is reactions you can get out of students and in the long run prevent. Not only does the system help the teachers by detecting these emotions, FACS will aslo benefit the students because the assignment or classroom function will most likely change due to the results.

Reason two, The Facial Action Coding System comes to benefit within peers themselves. The author states that "" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (par 3)"". Getting assignments changed because boredom is a good thing; but, would it be a plus that peers know what one another also think in the classroom too? Muscular action units can easily change the way students look at one another in the classroom.

Reason three, The Facial Action Coding System can cause an overall significantly better open environment of many classrooms and even the whole school.

Also, Dr. Huang has noted that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication (par 6)"". The notes above by Dr. Huang proove that not many people such as students to student or student to teacher share what they are thinking or feeling verbally. Would it be so bad for students and teachers to connect overall in the school and each and every classroom?

To gradually sum everything up, The Facial Action Coding System is an immensse benefit to students and teachers in the classroom. Technology that can read emotional expressions of students is valuable because, teachers can build feed back on their students about what is going on in the class, peers can understand one another easier through six basic emotions, and overall a better environment as a school can be promised. Mkaing faces and finding a device that can detect emotion can not only chnage things but open doors for science.

In conclusion, as the text states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them (par 9)."" This evidence above is the exact reason why FACS would be a outstanding investment for classrooms all over.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Most people might not know what Seagoing Cowboys are, but that dosen't mean that you hate it just because of it's name. You should at least participate seagoing cowboys once.

People might not have many reasons to support there statement about ""Why you shouldn't be a Seagoing Cowboy'', but I have at least some reasons as why you should join the program.

One of my many reasons is if you love working with animals then your up for the job. Many of the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" had to take care of the Horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. On pharagraph two it states ""UNRRA hired ''Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that weree shippes overseas.""

If you were to join the cowboys you will have to be able to go away from your family for a while. For example, on paragraph three it states ""In Augest 1945"", and on paragraph four it states ""By the time he was discharged in 1947"", what I'am trying to do is prove my point. Since you have to be away from your family, you won't be able to see your family in about three years. If you can go three years without seeing your familly then you have forund your job.

Besides helping people, you are able to see awsome sighting and go to places that you've never been before. You are able to go and see Europe, China, the Acropolis in Greece, Crete, Panama, and you could go to Italy. On paragragh five it states "" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing Acropolis in Greece was special,"" he says ""So was taking a gondola ride in Vencie, Italy, a city with streets of water.""

Luke also toured an excaveted castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his was to China.

So, in conclusion I belive that you can, and should join the Sesagoing Cowboys. Only if you are able to parcipitate very well, and if you won't have a problem with all of those things you have to do.",2,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Since the planet Venus is the closest planet to earth's density and size scientist have been trying to explore the posibilites Venus could have. Venus is the second planet from the sun which means it is very hot. Venus is 800 degrees fahrenheit and is 90 times hotter than what we experience of earth. Humans have sent many spacecrafts to Venus, but none have sucessfully made it, the ones that have landed didnt make it longer than a few hours. A spacecraft hasnt touched Venus in more than 3 decades. Venus has an atmoshere of 97 percent carbon dioxcide.

Scientists want to explore venus because since it is the closest planet it earth maybe at one time it had life. Venus likely had a great amountof ocean water and could of had many lifeforms. Venus would be our closest option if we visited a planet. Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.

"Imagine knowing what emotions people display, even though they are not always being truthful of their expressions. The invention that was created is called ""Facial action coding systems"" or FACS. It can read the emotional expressions of anyone. From the passage, Prof. Thomas Huang used the software to test on the Mona Lisa painting. ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" The software explained that even though the picture makes it looklike the Mona lisa is happy, she wasn't all tht truthful of her emotions displayed in the picture.

Another example was that """"The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" Observes Dr. Huang, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of an expression.'' (like not smiling broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" the evidence explained that people are often times seen as displaying an emotion. Even though they show said emotions, The scanner really tells what a person wasw feeling. Another piece of evidence from the article claimed that ""Humans can perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, sad, etc."" The quote was stating that humans can calculate if one person is sad by saying ""what's the matter?"" or if they are happy, they ask what brought them in a good mood. Dr. Huang claimed thar ""Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to display an emotion."" Even though most humans may have difficult knowing that said emotions are displaying (ex. Alexythmiacs or face blind people) they may depend on the software to help them understand what emotions are on display. Final piece of evidence stated that ""Most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication and that computers will need to understand that too. Your pc at home can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona lisa's smile."" A reason for that is that if a p[erson has a computer and has a look of discomfort, the computer will not really have the scanner to recognise what the person is feeling even if they want the computer to do so. In conclusion, The FACS can recognise anyones emotion with just a scan of the face, But it is good use to see if students will display anything when in the classroom.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
The new technology called Facial Action Coding System should should be used in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. Why? you make ask. I belive it will actually rise the students smartness and test scores. Also it would be the best for years to come! It will hepl the students more smart becasue in classroom there are kids that are to scared/embrassed to rise their hand and ask questions. So if the teacher see a student is confused and sees that kid is to sacred to rise their hand then he would rexplain what he was teaching. Then if the technology shows he or she isnt confused then he would move on. This will be so great years to come because kids wouldn´t be left behind and wouldn´t feel that they have to drop out. If they will see their selfs being something big in the futer. Then we will have more doctors and mostly likely to find new medinces for illness like cancer. We will get sincetes to help us live in this earth longer and maybe hopefully keep the earth clean. They would be smart enugh to find new ways to keep the earth clean. Not even just to help the eart but help kids prevent from doing things that will harm themselfs and others. For an exmaple if the teacher sees somoene is so mad they can try to help and talk and that could help a school shooting because sometimes all we need to someone to talk to. So in conclusen i belive the new technology called Facial Action Coding System should be in the classroom because it will help the earth and thw world but mot imporantly us humans.,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Transportation helps us get to where we need to go. One way of transportaion that most people use are cars. Cars have all changed thorughout decades. New equipment is put in a car to make them more fancy or more safe.

Technology is all around us now. How would it feel if a car controlled us? There are so many way to argue this topic about cars that control themselves. What is really the purpose of this car?

All of the cars made before the Driverless Cars were driven by a person. Although the driverless cars are not that popular yet, people are intrested in them. The more technology we use, it makes society seem more lazy. ""- but how much smarter did the cars need to be?""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). This feels like the new technology is taking over us. Soon, we will be like robots.

The driverless car has sensors and special navigation to help the driver. So why is it called a driverless car if the driver has to be alert? There will still be a driver in the drivers seat, in this case there are pros and cons. Many teenagers want to drive as fast and as soon as they can, but they are still unexperienced. This will be more helpful for the new driver, but the new driver might take advantage of the driverless car.

Drivers driving the driverless car might get the wrong idea. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over then the situation requires"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Drunk driving is a leading cause of

death. If a drunk driver has a driverless car, the peron might believe that they would get home safely because the car knows what it would be doing. If a there is a situation that occurs, and the car need attention; but doesnt get it, to whoms fault would it be? In this case I would say both. First, there is a a drunk driver, and the car should have been alert to what to do.

The purpose of this car is to help other people who can and know how to control the driverless car. A driverless car could be usefull for people that would need a ""safe"" car. I believe that we should not have a car like this. If we keep the cars how they are now, we will be okay in the future. Driving is a privlage, not a right. A

person drives and controls a car; not a car.",2,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The advantages of limiting car usage are,street parking and driveways are now. car ownership only alloowed two places to park and that  large garages at the egde of the development where the car owner can buy space. Without that you wont be able to park anywhere  you would be better off walking or riding a bicycle.

There been efforts to make cities better for walking home and to other places. some countries developed increase of numbers of private cars owned and are being used with private parking spaces. It is a huge effect of reducing greenhouse gas if theres not lots of driving 50 percent of some car intensive area are effected. they are starting car reduced communities and legislator just for cautious to limit greenhouse gas from going out.

Many experts  expect public transportation serving to play a big role in the new limiting car usuage. They made the motorist leave there cars at home or suffer a big fine. They did care even if you have a license plate or a odd number plate. They also limited car usuage because france uses diesel fuel  and that was a big impact in western europe.

A car free day was made buses or taxes were the only cars permitted. They used those to ride to work or any other alternative to reduce smog. That was the best opportunity to clear air pollution. Many people from other countries came to see and celebrate the event that was happening. So many bicycle paths were made just because there were no more car usuage that was the most in any amercican city.

Sidewalks were replaced by even better smoother sidewalks even a rush hour started to happen now that the car usuage was limited. That dramatically cut traffic for taxes and any other vehicle that was still in usage. Some people feel more connected over the internet now instead of using there car to go see them all these changes made it  hard to continue the habit of not driving.

Since the cars were out of usage a bike shaing program started and really increased the population that has been dropped because of all the cars not in use. If you were around the age sixteen and thirty nine you could get your lisence and start to drive again.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Can you imagine you not having to drive your own car? Well in the future driverless cars are coming to you. Many car brands are in on driverless cars. However, I am against driverless cars because of their many side affects. You may still want a driverless car because of the advantages but I do not want a driverless care due to it's many disadvantages.

Driverless cars are coming in the future. Most people are excited about driverless cares because they blocked out the disadvantages. Other people feel how I feel, that driverless cars are dangerous and cause many problems to whomever may get in behind a driverless car. Driverless cars have advantages to a certain exctint but I feel they are unsafe to all humans no matter how they work.

Driverless cars are expensive to make and would cause you to have to upgrade roads just so they can work which would cost millions and billions of unneeded dollars. Driverless cars are not so driverless, they still want you to take over the will as much as they neeed you to. Whenever their is an accident or something that the driverless car can't handle the human in the car has to take over and drive. This is very unsafe because humans may become unalert and unaware due to the fact that they are no longer in control of moving the vehicle they are in.

Driverless cars are unsafe because if a human were to fall alseep they are unaware to their surroundings. Humans are unaware of the fact they have to still drive in oder to be safe and not cause damage to anything around them. A human has to pull in and out of the drive way in the driverless car. If the driverless car is so great, how come humans still have to drive? That is one reason why we should stick to humans driving their own cars.

A driverless car the car will drive at a constant speed of 25 miles. In some cases that may be to slow. If their was an emergency the car would drive way to slow and could possibly put a humans life in danger due to the slow speed. In a driverless car, the point is to not have a human driving the car at all. In the driverless cars they still want humans to drive, humans tend to get bored and lack intrest waiting for a situation to happen.

Safety is such a big concern in driverless cares. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car as a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have led the country in allowing liminted use of semi-autonomous cars; manufacturers believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are proved more reliably safe. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--- the driver or the manufacturer?

On behalf on all humans I feel we need to stick to human driven cars. In driverless cars we would have to always worry about our safety. We would have to worry about the "" what ifs"" and all the possibilaties that could happen being in the driverless car. Many humans could be injuried or seriously hurt due to being in a driverless car. If anything were to happen in the driverless car who will the blame be put on, the person who made it or the person in

it?

In conclusion, drivers should go the safer route and drive themselves around instead of relying on a monitored car. You still have to worry about the possibilaty of something happening to you or anyone else in the car especially if you have any children. Drivers are much safer driving themselves around not having to worry about something happening to them or them putting their life in danger by entering the driverless car. Driverless cars may be cool but very unsafe until proven than can be safe and well organized all humans should stick to taking their self everywhere like we have over the last hundreds of decades.",4,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In 1976 Viking fly to Mars, and when they orbit/circle the mars they see a big head that look like pharoah head.

I think that the head was form by itself when the heat from Mars rise and it burn some of the rock and form the big head. I don't think it was made by alien because if they were in Mars they would burn when the sun come or when the heat rise from Mars. If it were made by alien then we would see their foot print or some symbol or marking that is unusual to Earth. The people who was there to take this photo said it was ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"". It said that on ""April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 time sharper then the original Viking photo"". ""There was no alien monument after all"". So, the head was created by landform and if there were alien they would have seen them or take a photo of them but there was none so it was created by landform.

In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"".",1,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"In paragraph 2 it was stated that Google cars aren't truly driverless. Also in paragraph 7 it was said that none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel. Finally in paragraph 9 it asks who would be responsible if technology fails. I'm against driverless cars.

Humans need to know how to drive a car for simple actions. In paragraph 2 it says divers sometimes need to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as roadwork or accidents.

Stated in paragraph 7 none of the cars developed so far are completly driverless and humans need to stay alert. Human need to know how to drive a car incase technology fails or an emergency. If a human doesn't know how to drive a car and relies on the car and you're in a dangerous situation, then the driver and passengers are most likely to be killed. A human needs to know how to navigate through work zones and around accidents. The Google Car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over.

Safety is the number one most important thing when being in a car. It's the drivers job to make sure everyone in the car and themself is safe. If someone is injured or technology fails, who is at fault- the driver or the manufactuer? Trafiic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times.

I'm against driverless cars because Google cars aren't truly driverless, humans need to stay alert to take over the wheel, and who would be responsible if technology fails.",1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
"No, we should not have diverless cars. One reason we should not have them because they are dangerous. Someone could die from a malfunction and they would loose their life because of the company. My next reason we should not have them because they cost too much. We are barley affording to pay teachers let alone have money to pay for reaserch and materials. My final reason is because they are just pointless. Without drivers that would put so many people out of a job.

My first reason is because they are dangerous. Anything can go wrong and end up killing innocent people. Technology has malfunctions everyday and sometimes we dont know why. No person or people should loose their lives because people are too lazy to drive their own vehicals.

My next reason is because they cost too much. Here in Richmond, Indiana we are barley affording to pay for schooling and teachers let alone driverless cars. Driverless cars should be the least of our worries at the moment. Instead of focusing on driverless cars, we should focus on how to lower the cost of an education. Education should be our number one priority.

My final reason is because they are pointless and would put many people out of a job. With driverless cars, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and many others would be out of a job. The passage says "" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" That statement proves that many jobs will be lost because people are getting too lazy and too pre occupied to drive on their own.

In conlusion i do not think that driverless cars are a good idea. Our poverty rate will go up, and children and familys will starve. Where will we get the money to pay for the reaserch? We would have to take away even more jobs just to pay for the reaserch. We should not have driverless cars because they are dangerous, they cost too much, and they will put many poeple out of a job that they actually need.",2,4,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different deisgns, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common - they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutants given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollutions so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutant emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tend to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive everyday, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutants coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want wihtout rushing becaus the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With less cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway (Source 1). With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Plaza states in the article ""Car-fre day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Heirdrun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, (Rosenthal)"" When Heirdrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some down fall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom; uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks; rush-hour will be cut traffic; and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""parternering with the telecommunications inductry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transprtation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" (Source 4). In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment.",5,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,1
"The Facial Action Coding System a new technology that helps you to understand human emotions, it can calculate the movement of the major muscles of your face, it can recognize six basic emotions, and it can make a difference beetwen a real and a fake emotion

First, The Facial Action Coding System can calculate the movement of the muscles of your face, the software has a process that begins by making a model of your face in third dimension including 44 the major muscles of your face, after associate the movement of your muscles with a face that has no emotion then it know what was the movement of every muscle from its normal position to the position that has when there is a emotion.

Second, it can recognize six basic emotions, the six basics emotion that the software can recognize is: happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. how it works? well it recognizes every muscle and analyzes the movement that every muscle makes when you have an emotion, that means that there are predeterminated movements and the software associate the movements of your face and the prederminated movements for every emotion.

Finally, it can make a difference between a real and a fake emotion, it means that the software is capable to recognize natural movements of your face and forced movements, it is a helpful characteristic because the software cannot have a mistake when it is analyzing emotions.

In Summary, the software has enough capacitiy to recognize, the movements of your face, Recognize six emotions, difference between a real and a fake expresion, it means that it just need to add more emotions and improve the analyzing of faces and the software would be helpful.",1,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0
"I think there should be no driverless cars there is really no reason for them and they put peoples lives in danger

for no reason.

There is no reason for driverless cars the purpose of the driver is to have someone to take responsability for the actions done involving the car or taken with the car if the car is driving its self the car can not take responsability for the cammands it was given. Just like anything that needs wi-fi if the car is given instructions from a computer that car could be hacked and my cause an accadent where they do not know who to hold responsable for the death of someone who chose not to get a smart car and wants to drive their car themselves. Not only do you have to worry about the cars but also the people who chose the old fashion way and chose to drive their car what if the smart car has a glitch and that glitch is all it takes to take lives. It may say that there has not been an acadent yet does not maen there can not be one at all.",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Over the past few decades, talk regarding car pollution and usefulness has become common. Several people believe that the neglegence of cars is beneficial to the world, while others hold the belief that automobiles are a necessary part of daily life. Living in a world without cars can be very beneficial on many levels. Many entities benefit as a result of the use of other forms of transportation. The explanations of the help and drawbacks of a car-free society will be examined in this essay.

Car free land helps the environment to a vast extent. In many countries, automobile emission is the leading cause of air pollution that in return can harm the environment. This form of pollution is especially eminent in densely populated cities where public transport is unavailable. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the global city,"" as found in source 2, demonstrates the already global initiatives being taken by the governments of particular nations. Many pro-car arguments will contend that factories cause more pollution than cars, but they fail to consider how many countries' economies depend on factory goods while car usage can be replaced with alternatives that are better for the prosperity of the planet.

Many new alternatives to cars have been created. From source 3, ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation."" Many forms of transportation, be it public or private should be made available to residents of nations. Metros, hybrid power buses, and monorails can be implemented in cities where pollution from smog is a problem, as they pollute in negligible amounts if at all. Private solutions can be viable for people who prefer a more calm approach to saving the world. Hybrid cars are now becoming more widespread and available for almost the same price as regular gas emission vehicles. Hybrids are powered mainly on electricity and batteries, and do not give off harmful carbon monoxide that destroys the ozone layer.

The purchasing rate of cars has already decreased. As demonstrated in source 4, ""If the pattern [of  the decrease in car purchases] persists...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment."" Here it is evident that the switch to more ""eco-friendly"" solutions to transportation are naturally and calmly happening. Ergo, the people of many states and countries have already taken the initiative to make the change, but it is also now up to the government to implement public transportation for the portion of the population that cannot afford their own form of travel. This initiative has been taken in cities like Paris, New York, San Francisco, and Moscow.

As truly mentioned in the first source, ""[People] have given up their cars."" This is the first step to a world that is pleasant to the environment all around the world, as the health of plants, animals, and even humans is dependent on the air around them. Not only is public transport becoming more and more evident in select cities, but personal electric vehicles are opportune as well. This is a new age and people should take advantage of it. Smartphones, laptops, and other technological feats are neat, but in order to be able to enjoy those luxuries, we need to be able to appreciate our Earth and treat it with respect by becoming a car-free world.",4,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3
"My belives of the ""Driveless Cars"" are very negative. First of all how

are these cars? How much money will be needed to make and buy these cars? Who will buy them? The most important question is ""What benifets do we get out of these cars?

First of just how safe are these cars? As stated in paragraph 9 ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" That means that these cars must be 100% safe for indiveduals to drive. Another thing to keep in mind is that whos are people to blame if the technology fail? In this case the we wouldn't know who is to blame in case of a jury. Court problems could be dificult to solve do to this case.

Another negative side to these Driveless Cars is that how much money will it take for these companies to make. How much money is the government going to use in a car that could fail it's dutties when the goverenment could use that money for better things like army supplies, Global Warming, or even on Chareties. All that money could be used for many good and reasonable items. That is another great point in why we cant make these unreasonable cars.

Now lets say these cars won't fale. How many people are going to be able to buy them? We cant just make a lot of driveless cars if not many people are

going to be able to afford them. Most of all they need to funktion well and be affordable. But my most important

question is what do these cars benefit to us? Are they going to bring us safe home? Will they take care of young adults while being in them alone? We have the right

to know all of these questions before they even come out.

In the end those are all my belives in why these cars are a bad idea from these manufacturer. We do not need failing technology out in our human driven roads. Our cars are fine the way they are driven by humans and not by some failing computer driven technology! It will be another reason in why humanity will end.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"From Luke's point of view participating in a Seagoing Cowboys program would be lots of fun because it said in the article it said it was a once in a lifetime expirence. Also you would have to be careful because if you have a night job and it is raining you would have to make sure you dont break anything when you go up the stairs. Also in the boat you would travel to alot of countries. There are many things you could volunteer for the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might be fun i mean you would help animals. Also you would have to be paitent because it takes awhile to get place to place. It said in the article it took two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean. You also help people with thier needs. It will maybe open your eyes alittle so you can see that you should be grateful for what you have. On board you can play baseball,volleyball,and table tennis and many more things so you won't be bored out of your misery.

So as you can see it will be a fun expierience unless you get hurt or something but other than that it surely will. Luke's claim was probalay to particapate and enjoy it. Also Luke should thank Don Reist because Don is the one who mentioned this opportunity.

"Hellow, my name is Luke Bomberger and I would like too share with you the experience I had as being a Seagoing Cowboy. Do you like helping people,visiting sites,and caring for animals? Then this might be that right job for you. When a first heard about it I was interested in becoming one of many Seagoing cowboys. As a Seagoing Cowboy you have a lot of responsibilates. One responsibilate is you will be a member of the UNRRA. You will also get to visit a lot of contries on you way there and you will get to see there land marks. Then as a Seagoing Cowboy you will also have to take care of the animal that you wil be shipping overseas to there destination.

At first it sound wierd to be called a Seagoing Cowboy but if you like site seeing and going to places you have never been before then this job is just right for you. When I went I sall the Acropolis in Greece and I also rode on a Gondola in Venice,Italy throgh the street water. If these place sound good imagen all the places you could visit if you become a Seagoing Cowboy.

In addition to going to places you have never been before you also get the chance of helping people that's homes are in ruins due to World War 2. There is and organization called the United Nation Relief and Rehabilitation Administration which is also known as (UNRRA). This organization helps contries recover animals,food suplies and more. 44 nation join together to help these contries in need. So if you want to help these contries than becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is the right jod for you.

Also if you like animal this is the right place for you to be. Me and my friend help animal by getting young cows or mules shipped overseas. One day we had to boared 355 horses and enough food to feed then all to get there. We helped by returning them to a place that they can live in that is not in ruins. In addition to visiting place you will also be able to take care of animal as you ship them overseas.

Now that you now that Seagoing Cowboys Visit marvoluse places and in addition they also help the UNRRA and help take care of them and relocate animals by shipping them overseas. I hope that however is reading this,and if you get the chance,will sign up to become a Seagoing Cowboy. I also hope that if you do become a Seaging Cowboy that you injoy your experience, I now that I sure did.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"The message coming from these four passages is that with the amount of driving it's causing what some say ""smog"". The ""smog"" is caused by the amount of cars, all the exhaust is bad for the air. In the first passage, second paragraph it states that some people gave up there cars. There's not a lot of driving and there's only two places to park, a large parking garage at the end of the development and if someone buys a space for $40,000 which comes with a home.

In the second passage ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they enforce a small ban on driving to clear the air of the city. During the couple of day that this occured 4,000 people were fined for $31 for not leaving there cars at home, along with the 27 people who had their car impounded for their reaction to the fine. After five days of no cars, the smog in the air had decreased. After about a week the smog had cleared enough for them to clear the ban.

In the third passage ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it says they went three years with only taking buses or taxis for the Day Without Cars in a city of 7 million. If people drove cars they were fined just like the people were in Paris, only in Bogota it was a $25 fine. Some people in the city of Bogota state ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"". New places have been built, old things were made new in this city, it seems to be a better place there.

In the last passage ""The End of Car Culture"" It talks about the driving and the cars in the US. Studies show that Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars, less driving, and less people are getting their licenses as the years pass by. Since 2005 the number of miles has been dropping year after year. many sociologists believe that if this type of pattern continues it will have benefits for the carbon emissions and for the enviorment around us.

As you see there are many differnt things going on around the globe that have to do with the amount of driving and how it's not entirely good for Earth. In some cities the amount of smog has decreased, some cities have become better with new buildings and things that were rebuilt. In one of the cities people enjoy the ""Car-free days"" it relieves stress in people and helps clean the air of their enviorment. There are many different ways that limiting car usage is an advantage to us. Less stress, cleaner air, and a better enviorment.",1,2,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Would you want to be able to know how your peer is feeling without even having to ask them ? It would be a great movement but would it make teenage life harder than it already is ? The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) is valuable for students in a classroom . Reason being is school is the only place students can run to too hide their feelings. If we are able to see how a student is feeeling we can help with any problems , bring classmates together, and have happeir students.

Knowing how your student is feeling as a teacher can be hard because you just cant soak into the childs brain. With the FACS nwo you can , you able to detect hwo that person is feeling . this can help a lot with when a student is feeling sick and it scared tor talk . In the article it says, ""The facila expressions for each expression are universal"", this means it can detect most comman emotion faces . Most human would likr the idea because its almost like your a mind reader with a little computer help .

The FACS would also be valuable for students in a classroom because it would bring classmates together . By know howing their peer is feeling many kids would try to figure out whats wrong with that child. They would definetly enjoy this creaction . "" For instance, you can probaly tell how a friends is feeling simply by the look on her face"". thats how most children think they are reading their freinds mind but technology has expanding it in a more valuable way . Classes are dying to have this creation as of today after reading the article.

Many other students may think that FACS is a bad idea simply because this is showing your personal feelings and some might be insecure of allowing that happen. Parents might get involved and say that they don't want their child going to a certain schools because of FACS . What the parents and some children are missing is the FACS can bring happeir students . I know this because in the article it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomign confused or bored"", and that is a very neccesary detective system . Reason being is because the shy students will never raise their hand and tell the teacher that they don't understand; being shy make it harder for the child to learn. Just being able to identify that about a child can make thier school days happier .

In conclusion to the FACS , the syemtem is very well put together and is very valuable to have in classrooms . Being able to read emotion of a person is similar to being able to read the mid of a person . Meanwhile you have your people who dissagree but, soon as they experience it they will fall in love . ""The Mona Lisa is really intened to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

, as said thats just what it will do . If we are able to see students emotion it will bring classmates together , help swith students problem and bring happeir students to school each day .",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"1976 Nasa took a photo of a landfill that looked like a human face. Later on though they discovered that the face was just a martian mesa, and that the shadows helped the mesa look like a face. It is not evidence to life on mars because , Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia, And on April 5th 1998 the surveyer took another picture of the face on mars, and the image was much more clearer and they could see that it was just a landform nothing more.

Martian mesa's are very common and can be found through out Mars. The only thing that helped it look like a face was, the shadows that the mesa made. The sun also cause the mesa to look like a face but when nasa took a closer and clearer photo of the mesa they found out it was just a simple rock formation that had very dark shadows making it to look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth as the text states.

You see al it was just a landform there was no alien sculpture or anything like that, even though that would have been cool it just didn't happen. But thats okay because we learned new things about Mars and about space. But in the end we all learned something new.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"The author best supports his idea because he states that ""Venus still has some features tha are analogous to those in Earth."" He also states that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" These are all reasons of why Venus is worth studying despite the danger which relly supports it.

I believe that the author is right that Venus is worth the studying despite the danger because despite the warm weather once we understand/study Venus all people should be use to the conditions or would be prepared.The author stated that ""Many researchers are working on innovations that wuld allow our machines to last longer in Venus."" I think now that they are studying this it would help us in understanding of how to live in those conditions.

Therefor I believe that Venus is worth the risk and believe that scientists should keep studying so in the future we can make our first visit.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"It could be valuable because by facial expressions being shown teachers could tell if the kid in the back of the class that never talks understands the content or not. Like it says in the passage ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Maybe the computer could reroute the kid to a new website where it shows the same content but may not be as boring nd confusing as the other website.

I think it would be good to put facial expression recognition on computers to see kids facial expressions. I think it could also definitely improve some of the kids grades. And alo help them lead to a good future and career all because of one program that reasd their facial expressions and it could ultimatley decrease the percent of people dropping out. And thats why i think it would be a good idea to put facial recognition on school computers.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,2,2
"Different places from all over the world have different ways of choosing a leader . In the U.S we run a anachronism ,non-democratic method of selecting a president . When choosing a president  it is a competition between Democrats and republicans . I think it is best to keep the Electoral college because it wouldnt be fair to citizens , and its a thrill for the presidents to share there thoughts for upcoming events to change the world.

The U.S is supposably a free country , everyone has a right to vote , and freedom of speech ; if congress decides to not do electoral college , then it wouldnt be fair to citizens .Reason being is that , youd be hipocrytical , saying everyone has a right but you wouldnt let citizens pick who they would like to have run for president . People , would loose trust in the U.S if they didnt get a chance to atleast vote for president , everyone would be against U.S and most likely leave . Even if the people who voted for the future president theyd like didnt win they still will be satisfied enough , because they tried  .

When future presidents go up for election they become nervous , start to sweat , start to think twice about what they wanna say ,how are they gonna propose what to say , and to think are they really gonna keep their promise ?  They wanna share so much with us ; it becomes a thrill going up for competion . To know what to say , to bring people in , to share his/hers thoughts to change the world we live in . If congress were to change that , they wouldnt get a chance to share all there ideas with us , to get to know us as a family, to what we would like to help others . Without there annoying pep talks how do we know they dont wanna ruin the world ? Yeah its annoying but its worth standing there or watching it on telivision to hear , to feel the excitement of there ideas to help the low class , to help every class not evan the low class , its everyone to help everyone in the own ways .

The reasons for keeping the electoral college are that it really wouldnt be fair to citizens , and the thrill for upcoming presidents wouldnt be able to share there wonderful thoughts to change billions of lifes .Think of all the people that will be devistated of how the U.S changed the ways we vote . Having someone to run our country is very important , if we change our ways of electing , who knows what disaster will live in next ?",2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Is the ""Face on Mars"" real or not real? Some may argue against this, but I feel that there isn't enough proof to conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is real. There are many reasons behind this statement. The original picture was taken during the cloudy Martian winter and the photography business has improved so much since then that the new image are proof that there is no face. I feel that the ""Face on Mars"" in not actually an alien-made structure because The original picture, which is what started the theory of Mars having a ""face"", was taken during the very cloudy Martian winter, the photographs taken of the ""face"" have changed a lot over time, and the newest 2001 image has basically proven the ""Face on Mars"" not to be real.

First off, the original picture of the ""Face on Mars"" was taken during the Martian winter which was very cloudy at the time. The photograph had obviously had to have been different than the actual so-called ""face"" because of this. If you were to try taking a picture when it is very foggy outside, would you be able to get a clear picture? No, you would barely be able to tell what the photograph was supposed to be of. Imagine taking that same photo from several hundred yards away. The picture would be even worse than before.

Secondly, the photograpy business has changed a lot from 1976 to 2001. One of the most well known atributes of a camera is its pixel size. The more pixels you have in a certain area, the better the photograph. The original image from 1976 had pixels that were 43 meters per pixel for the photo. 25 years later, during 2001, the new photograph taken of the ""Face on Mars"" had pixels that were nearly 30 times smaller than the original. This image's pixels were 1.56 meters per pixel.

Finally the most recent photo of the ""Face on Mars"" has basically proven the theory of the ""Face on Mars"" to be unreasonable. Afterall, the new image shows that valleys and craters in this structure. You can now tell that what was thought to be the eyes, nose, and mouth of the ""Face on Mars"" are just mere indentions on the structure. The ""Face"" really looks nothing like an actual human face. There just simply isn't enough proof in the new photograph to logically think that the ""Face"" is alien made.

As I said at the beginning of this explanation, there is still a lot that can be argued about. The fact that this structure os probably at least several thousand years old plays a huge factor in the theory. Mars's winds and stroms could have possibly worn away the details on the ""face"". Also, the valleys and craters could have come because of an earthquake or some other natural event. This is an argument that may last forever.

All in all, there is simply not enough proof to make the conclusion that the ""Face on Mars"" is alien-made. The time period has changed. The photography has changed. In fact, NASA wishes that there was enough proof to call this alien-made, but they think that there just isn't enough yet. This may truely be a mystery that will never be solved.",4,4,3,4,1,2,2,3,2
"Dear senator, I believe the Electoral College System is wrong.

In source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."". In other words, your vote is basically in the hands of someone else, and hopefully they vote for who you want what's even worse is electors are picked on at state conventions, sometimes state party's central committee, or even sometimes the presidental candidates, so you, the citizens don't get to pick the elector. Voters can not always control who their electors vote for and voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate.

Moreover, in source number 2, Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we might call the diaster factor... state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people...electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."". Furthermore, this shows how the citizens of the United States of America really don't have a direct, liberal,voting system to choose who they want to won the election because at anypoint the electors can just go against what the citizens want and vote for who they please.

Lastly, Plumer states, ""the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each states, candidates don't spend time in each state because they know they hvae no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."". Basically,this is saying that small states don't get to see campaigns or any of that because they're small states so they don't evem get a visit from the elector.

Overall, The electoral college is unfair, outdated and irrational. We should all have the right to vote for who we want directly and not have to go through electors which there is a very high chance they might change their minds and vote for the other party.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"All of you look at the face on the moon all the time but there is more than just the moon with an face on it. Well, the planet im talking about right now is Mars. Scientist believe that rocks just so happened to form an object that looks like an human face, also they do not think that the alien theory is correct. Others think that alien life on mars is possible. Im going to tell you why the scientist are correct, and why the media is incorrect.

Scientist believe that this cannot be alien artwork because they are certian it is an Mesa they say these mesa's where very common alll around Cydonia. Also this was said to be form by multiple shadows giving away illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. Fortunantly NASA got in the news, the paper, magazines, books, talk shows, and TV!

The media is incorrect becuase they aren't as able to go in a deep as the scientist can the media [people in america] can only use the resoures they as scientist has th right equipment to get the job done. Also if there was some kind of aliens they be very far we would have been able to see the aliens establishment.also there would be evidence baount movement if it was created by aliens they must've been strong to be able to haul all of those rocks. One more thing is education none os these people are just trained every day on how to use these machines it are lots and lots of hardwork and dedication. People have to go to college to get an degree on this very complicated work that is done by these specialy picked scientist.

So, in the end the scientist were scientificly right because there is lots of Mesa's around Cydonia. Also scientist got a little bit of and bebifit by being noticed in social media. The media were incorrect be cuase there was not alot of resoures the media could use unlike the scientist [or people that research at NASA] withc have all of the equipment they need to get the job done.

"I stand behind the development of driveless cars. I think they could be a great improvement to transportation and commute.

As Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions in the article, there could be a public transportation system composed of driveless taxis that I think would be greatly beneficial as transportation. They would conserve fuel, which is good for the environment, and offer more flexibility for people who need to commute. Plus, if this system is made true as a public transportation system, it might reduce spending for people who use it and normally might spend more paying for fuel for their car, and/or car maintenance. People spend a lot on making sure their cars are working fine; with driveless taxis as a mode of transportation, you wouldn't have to worry about mechanic and/or fuel costs. A driveless taxi system could be dependable enought that you wouldn't even have to learn to drive or get a car, which could save you not only the cost of a car, but also time.

Driveless cars could also reduce accidents. Currently, they're only programmed mainly to assist, and do basic driving, letting a human cut in when there are road or traffic issues and accidents. But, if one day, driveless cars were to be the main mode of transportation, and there were enough of them in circulation within an area, they could reduce accidents in that area with their smart-driving programming. Just assisting, as they mainly do now, is still a great improvement

- they're programmed to drive safely and smartly, and likely would not be the cause or part of an accident. Current traffic laws assume that the only safe cars have human drivers, but I think driveless cars could be entrusted with keeping safety standards for these reasons. After all, it's humans that cause accidents - I don't think driveless cars could be programmed to be so reckless.

Driveless cars are a great innovation. They would be useful and beneficial to so many people, and could reduce many risks that are issues with human driving today.",2,4,2,3,2,3,3,3,3
"The use of Facial Acting Coding System would not be a practical use for the students in a class room. Many people would not want a computer looking at them to see their facial expression to determine what they like or what they dislike. Many people can often pull of a fake expression that is good enough for a computer to calculate, like in paragraph seven, which includes instructions on how to do a real smile compared to a fake smile.

Most people cover up cameras on their laptops,computers, and phones for privacy and safety. Anyone who would cover up their camera would most likely not want their face constantly being scanned to tell emotion or what they like and dislike.

In paragragh seven, the article briefly explains how to look happy, which anyone can do to fool an emotion scanner. Computers are often accurate, but only do what is coded and not anything else. If you were to always be happy but not look happy, the Facial Action Coding System would not be something useful for you or students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System can have many flaws in its design and would not be useful for students in a classroom. It may be innaccurate and not scan correctly or not be used at all for safety and privacy. there are many ways that the Facial Actions Coding System would not be useful and would not help students learn, just show how they feel about some things like websutes and ads.",2,3,2,3,2,2,1,2,3
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" pulls the reader in by making them curious about what the planet has to offer. The reader would think, after reading the first one and a half paragraphs, that humans need to do further research and consider the benefits. However, the author unintentionally goes against the arguemen and proceeds to list why this should not happen.

The beginning of the article shows the parallels between Earth and Venus. In paragraph one, the author says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and ocasionally the closest in distance too."" This makes the reader believe the author makes a compelling argument. Then in the end, just like the beginning, the author circles back to a motivational and positive tone that is not necessarily seen throughout the rest of the article. This is because, in between, there are multiple paragraphs (one of the first containing information about failed spacecraft missions) full of reasons why traveling to Venus would prove dangerous and non-beneficial.

The author seems to list these reasons on and on until the reader seems to forget what the article is about. The benefits illustrated in previous paragaphs are gone and only the difficulties of traveling to Venus remain. The most prominent example is in paragraph 3, when the author states, ""[Venus's] conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" The author then goes on to explain NASA's point of view and what they are doing to get more research on Venus.

NASA, as the article says, would like to send ""scientists to float above the fray."" Although the conditions are not as favorable, they seem to be the best option, however, the author tells the reader that there are more difficulties. They explain that the state of the planet makes it hard to see what is actually on the surface. This contradicts the little hope the reader may have that NASA can explore Venus well. Besides the many other ways they are trying to.

After the author lists the final few reasons why exploring Venus is still a viable option, and explaining new and old technological options, they seem to redeem themselves. By the end of the article, the reader gains a sort of fear of traveling to Venus. Instead of the author listing the benefits, like they appeared to want to do in the beginning, the challenges are unveiled, thus explaining why the article is titled, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" and just why it may not, in fact, be a great idea after all.",4,3,3,3,2,3,2,3,3
"It is reasonable that the mask shown up on Mars' surface is not an alien. In order for a creature to live somewhere it has to be the right environment. As the artice ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" said the creature or ""alien mask "" was very large. Planet Mars is not nearly big enough to have creatures with the head size of a whole mile to fit. Just think your body is much more bigger than your head. A head that steratches two miles ear to ear in a very large head, just imagine how large the body would be!

Over time land can begin to crak or break. Something could have been going on inside Mars' crust ,for instece here on Earth we have earthquakes, that could have happened on Mars.

to apperar on Mars' surface is normal as it was stated in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

"Dear State Senator,

I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions. But, from my recent discovery it might not be as well thought out and fair as we thought.

I was just informed that i'm not really voting for the president, i am voting for the official voter that will then, in turn vote for the president(Using their own biases). Since i was not aware of this, i am quite shocked. I'm assuming that this is just something that gets passed by or not looked at very deeply, but i willbe that person that digs down and gets all up in the business of somone other than myself.

This is offical: The electoral colllege is unfair, oudated and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without a basis in reality.

"Dear, Florida Senator

I believe that we should get rid of  the electoral college system because it has so many flaws. The electoral college has robbed prsidental canidates like (Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob dole, & Al Gore) of their chance of becoming president, even after they won the popular vote, but their not the only ones who wants a change to the way we elect our presidents, recent studies show that over 60 percent of voters would like a change to the way we elect our president.

The second thing that is wrong with the electoral college is that your not voting for the president your voting for the electors who pledged to that person. Also people from larger states are complaining about what happens with a tie because if their is a tie the house of representives decide,but the thing that is crazy is that 1) representative from Wyoming would have a much say a the 55) representatives from California.

The third and final thing that is wrong with the electoral college is that the electoral college is unfair to the voters, because the winner take all system canidates don't spend a lot of time in states they know they will not win. Canidates will only focus on the areas that they know or have a strong chance of winning. Like the year 2000 campaign seventeen states did not see the Canidates such like Rhode Island, & South Carolina, so how do they think they feel not knowing the person running this country?

I strongly feel like you guys should really consider a change to the way we select our president.

"The face of Mars is a landform in the region of Mars called Cydonia. Because of limited photographic resolution at the time, the Viking 1 photo from 1976 makes it look like a face. Some people say that the face was made by aliens, but there is scientific evidence against this.

The reason it looks like a face is because the 1976 photograph was blurred. A later photo taken in 1998 makes it look less like a face, but some claimed it may still be a face due to the fact that the photo was taken in cloudy weather. In 2001, a photo was taken that did not look like a face at all, but a natural landform such as a butte or mesa. It is unlikely that aliens would make a landform like this, because it has no actual structure. Statues and monuments made by humans are meant to look like something and tend to be uniform in shape. The Face on Mars, in more recent photographs, doesn't look like anything but what it probably is, which is a natural landform.

Another reason it is probably a natural landform is because theories that it was made by aliens were created purely by the public. There is no actual evidence that would suggest that the the face on Mars was made by anything that was alive, other than the fact that a blurry photograph taken 40 years ago makes it look like a face. There is not any evidence to suggest that Mars would have even been able to support life in the past or is able to support it now.

The evidence against the Face on Mars being made by aliens or an ancient civilization on Mars is far too substantial to be dismissed in favor of speculation by conspiracy theorists or depictions of it in fictional movies. In fact, the face on Mars strongly resembles landforms on Earth that were formed naturally. The most likely explanation for the face is that it's a natural formation that looked like a face in a photograph, and that anything special about it is purely speculated. It is completely illogical to think that an optical illusion means anything, and until there is evidence to suggest that it isn't, the Face on Mars is probably nothing more than a hill.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,4,4
"Many places around the world have been taking charge and limiting car use to the public. There comes some great advantages when doing this. You can help limit greenhouse gases, relieve the stress from cars, and become less dependent on your car for transportation.

The big advantage about limiting cars is to help prevent the rapid spread of greenhouse gases the creates smog in cities. From source two you learn that cold nights and warm days cause the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions polluting cities even more. With these dangerous gases in the air, the world is in great danger of becoming unhealthy and we are to blame for this awful cause because of the over use of cars. By limiting the use of cars you limit the amount of pollution in the air.

By limiting car use an finding other means of transpotation, you can actually relieve stress put on you from the constant beeping and noises made by cars. By walking or riding a bike you hear the nice peaceful sounds of the great outdoors while knowing you are doing good to you and the environment. Some people, as seen in source three, have taken this experience of the limiting of cars to share the experience with thier companion riding a two-seated bike. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

By limiting the use of cars you begin to be less depended on cars. By this happening you learn your life will know longer be circled around your car and you begin to see that driving a car everyday is not really needed. By using public transportation of car-pooling you greatly decrease the amount of pollution in the air while also having a ride to work or where ever you need to be.

Limiting cars can have multipal advantages to it. You can help stop half of the greenhouse gases that are caused from cars, relieve stress, and become less dependent for the need a car. This will cause you to become a better citizen and help make the world last longer for hundreds of generations to come.",3,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1

"My opinion on driverless cars is that i dont think

they are a good idea because some people enjoy driving, like me for example i have never gotten the chance to drive but i would really like too. If they were make driverless cars i might have to ""wait my turn"". Which means that when the car decides that it can't handle it anymore its going to make me drive it. I would like to drive the car at all times like it says in the article."" the google simple announces when the driver should be ready to take over.

The idea of a driverless cars just make me want to know why someone would think of this i mean if you have a driverless car it ,ight toose funiction at anytime, and the driverless cars is basically all technology which mean it would malfunction at anytime just like your computure, or phone. A driverless car is a danger to society because so may things can go wrong with it. A driverless car could cause a big accedint if something goes wrong with it when its in motion.

If your cellphone or computer needs to be traded out every two years would it be the same with a car? I mean if the car starts doing things that could put people in dantger is it going to be bad.If there was to be in accedint would it be the cars fault or the drivers fault? If the car was in an accedint some people might say that it was the cars fault they might lie and try to sew whoever made the car.like it says in the article "" who is at fault the driver ot the manufactuer. No one would know so i think that the car is a bad idea.

The car might also have a positive effect like somepeople like to text and drive like they have an addiction to there phone. If someone decides that they want to send a text messege while driving they wouldn't be driving and i thyink that thats pretty cool. If tyhe cars would be invented would textuing and driving still be illegel? Cops wouldn't be able to pull you over because you weren't driving i also think that is pretty cool. That is my opinion on the driverless car.",3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear State Senator,

I think we should change our voting system. Electoral College has it's flaws. We know it's the traditional voting system. It has some unfair advantages. Allow me to explain and convice you to changing our voting system.

Under the electoral college, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who turn elect the president. The electors could be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors will depend on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central commitee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Voters can't always control whom thier electors vote for. Voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and those electors could always defy the will of the people. Oh, and what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfairto voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend much time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.

Sincerely, PROPER_NAME",1,3,2,3,1,2,3,3,2
"I believe the Face is just a natural landform. I disagree that the face is created by aliens. First, the ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon, so of course there will be fasle information in magazines and etc. Second, What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa landforms common around the American West. Third, Mars Global Surveyor also drew close enough for a second look. When the first time on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, realing.. a natural landform. Like all the others are coomon landforms around the American West. There was no alien monument after all. But not everyone was satisfied yet. Others still not believing there were no alien monument. Prepaps said skeptics, alien marking were hidden by haze. On April 8, 2001, Malin's team captured an ectraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxumum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also said, ""So, if there were obejects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!"" Overall, Mars Global surveyor, Micheal Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera MOC team did their job of going back three times and checking about the alien monument skeptics were wondered about.",1,4,3,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Can you imagine sitting in class taking a test on a computer and all of sudden you hear your teacher say, "" The computer gave me a message saying by the way you are looking at the test the camera read your face, and is saying your 93 percent nervous and 7 percent confused. Why didn't you study? "". The computer read tour facial muscles and gave your teacher feedback. I think using technology to read students emotions would not be valuable in a classroom.

Even though have a computer or some machine telling me that i feel a certain way sounds cool, it's not going to benefit students in a school enviroment. I say this because , students already stress enough. Why tell them that they're stress? That will make thing worse. Say for instince, a student is having a bad day andhe comes to class mad your tell they're mad is just goin to make them MORE mad. In the artice it saids, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions..."" there are way more than six emotions that exist. So what happens when your non of those emotions, say your depressed and computer says your angry, then the computer is wrong.

One other thing everyone says, phones and elcetronics are a destraction to teens, why bring a machine in to the agurement and tell the students they aren't in a good mood. So everytime they a feeling a certain way they are worried about someone else telling them how they feel because a machine said they feel some type of way. Therefore making the worry about someone elses in their business and trying to mask the emotions completely so a computer system won't detect any emotion, instead of doing the work assigned in class.

In conclusion, the use of technology is good to certain point, and bringing a machine that reads peoples emotions to a school with moody teens is not a good idea. It will eventually cause more problems that wouldn't of been started if someone else unwillingly told them how they felt.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,2,0
"There are many people in the world who strive to meet their goals, regardless of the dangers it beholds. For the planet, Venus, however, The challenge for studying the planet is a big challenge. There are numerous examples to how studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. They can be communicated through these three instances: Venus has similar traits to earth, it is our closest neighboring planet,

One reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is becuase of the similar, Earth-like traits it has. Astronomers have made a hypothisis saying that Venus has similar traits to earth, as well as possibly having some sort of lifeforms developing on that planet. ""Astronomers are facinated by venus because it may well once have one well been the most earth-like planet in our solar system"". Despite the challege, Astronomers wish to explore venus to see if the traits on that planet are similar to earth.

Another reason why Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers is because it is are closest neighboring planet.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars would be able to handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. Driverless cars would be a great advance in technology and would be safe as well. In fact, none of the cars developed are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead rquires human skills. Three ways driverless cars would be much more safe are, the car will notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The car is quick to get the drivers attention when a problem occurs, and the car can turn off electornics when the driver needs to take the wheel.

In the passage it states, the car will notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This feature gives the sense that the driver is still in control at all times. The driverless car is in assistance to the driver, and it sees what the driver does not. The driverless car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves decreasing the chance of accidents greatly. While the driver is focused on watching the road, the car is focused on keeping the driver safe.

The car is quick to get the attention of the driver in many different ways. The driverless car has limits and there are times when it will need the driver's assistants. The driverless car alerts you in ways you can not ignore. For example, the driver's seat vibrates when the vehicle is in danger and the google car simply annouces when the driver should be prepared. In the passage it says there are other options that are under consideration like flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays.

Electronic use are often a problem while driving. The manufacturers want to make driving fun, or while your waiting you're still able to text and check social media. Manufacturers are hoping to bring in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature.

Three ways driverless cars would be much more safe are, the car will notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The car is quick to get the drivers attention when a problem occurs, and the car can turn off electornics when the driver needs to take the wheel. These ways show that the driverless car would be more efficient and safer for the human driver.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Electoral College is the way American people get to chose who they want to represent their state or country. Why get rid of a system that has few flaws and gives people a since of picking their people? Electoral College should be kept because gives candiates a fair chance and lets everyone pick a representator.

To begin, electoral college gives candiates a fair chance. In source 3 it states "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electroal votes to elect a president. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This expalins that even if only a candidate only represent one region of the country electoral college can still give them a chance to win presidency. In source 1 it states "" Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This means electoral college gives a candidate a group of supporters to help him or her win a election.

Futhermore, electoral college gives the people a right to pick a representator. In source 1 it states "" The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"". Everyone who is a United States citizen has the right to vote for who they want for representation for each state. In source 3 it states "" Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"". Thoughtful votes or people who just vote because everyone else is doing it doesnt matter. Everyone could vote for anyone with electoral college.

""Its official: The electroal college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguements in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguements against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"". I disagree with this statement because the electoral college gives candiates a fair chance to win electons and the people get to pick who they want to represent their states.

In conclusion, electoral college should be kept because it gives candidates a fair chance and allows the people to pick who they want to represent them.",3,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 had taken pictures of Mars and saw a face like form, but sad to say this discovery is just another landform. Scientist have given many evidences that the Face is landform. The evidences is that they had taken better pictures of the Face. Many people do not like to hear the truth about something that they thinks is very interesting to them, so they do not believe what others say negative about it.

NASA had sent Mars Global Surveyor to fly or Cydonia

to capture better pictures of the Face. In Unmasking the Face on Mars it states, ""... Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" That means that they had taken a better look at Cydonia and the Face. In Unmasking the Face on Mars it states that, ""Malin's team captures an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" So you could see what they were and it was a landform. Better pictures was a key to inform others that the Face is a landform and not created by aliens.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just another ordinary landform made by Mars. Scientists have given many evidences that the Face on Mars is a landform like Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Scientists have taken many better pictures of Cydonia and the Face to prove that it is a landform and not something that was created by aliens. The landform in Cydonia that people think is a face created by aliens is just another ordinary landorm on Mars.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Humans can detect what people are feeling why can't computers? The use of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) in the classroom would be beneficial because ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could be a serious asset in the classroom and it helps the student learn effectively.

The problem in today's world is students get lost and give up when they get bored and confused. They start to slack off. With this kind of technology it could help the student to stay on task and have fun while doing it. The type of technology that Dr. Huang developed could change the way students learn. This technology is personalized to the person using it. ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional comminication. So computers need to understand that too."" This quote perfectly shows how our technology is advancing and that the upcoming students would benefit from having these types of computers.

In conclusion, I would say that technology that could detect human emotions would be useful to students. Useful to everyone really. The FACS could take learning and computers to a whole new universe.",1,3,2,3,2,2,2,1,3
"In this article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Many people believe that this imprint of a human beings' face was sculpted by aliens. In this essay, I will provide many reasons why this imprint was just a natural landform that looked identical to a human face.

Scientist have discovered that this ""Face"" on Mars was just a natural landform. Many people are trying to say that the face was created by aliens. There are many ways that we could prove that aliens DID NOT create this fasinating landform. From far away, this imprint looks exactly like a human face. If you focuse hard enough on this sculpture, you could indentify its eyes, mouth, nose and head shape.

One of the many reasons that this artifact was not created by aliens is because, provided in the article, back on April 5th, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Scientist studied the artifact from afar, yet, they were still able to see the face. One of the scientist, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took pictures of this marvelous sculpture. As Michael looked closer into each picture, he discovered that the creation was not carved that way in any sort. He discovered that the artifact was just a landform that began to age that way.

Another way to prove this artifact was not created by aliens is, there was no one there at the planet Mars. Scientist looked all over the planet, circled it for a long period of time. There was no foot prints, or any marks on this planet. Many believed that no matter how hard they searched, the solution would come out possitive. No one came and created this impressive land.

In the passage it says on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Each pixel spanned about 1.56 meters in 2001. The best Viking photo in 1976 was measured out to be 43 meters per pixel. This is when they knew for a fact that this landform was not something anyone else was able to make. This was all just a huge coincedense that there was a face imprinited on our called, ""Red Planet"".

This is why we should believe that ""the Face"" was just a natural landform. All facts has proven, that this creation was just part of Mars. There was no clear explaination that an alien would come and create this. If aliens tend to exist, there's no possible way they would know the facial structures of a human face.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Auto-mobiles have been used as the average use of transpotation ever since the

Was there any other reason to use anything other than a car after that, no not really but now there are. After so many decades there arrives three valid reasons to limit the average joes use of their motor vehicle. One, you can reduce the smog build up in your cities, two; as well as smog greenhouse gases heavy up on areas in the Earths atmosphere but can be helped, three; people use public transportaion more as well as riding their bikes and walking. if you can limit your selves on car use, you can create a better tomorow.

First off, reducing smog in your area. smog is generated out of the tail pipes of motor vehicles and is bad for the enviroment and atmosphere. with limiting your daily car commute you can remove a good part from your area. when Paris had ordered that only plates that only odd number plates could drive on the roads on monday their large smog cloud of 147 micrograms of PM per cubic meter smog was greatly reduce and lifted the following day. so just one day of cutting the daily car commute in half a city as big as Paris was able to lift a smog.

moving along, the green house gases. Green house gases a like smog is a by product of driving your every day car to and fro work. green house gases are dangeours chemical gases that eat away at earths Ozone layer letting in UV rays that can be very harmful to you and the rest of the ecosystem. Bogata recently had a car free day in which no one was allowed to drive motor vehicles except for buses and taxis. their goal was to promote alternative uses of transportation as well as lowering the amount of green house gases let into Earths atmosphere. doing something like what bogata can help cut down on all the harsh chemicals being let off into the atmosphere.

lastly, finding other sources of transportaion other than every day car. finding another way of getting around is great for the community, it keeps you healthy and the earth healthy. Vauban germany is actually a car free city, it does not have roads on which you can drive upon but only a main street. everything that is needed in the town is no longer a car ride away but a bike ride away or a walk down the road resulting in a very community both people and ecosystem. as well as that is also saves people money not haveing to buy or a car for that matter. now think on how it would be like if your city did this and how much it would benefir from it.

In conclusion, having a car free day or banning about half the cars from driving on one day is not a bad thing but instead a good thing. once again you can reduce the smog, you ca even help keep green house gases out of the atmosphere, and for the last time find other healthier ways of getting around. so to ask the simple question why would you not limit your everyday car use.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"State Senator,

If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? How can a president win the popular vote but lose the presidency? None of that makes any sense. Our nation needs to abolish the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The system of the Electoral College is irrational, unfair, and not for the citizens.

To begin, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" (Plumer, paragraph 13). ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Plumer, paragraph 11). If the United States is really all about the citizens, then they do not have a good way at showing it. We as citizens live here, and call this nation our home, but yet we can not even elect our own president. The Electoral College is unfair to us as voters.

In addition, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a state of electors."" (Posner, paragraph 15). That textual evidence came from a passage in defense of the Electoral College! We the people should have a say! This system is not for us as citizens of the United States, and it is wrong! This is our home so let US pick our president.

Furthermore, ""... and the most thoughful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" (Posner, paragraph 20). This statement is very true because voters should be thorough when voting, but why should we be? It is not like we need to take our time and compare and contrast the presidential candidates. We are not voting for the president of our choice, so what is the point of being thorough? It is wrong to have this system, and it needs to be changed.

To conclude, as I have said above, If the slogan of our nation is ""We the people,"" why do we the people not actually get to vote for the president? The system of the Electoral College needs to be abolished. It is not letting us as citizens elect our choice of the president that we want. It is unfair and irrational. I am in favor of changing the system to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.",3,4,2,3,1,2,1,1,2

First,  to some people the lelctoral college could be a good thing or some people dont like it. like for example voters dont vote for the president they vote for slate of electors. then the ones woth the most they detreman who will become the next presiden. i dont  really like the way tha is works i feel like we should just vote for the president. alsop its kinda confusing with the hole electrol votes and like florida has 34 electoral votes.

Second, who picks the elector in the first place? is it us is the other senator who? also when there is a tie and it has to go in the house of representatives then they chose like what is there is more demcratic thats kinda of unfair. but i understand about why they like it too.

conclusion, I could understand why people like it to for example they actually let the people chose istead of not and then the world just gets crazy. Also it is what our founding fathers created and they had to compermize it.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are some advantages of limiting cars, The pollution is horrible and very bad for the enviorment, No traffic jams or car accidents, Not Spending a lot of money. Read on to find out more why limiting car usage isnt that bad at all.

Paris enforced a partial driving bam to clear the air of the global city after a couple days of near record pollution. Cold nights and hot days effected the warm layer of air that trapped pollution. Diesel Vehicles were blamed for the polluition here. 67% of vehicles in France are Diesel. It brought in Congestion and Very bad Smog.

Colombia had a ""Car-free Day"" in which alot of Colombians walked, hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work. There were raley any traffic jams. Imagine everybody showing up to work on time and not being stuck in a traffic jam. Colombia is trying to make an alternative way of transporting and to reduce smog. So they Fined $25. Then cities around Colombia jumped on Board.

By Limiting car usage we can limit the amount of money we spend on the vehicles. Like buying fuel for the vehicle, Buying the vehicle, money to fix the vehicle if it breaks. If we could limit car uasge we could save our fossil fuels we could save our money. We are slowly running out of diesel fuel. Some say we should be out of diesel fuel by 2030.

Now You Know some of the advantages of limiting car usage. Adding more pollution is for the enviorment, No Traffic Jams or Car acciedents. Not Spending alot of money. Those are just 3 out of hundreds of advantages of limiting car Usage. Some people have even given up cars now. They go to walking, biking, skating. It even helps yo car pool. Avoids traffick. Less Smog and Pollution and more fossil fuels to save.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0
"Is technology that can read your emotional expressions usefull or valuable? How can this benifit the classroom? A computer being able to read your emotions doesnt seem pleasent, but it could benifit you. Maybe if the computer can tell if your feeling a certain emotion such as anger, it can help settle you down by bringing up something of your interest. Or in a classroom, if a student becomes bored or even consused and the computer can sense that, then the technology could pop up a instructer, to help the student concentrate.

How do you know that a compuder reading your emotons is safe? Studying of emotions have been practiced for decades, mostly starting with Mona Lisa, the painting done by famous Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo studied human anatomy to justify and express certain emotions on well known art pieces. Emotions can be very unpredictable because people have so many different reactions to certain things.

The Facial Action Coding System, an innovation from Prof.

Produced at the Beckman institute for Advanced Science in the University of Illinios. This technology was made by Dr. Haung and his colleagues. This technologgy was invented to help computers and humans connect more on a personal level, helping the computer undertsand more, and to better help the human. The technolagy can construct a 3-D model of the face in the systen and predict certain emotions by little behaviors that the person does. Such as, rasing your eyebrows when you suprised or interested, and tightening around your lips when your emotion is anger. While some people my be for this, others may feel againt that kind of connection between technology and a person. Others may feel danger with that sense of curiousity. If a computer can sense a ceratain emotion and can possibly change that emotion, you dont know if the computer would cause you to feel worse, or even isolated. There could be a glitch in the systen that could cause danger to the person. Or even a hacker could be able to go through a computer, causing a virus that can make other people look through your camera. With the pros also come the cons, through if this type of technology is used approprietly it could really benifit society.",2,1,1,1,0,0,1,2,1
"Have you ever read the article The Challenge of Exploring Venus. It says that there are many reasons why it was alike and how it does not seem alike Earth anymore. There are reasons of temperature the pressure on how it is not alike. They said Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and had various life forms.

How is Earth and Venus alike? In the article it said it is the planet most alike so I guess we are not that alike then. Scientists thought maybe a long time ago that Venus was like Earth. They Said that is was probably covered largley with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. It says that Venus has a rocky sediment surface. That includes valleys, mountians, and craters. So if Venus and Earth were alike would part of Venus be steep because of the oceans?

Venus and Earth have some major differences. It has a ninety-seven percent cabon dioxide atmosphere blanket. Which Earth's atmosphere blanket is way thinner but getting up there from all of people's realsing carbon dioxide. The cloud in Venus are highly sulfuric acid which is not good because if people lived there we would die from the acid rain and would not have any food to eat because it will also die. There would also be no water for us to drink. So no matte what we would most likely die there.

Venus and Earth have a huge temperture difference. Earth's normal temperature is like high 80 degrees Fahrenheit the low is like negative 20 degrees Fahrenheit. In Venus its average temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit. We would be burnt to death. Venus is also the hottest plant in our solar system even though it is the seconf planet from the sun. Another thing that Venus and Earth are different in is the atmosperic pressure. I do not know what Earth's atmosperic pressure is but is no where near what Venus's gets. Venus's atmosperic pressure 90 times greater than Earth's.

There are also things to think about because of Venus's high amount of everything and is the size of Earth what thing will do. Like how rapid the weather will change will have to be cautious about it changing like in a split second or will it take over years for the weather to change. I wonder what the lowest temperature will be. Does Venus have volcanos? If so how bad will it affect the people living there. We also have to think about things like earthquakes and how the building will hold together if they happen. How many time will lightning strikein like a minutes. Will Venus have enough water to with stand people and grow crops. Is it even safe to live there? What will be the days or even how long the day will last.

Scientists want to study Venus so in case Earth ever does stop working in the case rotating and obiting the sun we have somewhere close in distance to travel to. There are many dangers in traveling to Venus, but there are people out there will to risk the lifes for our future to see if we can live in other planets.

In conclusion, I do not think that we should send people to somewhere that we know is not safe. There are no many reasons why I do and do not like Venus. I also think we should send people there to see if humans can with stand all of it. My main reason I think that we should not is because of water, food, and the acid rain. I also think that it will be fun to discover another planet. I always wanted to go to Venus when I was little. I remember always arguring with my family of what planet was the sister planet of Earth I was alway right even as a little kid.",2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Knowing that its someone they voted for ad not someone in which the electoral college votes for and decides to make the president. some presidents win the popular vote but still lose the presidency because they didnt get enough electoral votes.

"Can you imagine living in a time zone where no one buys cars because they are no longer needed ? The world depend on nothing but technolgy. How would you spend your time? Although there are positive apsects to having a car that drives itself there are also negative aspects to this car. The cars can drive themselves but are unable to drive through traffic jams or raod work . Therefore I am against cars that drive themselves.

Even though the cars are smart enough to drive themselves they are not smart enough to drive on non-smart roads. In the late 1950s GM ,General Motors created a car that could run on a speacial track but the track was enbedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to the car. Therefore all roads would have to require upgrades and this is something that is too expensive. The passage says that the cars can't drive through traffic jams,road contruction and when the vehicle is around danger . So if the driver is not paying attention to the car , the road and others around it then how can the car ,the car would be unable to save itself from crashing. With this being said I believe driverless cars are dangerous and would be way to expensive.

As i said there are benefits to this driverless car , while the car drives it self it provides enteratinment such as sound but when it is time for the driver to take over it turns everything off. This is a great idea because it creates less distraction for the driver.

Imagine driving a driverless car and it shuts down in the middle of traffic ,there is a person driving behind does not notice you are having car troubles and hits you. Whose fault is this accident ? Whose going to pay for the damage?

I feel that there are more downfalls with this idea than great ideas .It is dangerous , too expensive , and takes as much energy and time as driving yourself around. It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen .",3,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0

Most of the time they have to ask for rides from there children or grandchildren, in which can be annoying cause who really wants to ride with younger people. Then here comes the driveless car, an older person in which I feel will be more safe in this car because they are more careful then younger people.

The driveless car can help the elders get where they need to go without them driving. They can get in the car and just pay attention to the road. This can stop some several problems between family, because little arguments cause the older person needs a ride can tear a family apart, but with the driveless car everything will be better in that case.

The driveless car can be a bad idea because it can cause problems with teens. Now we do have teens driving and really drive out of control. The driveless car is dangers because some teens don't drive safe, they like to get reckless and show out. So lets say a teen get this driveless car and think its pretty cool, so of course their gone to want to show it off. The teen drives one day and thinks its okay to text and drive and an accident happens. So now there's death and causes that this car isn't safe. A teen is the main people who text and drive now with regular cars.

There's a slight differences with the regular car and the driveless car dealing with teens. The regular keeps a team eyes on a road more then it will on a driveless car. A driveless car remember you aren't DRIVING so a teen will be more focused on their phones instead of the road. While using a regular car a teen have to focus on the road and his or her car and eventually they will justcput the phone down.

In short a driveless car in my perspective the car is safer for elders then teens because elder are more controling. A elder person is going to be safer because they pay attention to the road and other drivers around him or her. A teen doesn't really pay attention at all times because him or her is checking their phone and don't mind other drivers.",3,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,0
"This essay is on if I think the use of technlogy to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable . I believe It is valuable and heres why .

I believe the use of tehcnology to read students expressions is valuable because as a studnt myslf i know how it feel to have to do a computer assignment and not get whats going on or its moving to fast so u get frustrated or angry .If they were able to put that in school computers i feel more kids will do better in school . Like if my facial exprassions are showing a teacher some they cant really get it because they are humans ad they cant really read faces s good as a computer could . Now on the other hand you have this computer that when i look confused it is willing to slow down or break things down more simplier for me and me only .

I feel sometimes thats all kids need is extra help because honestly im a student that needs extra help thats only a little bit of the reasons why i think that is valuable . Students facial expressions show everything you need to know you just have to get something to catch them . Of course they are going to have to make sure its spot on . What if i completely understanding everything and then they start to break it down then what ? Because tehcnology is not perfect .

That is a counter arguement someone can make . What if my facial expression is showing one thing but im feeling a different way . Technology always has a bug or something that nees to be fixed . So whoeer makes this needs to make sure that it is perfect .

Thats why i think this ablility to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable .",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Our home called Earth will not last forever. In thousands of years to come we will need a new home if we want humans to survive. The author in the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has given us a possibility of a new home.

Venus is known to be Earth's twin. Earth and Venus has similarities but also differences. Scientist and inventors can help make us adapt to Venus's enviroment. Venus has many harsh living enviroments like average temperatures being over eight hundard degrees fahrenheit, atmospheric pressure is ninty times greater than Earth, hottest surface temperature, and even intense weather. None of these dangers can stop us entirely. Venus may have some harsh conditions but us humans can survive if we put effort into it. The author has provided information about how we can adapt to Venus's lifestyle. He has done research about past inventions from world war II that could help us with inventions that could survive the intense heat and also many other ideas.

Not only do scientists believe this could happen but even NASA. NASA has came up with a solution to be able to create hostile conditions, so us humans can survive on the hot surfaces on Venus. If scientist and NASA continue to do their job and commit to Venus then humans will never have to be scared of us humans loosing our home. It may not be our generations but many generations to come will thank these people who have put thier time, effort, and brains to help make Venus our second home.

Dedication and Imagination can lead us to the Evening Star.

All we need is to be brave and try new things. The author has shown us a new way to live and proved to the readers we can make it happen. I'll be hoping to see you on the spaceship to Venus, our new home.",2,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,1
"The use of the Facial Action Coding System, to read emotional expressions of students, isn't valuable. It is in fact an incredible use of technoogy and it also would be neat to see how people are feeling, but you shouldn't be able to know how people are feeling without them personally telling you themselves. What if there is something someone is trying to hide? Something that is very personal and other people shouldn't know about, but you an see how they're feeling so you insist they tell you.

The technology might not actually work. I t might jut be a scam to make people think that they're feeling certain way about something. It shoudn't be possible to just use a machine to tell how someone is feeling inside.

The Facial Action Coding System was a very clever device. You could see how someones feeling in a picture, in person, you could even see how people feel towards homework. Even though it is a very interesting use of technology, you shouldn't be able to tune into other people's emotions, even if they are your students. Which is why this use of tehnology is not valuable.",1,3,0,2,1,1,1,2,2
"The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy because it use to be just like earth and thers alot of things we still need to discover because it could be habbitable for humans to lie on it later in life and if with the right tecnology we could explore and learn about the planet more.

In paragraph 4 the text states ""if our sister planet is so inhositable why are scientists even discusiing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some Earth like features that are analogeous to those on Earth. Also in paragraph 5 the text states "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions but surviable for humans.

thisa rpoves that venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1,2,3,1,0,1,1,1,0
"I think that they should change to the elecetion by popular vote for the president of the united states. Then that would let people choose who wins. They have been using electoral college for a while but i think popular vote would be better.

""Its official: the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Electoral college voting is bad because it cant let the people choose who they want for president. ""Its hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abloish the electoral college!"". ""This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. What gives?"". By Bradford plumer fam .

""Under the 23rd amendment of the consitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college"" - the office of federal register. Those electors shouldn't be able to choose who runs for president. It should be the peoples choice. Congress should not be allowed to choose who runs for presidents.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Since I turned fifteen all I could remember dreaming of was my sixteenth birthday and getting a license, like most normal teenage girls. I just couldn't hold back on the feeling I got just thinking about a car and that freedom I would finally have as a licensed driver. That's when my mom decided how important it was to take care of the planet, and how I should dedicate my time to making this planet all the more greener. I've always been interested in the environment so I though about all the ways I could stay green...with a car that is. What most people don't understand however is the amount of pollution we have in our planet today and how we can do few simple things to avoid it, that's right girls, stop worrying so much about the car and focus more on how you could limit car usage and the advantages of doing so such as avoiding more polution, walking which can actually help you health wise and maybe even saving money on gas;  a little green for green.

The amount of polution we have here in dear mother earth is just astonishing. Take Paris for example which happens to have more smog than any other European capital. This kind of polution isn't only bad for the environment however, it also affects us as individuals, polution can not only intoxicate our planet but us as well. Rather than spending a life time figuring out solutions and filling our bodies up with medication we should just be avoiding the problem once and for all, kill it at its source. Avoid using so much car travel that at the end of the day, a bus can take you to the same place and best of all, it comes guilt free.

Adding to the whole idea of a healthy lifestyle and environment, try walking, which by the way also prevents car usage and so kills two birds with one stone. If you drop the keys and pick up a pair of running shoes your helping to save the envoironment and at the same time guaranteeing a longer life for yourself. Take Bogota, Colombia for instance and its brilliant idea of Car-free day. Yes, it's exactly as it sounds; a whole day dedicated to reducing car usage, and although they still allow buses and taxis on the streets, regualr every day use cars are 100% banned. Whats the point of this you may ask? Well, it all must begin somewhere, one action creates a chain reaction.

One of an average persons problems here in America involve financial issues, especially now with the economy we have, gas prices aren't the same. How can you avoid a situation like this that may even help you cut down on your daily budget? How about taking other methods of transportation for a change? This way you save extra money for other necessities and at the same time, help clean out our environment by changing up your daily car trips here and there. Although it may not seem like much, a little bit of something can make a huge difference.

All in all, I believe it is important for everyone to undestand how essential it is that we put some thought into our world, especially those eager to drive. Just take a minute out of your eveyday busy schedules and find ways to reduce reuse and recycle to make our world even better for our future generations.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I think that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should join because you could be helping the lives of the lives of thousands of innocent people whose homes where destroyed in the wars. One of the interesting things of joining the program is that you can see a amazing sights from all around the world.

It is an unbelieveable opportunity for a small-town boy. Helping these people you can get the benefit of going to China and Europe and their famous landmarks. If you go to Italy there is a chance you could ride in a gondola in Venice,Italy. When i was in Crete is saw an excavated castle. On your way to China you can marvel your eyes at the Panama Canal. If your not in the mood for sight seeing you can go downstairs with some of you co-workers and play some baseball,volleyball,fencing,boxing,reading,whittiling,and Table-tennis to help pass the time while on board.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me.

It opened up the world to me and was vey grateful for the opportunity. It made me more aware of peolple in other countries and their needs. That awareness stayed with me for along time. It lead my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years. If you had any job or chore working on a farm then this job will be great for you.

When your on night watchman duty be careful when it rains. Because when I was on night watchman duty it was raining cats and dogs. I was climbing down a ladder when my foot slipped and I fell in my side. I nearly slid stright off the deck. But before i could fall i grabbed on to a piece of metal before i could fall off. I couldn't work for a few days because of a few cracked ribs. But if you do join just know that your co-workers are there to help you with injuries.

In conclusion, I think that you should join our Seagoing Cowboy program.

Not only will you be helping us by joining but you will also help innocent lives of people who were harmed in the war.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"In the article, ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves."" A boy named Luke Bomberger went on an ""adventure"" as an Seagoing Cowboy. There are positive and negative things about the ""adventure."" But, I still think people should try out the Seagoing Cowboy programs, because you you can see many wonderful views and ects.

One reason people should try out the Seagoing Cowboys program is, you can visit many places that you haven't been before like, China, Europe, and ects. Imagine your living in U.S.A right now, and you dream is to go to Europe. Your dream can come true from trying the Seagoing Cowboy programs! Also, places like Europe and China have their own cultures, which are extremely different from U.S.A's culture. According to paragraph 5, it said: ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."" So, not only you can visit wonderful places, you can also help people at the same time!

Another reason is, you can play games like baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, and ects. Playing sports is one of the most popular thing to do in the world. When people have fun doing things, it feels like time pass away extremely fast. The adventure may take weeks or even months, but with fun things like these sports, it'll feel short.

Like I said in the first paragraph, you can see many wonderful views. This reason kind of connect to the visiting places that you've never been before, because when you go to a new place, there will be new things you'll see and learn about. Like I said before, most places have different culture. You can find new things or learn something. Some places have different languages to other countries/states. So, maybe you'll learn new languages and you can communicate with people.

These are some reasons why people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. It might take a long time to travel, but it'll be fun! There might be chances the participators will get hurt, but what is life withour a few accidents?

Lke Bomberger had participate in this program many times, but he still think it's wonderful. According to paragraph 9, Luke said: ""I'm grateful for the opportunity,"" he says. ""It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."" That represents he think this program is magnificent and fun!",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"I would like our election to be cast on popular vote. It would make more sense for us to be able to elect our president by what everyone thinks and not the electoral college because many things can go wrong. The votes in electoral college don't make sense big states have more votes then the little ones so the candidates focus on big states and the other ones are left out because they have two or three votes. Thats why I think we need a different system or just cast it on popular vote.

Just like the 2000's election Bush won that by getting the bigger states when Gore should've won it because he had more popular votes. The electoral college makes no sense and should be taken down. Many people disagree with the electoral college and know its a big scam for the presidents to win by losing. Thats why it should be casted on popular so its fair for people and not on the size of your state.

The electoral college is an outdated, unfair system on voting. It shouldn't be about the state but what all of the country thinks. Popular vote is the best way to caculate who should be president and who not to be. Our nation would be better off with a new system because the electoral college is getting outdated and isn't a good way to vote for who leads our country. We need a new system because in several places they never seen a candidate or ad to vote in 2000 campaign. Those states didn't see anything because of their electoral votes are small compared to those of the bigger states.

Also you can tie the votes in electoral votes and then we'd have to worry about the vote our House of Representatives would give us. That could be a disaster for us to worry about. Just like Nixon and Clinton had 43 percent of popular vote but winning in the electoral college. Its not fair for most people and it doesn't make sense how he can win but still be losing at the same time. I wouldn't vote until this system is changed because it is completly unfair.

The electoral college is an unfair system that no one wants anymore. We can change our ways of voting so it'll be more fair and it matters on our country's thoughts not our states. Popular vote seems more reasonable and a better way for us to find a good leader. Thats why i think it should be casted on popular vote instead of the electoral college and the United States of America would be better off with what our whole country thinks instead of our size because we represent freedom and need to prove it.",3,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"My claim for using the technology is great thing. Do you use technology everyday of your life? It could help kids out by making them interested in about what they are learn. The technology could tell what old paintings of people inthe old times and tell them wat they were feeling. I think it a great technology improvement to the world.

The FACS could help kids when they are getting borad of the school work and it could change it where they get more involed in it. The technology could make the kid do better in school if they lear then material in a different way that other. If a kid gets borad of his work and the computer that he is wrking on changes the way he lears it in a better way and a more fun way to learn the material.

The technology could tell what pecent of each emotions the old painting had. Just like the the Mona Lisa was feeling like she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. If we could figure out what all the paint of people and what they were feeling. This could tell us a lot about the person we were learning about.

This technology could change the life of the world. It could help us what percent of people were happy,sad, disgrusted, fearful,and angry. It could tell us whywe had all the war and what the Leader were thing when they satrted the war. This technology could figure out why we had all the problems we had in the past. The technology could change the way video games work or video surgery.

These are the reason why I think weshould have the technology. People could learn diferent way on how to do thing and kids wouldnt get tired of school. The technology help a lot of the world and teaches them how you can use it later in life. Could learn about what past people felt and figure out what happen in the past. I dont see why people think technology id bad because if help with everything in our life and teaches to use our rescoues. Would you agrre with me on my claim why we should have this technology?",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this.",2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Computers, we all like using computers it's one of the things more used around the world. Computers are use at work, school, home, hospitals and ect. Since computers are use so much around the world it's only right that people keep making new advance computers that can change the future. How advance can computers get.? Well by reding this article it shows the new level of computer that people have made.

New software from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Ilinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam that can reed how you feel even do if you fake it. According with the article it says this new 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscle in the model most move like a human muscle, so it can detect the feeling. They classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. This it's crazy it says if you not smiling right, like happy there a video imagery that recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. Some times we have trouble describing the look in our friend face if they happy sad or ect., but Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.

I personal think this is a bad ideal, becuase people feeling its very personal. Example

if someone in your family die and you feel so sad put you don't want people to know about it and here comes a computer and detects your feeling and people going to start asking, ""oh hey, why are you so sad"" and that will make people more mad. I mean i could work sometimes like if you see a girl and the computer detects that she sad and need someone, you could go and try to make her happy and see if that changes something. I think a lot of people won't like it either because they think it's violationg their feelings. I think this computer will work if only used the right way, i mean for something good or to help people be happy.",3,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Most kids find school very boring, espesically because you wake up early almost every day and go to this place where you use your brain all day. Using this new technology I think would help schools out a lot because it would help them understand what a student is thinking everyday at school. In the article it states ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait"" this system could see through your expressions and right to what you're thinking.

This new technology would be very intresting to have in a classroom just so the teachers could know what you are thinking emotionally. I can kind of see where this could be interupting your privacy but sometimes a teacher should know if your having a hard time or if your even bored in class. Knowing your getting bored in there class would make me as a teacher want to try something differently. Just by reading this article the machine sounds kind of cool it can read what your emotions are just by scanning your face, thats crazy.

Finally after my opinion this machine hopefully you agree with me on this because some schools might wanna try it out. Some teachers need to know what there students are thinking and you know 90 percent are probably going to be bored. So now it is up to the teachers to make it less boring because they know now that your not interested in what they're teaching. Therefore, I think schools need this technolgy in classrooms because it could benifit the teachers in many ways.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"There is fasinations in venus because of many reasons , such as its similarities to Earth and the myterious dangers behind the planet its self. The passage is biased that travels beyond earth on a another world shold not be guarded by the dangers and doubts it upholds.

"Looking out at a city nowadays can be difficult with all the smog around. Cars litter the strrets and parking spaces, no trees just cars and exaust. The biggest cities, that were onced beautiful are now being looked down upon because of one simple thing. Los Angeles, New York, Paris any one of them is being destroyed because almost every human has or had a car, and they cant seem to be able to live without it.

However in Vauban, Germany ""They have given up their cars."" Vauban, Germany was completed in 2006 to help suburban life move away from auto use. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive ares in the Unitednited States,' ( In Geman suburb, a life goes on without cars)

"Who would you believe, a couple of conspiracy theorists without proven research or scientist with proven research? In 1976, Viking 1 was circling mars and took a picture which seemed to look like a human face. Later, research proved that it was just a landform equivalen to a butte or mesa. People still believed it was an alien creation. I believe the landform on Mars was not an alien creation because: if it was an alien creation NASA would benefit from it, Mars Global Surveyor snapped a photo proving a landform, and in 2001 another photo was taken clearly showing a mesa or butte.

First, if the landform was an alien creation NASA would have benefited from it. In paragraph five, the author stated, "" Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" The author is telling us that NASA wouldn't hide that a civilization created the landform because they would get a better financial stand. The author stated in paragraph five as well, "" Some people think the Face is a 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This theory is clearly proven to be wrong.

Secondly, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and capture a photo of the Face which was a landform. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped the photo that was ten times sharper than the Viking photos. In paragraph 7, the author stated, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image fist appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This on photo proved that not only was it not an alien monument, but that it was a natural landform.

Finally, in 2001, another photo was taken by Mars Global Surveyor to capture a second look of the Face. In paragraph ten, the author states, "" ' Malvin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The camera in 2001 was clearly better than the camera in 1976 than the one the Viking had. Also, the digital image taken in 2001 was made 3 times bigger than the pixel size, showing that it was a landform that was a butte or mesa.

In conclusion, I believe that the landform on Mars in not an alien creation because: NASA would have benefited if it was an alien creation, the Mars Global Surveyor snapped a photo in 1998 showing it was only a landform, and in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor also snapped a more precise photo clearly showing it was a landform equivalent to a mesa or butte. All this proves that conspiracy theorist were wrong all along about aliens creating the land form.

"Should cars drive themselves? This might be the dream of many who think of the future, but reality is driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. Although car companies argue that driverless cars are becoming safer and safer, they fail to see many serious shortcomings. Cars shouldn't drive themselves because, they are incapable of adapting to dangerous situations fast, they can create many difficult legal problems and scenarios, and humans would not be able to pay attention whenit was needed.

Moreover cars that drive themselves will never be able to replace human logic, reasoning, and intelligence. Computers, like those in driverless cars are programmed with a specific list of actions and reactions. While a human can discern when to do specific tasks, computers on the other hand can only give a reaction from a premade list. Therefore a computer can be stimulus similiar to something else, but then react to it wrongly due to them having no ability to discern or gain experience.

Then there is also the legal problems that can come about from these cars. In paragraph 9 of this article it states,""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" There are many other problems that a automobile can raise so ultimately it's not worth the risk legally speaking. That is why, for good reason many states have prohibited the use of smart cars in their state.

Furthermore it is hard already for people to pay attention while behind the wheel and to avoid distraction and getting bored on the road. If people wwere allowed to drive in driverless cars that only alerted them when they are getting into dangerous situations they can easily become distracted and bored, making it hard to respond when their life might depend on it. A project owner of the driverless cars even admits to it when he says, ""The pyschological aspects of automation are really a challenge."" Although they propose a sloution to add an entertainment system in for a safety feature, reality is the human attention span shrinks year by year so they would have to constantly update this in order to keep the car safe.

"The article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", In the text it describes how new techonology called the Facial Action Coding System can enable to identify human emotions and it's not rignt that people can use a machine to know if your happy,sad, or angry at someone that the person personnal feelings and people have no right to know what thier feeling about something.

In a lot of ways I disagree on this new facial coding because it's not others people' s businesse to know how other's feel about what their doing. I am sure others would feel unconfertable knwoing that other people around know how you feel all the time. Somethimes when you feel alone or sadness and you don't want others to know because your not ready to tell them what's been going on and because of the Facial Action Coding System people would feel like they don't have their own personal space to think about themselfs and knowing how they feel about something.

In some ideas I agree with the article is when in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" I agree on that statement; to use this new technology for educational purposes as long as no student or teacher abusses it to know what are others feeling about you or something else. It also a good idea to use it when someoone is really depressed about something and if you feel something is gonna happen to the person and you can tell an adult to help with the problem. Is not right for someone else to know your feelings, people have no right to know what someone else is feeling because people can take advangen of someones feelings and use it agaisnt them and can hurt someone for ever and maybe it can affect someone's life in the future.

At the end people still have no business to mess or know how someone feels becuase that's the other person personal feeling but at some point the Facial Action Coding System can be useful in school because it can detect if someone is confused or having trouble understanding the assignment or chapter their going through. The article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile "" has a lot bad points but in some statements they were right.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"As a NASA scientist, I believe that the "" face "" on Mars is a natural formation. I dont believe that aliens could have formed this. During my work, I have discovered many different ways to make you believe that the face is natural.

The scientists that work with NASA, such as myself, have found many different reasons as to why the formation looks like a face. During our time photographing Mars, we have been equiped with much better quality cameras, which help us see things better on Mars itself. Over the years, we have discovered that when you use a higher quality Mars Global surveyer (MGS), the "" face "" no longer looks like a face. Still some people didn't believe us the first time we got photographs of the land mark, so went and did it again. This time, we made sure that there weren't any clouds that could default the photos of Mars. What we found out by looking at these photos is the the facial features are simply just shadows. Take the eyes for example, while photographed from the middle of the land mark, there is a shadow being created by the sun. From this angle, the sun makes the land mark seem as if it had eyes. The "" mouth "" is simply just a hole in the land mark, which looks like a mouth while photographed from the middle of the land mark. There is no way aliens could be the cause of a natural piece of land on Mars.

Now that you understand what the "" Face "" actually is, I hope you dont still think aliens were the cause of it. There is scientific proof that it is a natural piece of land that just so happened to form on Mars.",2,4,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"The author explains how studying venus can be a good thing but also very dangerous. Do to human curiosity we will most likely one day discover and possibly live on venus!

The author tells readers how NASA is working to make a "" Blimp like vehicle""

that would hover above about 30 miles above the surface. This would be good to stay out of the way of the rough ground and keep tempuatures around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Also the author explains in paragraph 4 how it was most likely just like Earth many years ago and could be possible for people to live on one day again in the near future. The author also explains in paragraph 6 that with the technoligy that we have today we would have to stay above the surface and would have to use photgraphs to show what the ground looks like from a far distance.

The author explains that NASA should spend more time making a space ship or a land cruiser that is able to withstand the heat and pressure from Venus. I think that the author has a good point in trying to find out what this planet is like, because one day it can and will be lived on. The author states that Venus is Earths ""twin"". By the author stating that, it makes me and others think that it can be used just like Eath. Some have to understand that Venus needs to have many changes before humans can live there and there is a great group of people working on that right now.

Thanks to human curiosity and to NASA one day hopefully in the near future venus can and will be a used planet. We as a whole should expand where we travel to explore new places that can be used instead of all cramping up here on Earth.",2,2,3,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions, is pointless. I say this because a persons emotions could switch very quickly. Also, this technology has been tested on paintings, paintings dont have emotions. This means that the technology is wrong.

If a website or app is detecting emotions from picture what makes you think it could detect emotions from a real peson. This ""new"" technology doesn't make any scense. Why would someone possibly let a machine tell them how there feeling. Theres no way possible that a painting has emotions, it may look sad or happy but it has no true emotions.

There are many different apps that do different things. Theres even a app that detects lies. These apps are fake. No cellphone app could really tell you if your lying or not. This technology should be tested out on many humans. Just to be sure.

Different people have different opinions, but only scientist will actually know the truth. Even scientist can be proven wrong so its more of a the world may never know type of situation. Until actual proof of this technology is being shown i personally will not believe it.",1,3,1,1,0,0,1,1,1

and human so

they need to study and research more about vesus to see if it's safe or not or if it's effecting earth.

And it also

system says that venus is a challenge plant for people to study

and scientist has found out by studying that the surface is astronomers are fascinated by venus also the solar system

so like i said venus can effect things near to it so that's what they got when they study about venus maybe of they keep studying they are going to find more things about venus.

Their are a lot's of danger over there so he sugest to scienists

to study more about venus so nothing happan on the future to the earth or other things that they are beside venus also they need to expoler more about venus cause it could be some things that they haven't found about venus yet so they can know how far it could be dangerous.

The author suggest that because on this story he found things about venus that he was not sure about and he wanted them to study more about venus to confirm it

"Just A Natural Landform

The Face has been to be called many things but its pretty clear that it is just a natural landform. If it was really made by aliens would't there be proof of actual aliens? Yeah there should be but there is no proof of aliens, so that is just more proof that the face is just a natural landform. There are many rocky parts on Mars and the face is just one of them people are over thinging it when all it is a pices of land.

Twentry- five years ago NASA's Viking 1 discovered a shadowy figuer that looked like a human face. The thing that set off the people the most was the shadowness that formed a illuison of a face. Then when the face was released to the world everyone though that it had something to do with aliens. Peolpe started to but the face in movies, magazines, make it in a book,and people would talk about it on the radio.

Very few scientist think that it was a alien which i dont think it is a alien. Then NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor to retreve more photos of the face. The pictures they retreved clearly showed that theface was just a natural landform. Think about it the pictures that were taking back in 1976 the technology wasn't great and then when they retook photos in 1998 they were so much clearer. The technology obviously inhasted over that long period of time.

But people were still not convinced so they went to take another look in 2001 and the picture was even better. People want to think aliens are real but they aren't and this so called face is has nothing to do with them. If NASA were to take more photoes of it today there would be no one who thinks its a alien. Today's technology doen't even compare to the technology they had when they took the last pictures of the face, but people are going to believe what they want.

All the facts clearly state that the face is just a natural landform. In the beginning when the face was first discovered people though it was a hard fact about aliens ,but technology got better and we could see it better to tell that it was just land. it is really clear to me that all it is a natural landform.",3,3,2,3,0,0,1,1,0
"There are many advantages to limiting car usage. Theres less green house gasses emmited. It's less money you have to spend on youre car. You dont have to deal with the dangers of drivning on the road.

When you dont drive your car as much or not at all and you get others too that makes less carbon gass going into the air. Emmitung less carbon into the air helps the enviorment stay clean and healthy. when you dont emit as much gas you help lessen the impact on global warming.

Driving less can also help your walet too. when your not driving as much you dont have to pay for as muh gas, or none at all if you dont drive any. theres also no need to pay for mantinense or broken or damaged parts if any do break.

If your not on the road then there are no dangers of driving on the road to worry about. Theres no need to worry about someone hitting you or you hitting someone. When not driving someone who is intoxicated or texting and driving cannot affect you.",1,4,0,3,0,0,0,1,1
"In the world today you will see cars just about everywhere, whether it be a toyota pirus, or an 1999 honda civic. Car no doubtly have been one of the largets, if not, the greatest invetnions this world has ever seen. Although nowadays when we start to talk negativially about the car, people seem to turn their heads away to aviod the question. Reducing the use of cars in the world would be massivally benefitial to the enviroment, and not only that, everyday life. Limiting car usage will help reduce pollution into the attmosphere through reducing carbon emmsions, it will help save money and also it will help reduce stress and tense mindsets.

One of the largest benefits of reducing car usage in the world is the reduction of greenhouse gases being relased in to the atmosphere coming out the exhaust pipes of cars. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars up to 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from cars in car congested areas. In the passage the text explains how a social expierment turned into a growing trend in Europe today. In subburban town of Vauban, many people have utitmatly given up their cars. How this was done you may ask? In the town driveways are forbidion aswell as home garages. Car Ownership isnt forbidden though,but to own a car is quite difficult and costly. With only two places to park in the whole town, it makes ownership very difficult. The lifestyle of people here without cars ultimatly reduced stress and increased health, and much happier and healthier lifestyles were made. Another example will be in Paris, France. After the city recieved near record-breaking pollution in the air, Paris officals took action. They banned driving for two days to attempt to reduce carbon emissions. The way they enforced this rule was by fines throughout the city for no cooperation. On that monday on the first day of the ban, only 4000 fines were given. Many people were complained of inconvience and companies complained of lost revenue, Although the incovencies, the ban for just one day reduced the smog almost completely and allowed for Pairs to lift the scheduled ban on that tuesday. So even though in some places the reduction of car usage may cause incovience, the reduction carbon emuissions cant go unnoticed, and it is huge advantage.

Reduction of the usage of cars will not only reduce Greenhouse gases but it will also help people conserve and save money and stay stress free. Limiting car usage will save you money a couple ways, one of which is not having to fuel up your car to save money. Fuel prices are always moving up and down, but more recently they have been very high. For many people they are spending over 50 dollars at the pump just to dirve 50 or so miles. With reduction of car usage people wont have to spend as much money at the pump. Reduction of car usage will also help reduce spending money because it wont allow to buy things at certain stores that you have to drive too, and things like that. Another advantage of the reduction of the usage of the car is the reduce in stress for a person. In town of Vauban, Heidrun Waltert said, ""When I had a car, i was always tense. Im much happier this way."" This way he mean the way without a car.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"It appears that the world has begun to go through a cultural shift. That is, a preference of not using a private mode of transportation to get to work, or the gym, or wherever else people need to go on a day-to-day basis. In fact this preference is very benificial in that it has begun to affect our lives. In limiting car usage citizens can help reduce pollution such as smog in their community, or even enhance their community by introducing the need for new sidewalks or markets within a walking distance of their homes.

It is of the utmost truth, cars create pollution. In fact they are ""one of the highest contributing factors of pollution, besides power plants in America.""(Rosenthal 34). Which of course is not very surprising since just about everybody has a car around the time that they recieve their licence. Cities like Paris sometimes have to ""...enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air...""(Duffer 10) ,this only seals in the idea that cars contribute to the amount of pollution in the air we breathe. Limiting the amount of car usage, will limit the pollution in the air. It is as simple as that. But if you limit the usage of cars it can become diffucult to get to places you need to go, fear not. Limiting car usage makes it a neccesity to have stores accesible to the public.

Walking or using public transportationto get to and from your local grocery or gym may be a bother, but, lately cities with a decrease in their car usage have made it more pleasant on the public. Cities like Bogota (Colombia) are witnessing this first hand. Since their city impliments a day without cars businesses and the city itself have begun to take notice in the large numbers that participate. The city is flourishing in the fact that ""parks and sports centers...have bloomed throughout the city; eneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced,...and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""(Selsky 28). In Vauban (Germany) cars use is limited, but the suburb itself has made tasks such as shopping easier in that "",...stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in mallks along some distant highway.""(Rosenthal 6). These advancements in the town are all thanks to the limiting of car usage.

All in all, limiting car usage is anything but harmful to our communties. Limiting usage helps reduce pollution in our air, and it also helps in that it aids in restoring our communities in the fact that sidewalks are being repaved or created, or even a grocery is withing walking distance. So if you have the choice whether to take your car to the market or walk, take the walk, your community might get something good out of it.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Many people feel that the president plays a very imperative role in the United States. He has much responsibility and an enormous influence on what this country stands for. So, surely, this president must be carefully sought out from the abundance of other candidates. It is quite contreversial as to what method is best for selecting them. Although an electoral college may appear as the right path, the countries interest unvariably lies with the popular vote because it is fair and unstressful unlike the electoral college.

Firstly, the electoral college is quite unfair. It is mentioned by Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" that some of the states do not even get to see candidates under the electoral college system. Candidates don't even bother with the states that they don't have a chance of winning over. They focus all of their attention on swings states. This means that some states have to vote based on just what they have heard. These people could have heard rumors and now are voting under false impressions. They deserve their own fair share of information from the candidates themselves. Also, under the electoral college the people of this nation aren't even voting for their president. They are voting for the electors. All that they can do is hope that the person that they voted for votes in their favor (Plumer). There is no guarentee that they will, so people have little say in who is president. This is their country, they should be able to decide who does and doesn't govern it. It is mentioned that with the popular vote larger states get more attention than little ones (Posner). The popular vote may not be entirely fair to all states, but it most definitely is better than the electoral college. Even Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO agree that the electoral college should be abolished.

As if this wasn't enough to get rid of the electoral system, the popular vote is also much less stressful. First off, the there could be a tie. If there is a tie, the decision goes to the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is likely that the result of their voting will not be at the will of the people (Plumer). Isn't it just easier to have their load lightened and take the stress of thep possibility off thier back? Although the outcome of a tie is unlikely (Posner) it is still possible and causing unnecessary stress. Additionally, the electoral college results in the presence of the disaster factor (Plumer). If a repeat of the 2000 fiasco (the biggest election crisis in the past hundred years (Plumer)) is what America is looking for then by all means choose to stick with the electoral college.

In summation, it is prominent that the most potent option for this naiton is to elect the president of the United States by popular vote. Even though the electoral college does have some pros, the ultimate candidate is the popular vote as it ensures fairness and a virtually stressless voting process. Who doesn't want that?",4,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The author supports his idea on studying Venus despite all the dangers and doubts, in a understandable way.

The author states facts from The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and pursuade in a detailed way of showing that humans can go and study Venus.

The author also states that Venus was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" which means that Venus was similar to Earth and closest to planetary visit.

On paragraph 5, the author states that we can have blimp like vehicle floating above Venus fray or 30 miles above Venus's landscape, which is 170 degrees fahrenheit.

The author claim there can be air planes and jets flying over the storms of Venus. The author also claimed that the radiation will not exceed earths level.

At the end of paragraph 5, the author states ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author claims all these facts on paragraph 5 from NASA.

On parahgraph 7, the author states that NASA is working on approaches to studying Venus with mechanical computers that only use gears and levers.

The mechanical computers would last longer than modern computers with silicon carbude.

The mechanical computers were tested in a chamber simulating the chaos od Venus's surface amd lasted three weeks.

The mechanical computers were used in 1800s and an important role in the 1940s World War II.

At the end of paragraph 7, the author states "" By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" which means that mechanical computers would be very important to studying Venus.

With these details and facts the author gave us, shows how the author was supporting his idea on studying Venus.

The author had facts from NASA and provided details on in a understandable way.

"The ¨Face"" on Mars is a mere coincidence. There are many formations like this one on earth. When using the Mars Global Survey spacecraft it´s high resolution camera picked up no signs of any type of advanced civilization. Authors of magazines at the time also hyped the ¨Face¨ up, to get more people interested in Mars. This story has been used in an array of entertainment, from movies to magazines.

On Earth there are formations called buttes, ¨ That´s a lava domes that take formation of an isolated mesa...¨ according to paragraph twelve. Also in paragraph twelve it states that on Earth these landforms are most common in the American west. These particular formations are especially common in the Cydonia region of Mars. Finding these landforms in this region are so common that the scientists at NASA were shocked at how much it resembled a face, knowing it was not an alien artifact. Another reason that we know it is a butte is because it was not only photographed once or twice but three times!

This landform has been photographed by two different spacecraft, the Viking 1 and the Mars Global Surveyor. These spacecraft were spread apart for a span of over 25 years! The Viking 1 picked up the best images it could for it´s time but the much more recent Mars Global Surveyor has a much better and more accurate image of the ¨Face¨ than the 1976 photo. The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) also took two clear photographs of the landform while the 1976 image is blurry to say the least. In 1976 the image was so fuzzy that no one could tell what was there, which led to reporters and authors to excite the public more than what was necessary.

In 1976 authors and reports hyped up the find of this ¨Face¨ on Mars. Authors did this to draw more attention to Mars, which because NASA serves the interests of the people and the government was an outstanding thing but it went to far. After all a face on a planet not all that far from us makes a great headline. Not everyone exaggerated it though NASA, as said in the article, upon releasing the pictures to the public stated ¨huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.¨ The face on Mars was also used in afilm and in countless magazines across the country.

The ¨Face"" on Mars is merely just shadows playing tricks on the eye. The Face is merely a landform with shadows in all the right spots playing an illusion on those who see it. Over the years many claims, false or true, have been made about the Face on Mars and they aren going to stop anytime soon. So far no evidence supports the claims of conspiracy theorists, however that doen´t mean they never will. The ¨Face¨ on Mars has had many stories told about for over two and a half decades, and they are not going to stop anytime soon, but it is important to know that science has not proven anything about the ¨Face¨ on Mars, yet.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"One of the planets in the solar system, Venus is one of most brightest points of light in the night sky. Sometimes it can be called the ""Evening Star"". Venus can be simple to see from the distant, but it can be challenging to examine more closely. The author who wrote this article about ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. There are reasons that Venus can be worthy but dangerous at the same time.

The planet Venus can be dangerous because, it can cause natural disasters in our environment. In paragraph 3, it states that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Another reason why Venus can be dangerous because, it has alot of heat. In the text it says, "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"".

Not only is our planet Venus can be dangerous, it can be very worthy too. In paragraph 5, it states that ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"".

In the text it states that, "" peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditons because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography inneffective"".

"Imagine a world where there were less accidents, less pollution, and faster transportation for everyone. This may sound too good to be true, however this just might be a reality in the near future. Many car manufacturers have been pushing to have autonomous care be developed and sold. While some people may not be convinced by these claims, autonomous cars are a stepping stone towards a safer world. The main reasons why these cars would be beneficial for our future are increased safety, less pollution, and faster transportation.

The first advantage is safety. Who doesn't want to live in a safer world? Autonomous cars can greatly incresase the safety of transportation. If we all got autonomous cars that were all programmed nearly the same, they would drive themselves in a safe way and less accidents would occur. For example, many deaths occur in the U.S. due to drunk driving or wreckless driving, however, with these autonomous cars we can prevent these factors from claiming lives.

Next, less pollution is a wonderfully positive characteristic of these cars. These autonomous cars use half of today's taxis. This would decrease the amount of fossil fuels being burned which will greatly decrease pollution caused by automobiles. If these autonomous cars were to be fuled by some other resourse that harms the environment little to not at all, pollution would drastically decrease. In the future cars may never cause pollution again. This would help us conserve our planet and insure that our children's children will live in a safe world.

Finally, the last reason why autonomous vehicles are a good idea is faster transportation. If someone were on a road trip,

on their way to an important meeting out of state, or if your just extreamly tired in the morning, autonomous cars can help. Human navigation is required in some situations, however it may not come up that often. If you ever get tired while driving for many hours, the autonomous cars can help take you to your destination. This insures faster transportation and increases safety. Many people have to drive for many hours a day, when these people start to get tired they slowly drift into sleep, this could cause many accidents. Autonomous cars can eliminate this problem immediatly and it will also increase the amount of time you drive so you can get to your destination faster.

Clearly autonomous cars are the way of the future. It may take a while for these cars to be developed, but the advantages are too great to over look. We can saves lives with the save autonomous technology the cars use to drive themselves. We can save our planet by creating less pollution and we can travel longer and faster. We should encourage car manufacturers to create these cars so we can life a better life.",3,3,1,3,1,2,2,1,2
"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has lots of useful information about the planet venus and it's difficulty to be explored as well as why it is worth exploring despite the danger.

Even though it is dangerous to explore Venus, the article does have some good points regarding why it is worth the risk to explore it. One example from the article is in paragraph 4 which reads, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". This excerpt helps show that Earth and Venus were quite similar at one point, making it important to explore and discover how both planets were similar, and if humans could live on Venus at some point, as well as many other unanswered questions.

Another good point that the author makes in paragraph 4 which reads, ""recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This part of the article helps show that there can be many practical uses for information discovered about Venus during these explorations even if there is danger involved when trying to explore.

Overall, the author has a strong argument for the benefits of exploring Venus outweighing the danger and difficulty",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3

"Facial Action Coding System

This passage explains how FACS could help for a lot of different things. For example in the article it says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."" Meaning that if the FACS really does work, it could be used for knowing how teenagers feel about school and learning. Teenagers now an days think school is boring. Sometimes teachers don't even know when their students are paying attention. If schools had emotion-recognition software we would be able to know if our students are into the lessons.

The FACS could help teachers understand how their students may feel. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In my opinion i think it is true, having a emotion-recognition software could really help teachers. Some kids are to nervous to ask the teacher to repeat the lesson, kids get confused easily, having a FACS could really help. It could let you know if your student is confused or bored. This could really change the way of teaching, some teachers don't even pay attention to their students.

Having a emotion-recognition software could really help all around the world. The creator tested the new software on the Mona Lisa painting. The results were incredible. He says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" It also says ""It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, the same technology can make computers animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery."" Having this software could really help people understand how others feel. This proves how technology could be very useful, this new generation is going to change the world, and so is this new FACS software.

Dr. Huang created the FACS to underdstand human facial expressions. I say that in my own words having a emtion-recognition software could really help people. Sometimes teenagers hide their emotions and put on a fake smile or pretend to be happy when they are not. Teenagers now an days don't really like showing their emotions because in their mind they think it makes them seem weak. Sometimes teenagers don't want to talk about what is wrong, and sometimes teachers/parents don't even know what to do. That technology could really change the world. In paragragh 6 Dr. Huang notes ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that, too."" That is true. Now that kids have iphones and computers , they could use emoji's to express how they feel.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"I think that having this new technology in the classrooms would be a good thing. Many people may not agree with me but new can be good. Also many kids may think that its a bad idea but trying different things in the classroom could help many kids out. And the teachers would love that. But even if its not good the teacher wouldn't have to keep using it. In the artcle the author says, ""Hold on! Can we actually ""calcuate"" emotions - like math homework? And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to espress how we feel?"" (D'Alto 2). Here the author makes a good point. Could this really would? How is it possible? Is it helpful? And there are many more quetions that I'm sure people have about it. But trying something new and seeing if technology like this could really be valuable is wroth trying out. Also this would be a good thing becasue kids would learn about art. The Mona Lisa is very famous and many people know about it. And learning more about it would be great thing for the kids in the classroom. I can see why many people wouldn't like it in thier classroom though. Maybe the teacher doesn't like art. Or maybe they don't know that much about art. But even if that's the reason for not trying this out I believe it would be good for the kids and they would learn something new and different. And that can be very imporant in the classroom and for the childen. At the end of the artile the author stats, ""By the way, did making a happy face in the experiment also mkae you feel slightly happy?"" (D'Alto 9). Using this technology can not only help the kids learn about the art behide it but could also help them learn more about themseleves. And to me and I'm sure to many teachers that is the most imporant thing of all.",2,2,1,1,0,1,1,2,1
"According to the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" This planet is worthy of the risks and issues of exploration. While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin."" As a way to persuade the reader into believing that Venus is worthy of its investigations.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that studying the planet Venus would be a rewarding endeavor. The author presents his claim and supports it very well through the knowledge he already has about the planet, the knowledge that the exploration of Venus might uncover, and persuasion through relating to his readers. This allows for the author to very clearly and precisely get his point across to those who might read the article. It also creates a strong way for the author to connect to his readers.

When the author uses the knowledge that he already has about Venus, he is trying to convey that what information we have on Venus is already important. In Paragraph 4, the author presents the idea that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". When the author introduces this concept, he also describes the surface of Venus to be ""rocky"" and ""includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"". Becuase the author presents the idea that Venus might have been like Earth and then goes on to describe this, he strongly supports his claim of how rewarding studying Venus could be. He is also trying to spark an interest in his readers regarding the study of Venus.

In Paragraph 6, the author suggests that researchers need to get closer to the ground.

When he says ""researchers cannot take samples...from a distance"", he is urging scientists to find ways to get closer to Venus's surface. To support this he also presents that scientists ""cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else"" without getting closer. He uses the curiousity of man to lure them into what he wants them to. This proves to be strong support for his main claim. This also leads right into the persuasion aspect of his support.

The author uses persuasion throughout the article, but in Paragraph 8 it is used excessively. Near the end of the paragraph, he introduces the idea that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". When he uses ""should not"" in that sentence, he is adding a strong opinion to his conclusion. In doing so, his opinion also contributes to the persuasion factor. This allows for him to call out to the reader individually and emotionally affect them. Using persuasion made way for the author to support his claim very well and influence the reader to think the same way as him.

Overall, the author has a very well thought-out way of supporting his claim that studying Venus would be a worthy persuit, despite the dangers. The author hits the brick wall head on by first presenting the knowledge he already has. This allows for the readers to have a little bit of foreground to play on. Then, he introduces the knowledge that could be gained by studying the planet, giving the readers a clear-cut example of how studying Venus might present important information. Finally, he includes persuasion, making it possible to influence the readers one by one. In conclusion, the author supports the claim, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents, very well.",4,4,4,4,2,3,3,4,3
"The Facial Action Coding System, I think is a great piece of technology to have in a classroom. The feedback you receive from this system can help the teachers enhance their teaching mechanics in the classroom to get the students to interact more. It can help the teachers see which teaching mechanics need changed or improved and it can help set future classes to become more motivating and exciting. I'm sure that this type of technology will be very useful in the future. This generation is relying on technology a lot and I think that this technology piece will be beneifial to learning in the years ahead of us.

Feedback from the Facial Action Coding System can be a great tool to teacher's mechanics or teaching habits in the classroom. This can be because this tool can detect more than a teacher can and also can produce more feedback then a regular teacher can, but don't get me wrong, teachers are wonderful. The text states,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that computers can be very helpful. Dr. Huang has done a marvelous job with this design.

Like I've said before the FACS can modify or help the teachers or lesson to become a more effective lesson to the students. The FACS can detect which muscles are being used in your facial expression and use that detection to make a more effective lesson for the students. The text states,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit."" The text also states,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. This explains that the FACS is very productive and is promising.

The FACS can improve the classes and the classrooms. It can also help set a better stage for teaching. This can produce ideas that people can bring to the classroom to seem more inviting and get more students that want to learn and can be excited while learning. The text shows that the FACS detects emotions that can be received by teachers and from there they can modify their teaching or better yet make the classroom and better and a enthusiatic place to learn. The FACS is very useful and detects emotions very well. The text also states,"" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona LIsa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This just shows how outstanding the FACS is and how useful it can become within schools throughout the world.

In conclusion I feel that the FACS can be very benificial in the classroom and this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Feedback from the FACS can enchance the teacher's ability to teach in a more exciting classroom. It can help the teachers see which teaching mechanics need changed or improved and it can help set future classes to become more motivating and exciting. These are reasons why I believe that further action in this department is more than neccassary for our classrooms. As a student myself, there are some classes that could use a little more excitement. This can improve the work ethic of students and maybe more students won't skip school, because school then w il be exciting and will be a better learning environment.",3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2

"Why would people use this type of technology to read students emotions and why is it valuable. I'll tell you why it's valuable. I'll also tell you if it's wrong to do this. I'll tell you if it's right to do this.

I think this type of technology is great to read students facial expressions. Because if a student is feeling sad and the school didn't know the school can help that kid if there is something wrong. They could figure out weather that kid is always bored in a certain class so maybe the teacher can make the class funner. They can use this technology to see if a kid is angry in a certain class and that the school can ask why the student gets so angry in that class like is he getting bullied or he just hates the class. Im all for this technology i think it's really cool.

But there are also the negatives to this technology. Lets say a student dosent want anyone to watch him when he's trying to do work or when he's at home doing stuff. Students don't want their privacy invaded. If students don't want people to know what feelings they are going thorugh then maybe they should'nt do this.

That is my opinion on this new technology. I don't know if it's wrong to do this or if it's the right thing to do. I think they should take a vote if students want this or not.",2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Luke's particapation in the seagoing cowboys program allowed him to experience adventure and visit many unique places. luke visited very unique places like China,Italy,Europe, and even Greece. In the text it says that luke knew it was the oppertunity of a lifetime. This evidence proves that in the program seagoing cowboys Luke was visiting many unique places. In conclusion, people like Luke can help change the world and have fun while doing it.

Luke joined the program because he wanted to help other countries recover there food supply and animals. i know this because the text says he cared for animals which is what kept him busy. This evidence proves that luke is very caring. The text also states that he slipped down the ladder and broke his rids. This evidence proves that he was still caring even though he cracked his rib because he still was helping feed them and help them as much as he could. One of the last reasons why that seagoing cowboys place allowed him to visit unique places is because he got to go to China ,Greece,Italy, and Europe. How many people do you know that can do that on a daily basis. In conclusion,luke is a very hardworking person and he deserves whatever comes to him.

"intro: Today ill be telling you the pros and cons about having this technology in our schools from counslers being able to tell whats with the student to invading the privacy of what we humans have to preventng suicide and to be able to maybe stop someone from commiting suicide or knowing someone is going through depression.

body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up, but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed.

conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology.",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0
"Students may have probelms and can be mad or sad in sometimes but some people don't like when someone comes to them and start asking then about how they feel, some studens could prefer woek on their problemas by themselves.

First of all, using a system that shows how you fell could be a little bit too far, it's ok to care about other but knowing how they fell could disrespect their privacy ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", what about is sad because he is having family problems? it would be rude to ask him why are you feeling sad in front of a class.

People actually feel bad a lot of times, and some people don't like others to stay on their bussiness. I would be really wierd to see how someone feel wtith helpa from a compute, if you are trying to help somebody, it not honest to know how someone else feels with a computer system, if you really care about someone, whn you are about someone, you should ask them how they feel and if they don't anything is because he don't want other people to knwo about it, people shoul respects the other's feelings.

Using a system that shows how someone feels in students is disrespectful, because you are not respecting their privacy, they should never use those systems at school. -",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,2,0
"You should join this program called the UNRRA or the United Nations Relief and Rehabiliation Administration. This program goes over seas to go and help people rebuild there country that was destroyed by the WW2 war. If you like animals and traveling to new plaes this is the place to join.

"When one thinks of transportation, the first idea that springs into a persons mind would be a car. A car is used almost daily for many people. It helps us get to point A to point B rain or shine. However, complications arise from the use (or overuse) of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage includes reduction in pollution, promote public transport, and cut off traffic.

Pollution has become a growing problem as the world continues to industrialize. The greenhouse gases emitted by machines, such as cars, have been proven detrimental to the enviornment. In car-dense citites, smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, has become a nuisance as it covers cities. In extreme cases,it makes the air citizens breathe toxic! According to Source 1, "" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". To establish limits to car usage would then, therefore, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and clear up conditions not only for the world, but make the over-all city more enjoyable to live in. In order to reduce pollution and clear the air, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the international city. Source 2 states that "" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescing the ban..."" proving that limiting car usage benefitted the city and the enviornment as well.

Reduction of car usage would lead to the promotion of public transportation. Public transport was free of charge during the ban in Paris which stated was a success in reducing pollution. Limiting car usage would then correlate in the promotion of public transport which, according to Source 4, ""...public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions [of greenhouse gases] and improve safety""  This not only benefits one's safety and environment but allows time-efficient traveling as buses and other public transport run along a contiuous schedule. Public transport also produces carpooling, which allows the reduction of cars on the road. This also eliminates a distributor in the production of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which benefits the world.

Limiting car usage will take one annoying factor from our daily lives-- traffic. As a suburban citizen living in Florida, traffic has become a daily nuisance of mine, one that not only is frusterating but stressful. It wastes time that I need to invest in being somewhere of importance. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars in their experimental new district near the French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Paris, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog..."" during their ban in response to reduce pollution. This would make the lives of many citizens much more happier and time efficient as there are no worries about arrving late to an area of importance!

Limiting car usage in many large cities accross the globe is not impossible, it has been done successfully in globally impactful cities such as Paris. This reduction of cars will not only benefit a community or a city, but the whole world! It will reduce pollution, promote the usage of public transport and carpooling and cut down on the rush-hour traffic leaving condtions in cities much more enjoyable to live in.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"How many different emotions have you ever felt in your life? You cannot possibly know and remember every feeling you've ever had. Using the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and an amazing thing that has been developed, however, there is no way it is accurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look.

Though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. Some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. Some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. The text states ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. There are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples.

All people feel different emotions in their life. They can also feel multiple emotions at one time. Saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. People have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. Technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. The passage says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" It is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. This would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate.

Acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. People do this almost on a daily basis. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. Unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. This adds to the previous reason of why the Facial Action Coding System would be inaccurate.

The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look. In conclusion, this system could be highly inaccurate and ineffective. Perhaps sometime in the future, when technology is much more developed, this system may work a little better, but it will still take many years to perfect the Facial Action Coding System.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Venus is a well-known or maybe to some well - heard of planet in our solar system. It's also known as the ""Evening Star."" NASA has a ""particularly compelling idea"", for sending humans to study Venus, as the reader may notice from the text. We are told that Venus may have some interesting things being discovered that may lead to new studies. It's dangerous and takes caution, but is it worth it?

As the reader can tell from the text, the author states mutliple reasonings for why it would be worth it for humans to do such studies on Venus. One of those might be for the fact that Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin."" This is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth within being of terms in density and size. Plus, it's super close to Earth so it's one of Earth's closest ""neighbors."" It's found within the text also that Venus may have contained bodies of water such as Oceans and who knows, maybe lakes here and there. Due to the planets' surface of rocky sediment, it's possible that there were familiar features sich as valleys, mountains, and craters. It is said that maybe once there has been or maybe still is some form of life on our neighboring planet.

Another thing that ties into why it would be worth the study is that what if we could send humans to maybe live on Venus? It's definitely a work in progress due to temperatures going to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

Surviving human lives on Venus wouldn't be easy due to these conditions but that is why NASA is digging deeper into what can be done to make it suitable for human lives. Though one other thing shared with the reader is that the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, which is a holdback but it's of course possible for adaptation in the right conditions which need to be discovered. If it's possible that other forms of life lived on Venus then why not humans too?

The third reason for studying Venus being worthy is that human curiosity can lead to an endorsement of new ideas. Of course that is why NASA is such a thing. The way our bodies work have been in discovery for years and years. Which leads to the idea that if we can figure out how and why our bodies function in certain conditons on Earth, how could and would our bodies function on a planet that is closest to features alike the sun.

These reasons explain to the reader why the author might believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers; because, who else is to make these discoveries and what if NASA were to find information that could help us learn a bit more about our own planet. Plus, more about the human life can be something that we learn more and more about. And lastly, who's to say that curoisity killed the cat? Well of course it's everyone; but, with new studies and leads we can figure out how curiosity saved the ""cat"" and taught that ""cat"" new things.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
"When looking at the Facial Action Coding System and seeing what it did for this peinting, I think it would be a great idea to use in the classrooms to reqd the students emotional expressions. Dr. Haung observes that many artists likr da Vinci did, and he relized that tney studied human anatomy, this is how they were abel to paint facilmuscles precisely. Dr. Haung relized that by haveing a machine like this one, doctors would be abel to performe better surgery by useing video surgery and or better graphics for video games, beter quality images of human faces and better muscel pictures would become a huge hit in the medical field.

Dr. Eckman and Dr. Haung were both abel to figure out that if you raise your lips at the corner of your mouth, squint your eyes slightly, and raise the outer parts of your cheeks toward your eyes, your lab partner would be clueless on what emotion you were performing. These are the instructions on how to look happy says Dr. Haung. The Facial Action Coding System can even detect when you are forcing a fake smile instead of a real simle.

This is why I feel that putting the Facial Action Coding System into schools acros the globe would be a good thing. Not only would this give the schools feed back on how their students mental state changes throughout the day, but also this machine would help detect early signs of depression and posibly signs of bullying. When students tell teachers they are not getting bullied or hurassed, the Facial Action System might be abel to detect when a student is lying an d or not wanting to share all of the details in his or her life.

These are all the reasons I personally think the Facial Action Coding System should be placed in schools everywhere. People were interested in the face and how the mucels work even whe da Vinci was alive all the way to today when we are atill intdrested in how the fave and muscels not only work, but how they can be minipulated and how each emotion brings on different muscels.",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"One day while i was at my job working for NASA, I heard a door open. I turned to look, and in walked a conspiracy theorist, knuckles dragging the ground, dead eyes staring, and drool escaping from his open mouth. ""May I help you, sir?""

""Yeah! I know there's a face on Mars and i want you scientists to stop hiding the evidence!""

Here we go again I thought. I had seen thousands of people like him, asking the exact same thing. and every time my reply was the same: There is no face on Mars. The appearance of the face is caused by shadows on a mesa.

However they never believe me. ""Those pictures are faked so that you can hide the evidence!""

I always give them the standard reply that the pictures are official and that is that.

One thing I as a scientist don't understand about these people is why they think an alien civilization would build a giant replica of a HUMAN face. Theres no way they'd even know we existed, so why bother?

In conclusion conspiracy theorists are going to believe there is a face on Mars no matter how much evidence we give them to the contrary, so why even bother trying.",1,3,0,2,1,2,2,1,2
"Wow! Did you know that Venus have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system? It was the second planet from our sun. Venus is very similar to earth. it was often called earth's rwin. It was one of the brighest points of light in the night sky. Scienctist tried to study Venus but they could not because they don't have devices that can stay longer than a week on Venus. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Next, Venus is very similar to Earth. The Venus was often called Earth's twin because if you look at the Venus the color was blue and they believed taht Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the distance are closest too. Just like in earth the Venus has a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It was our nearest option for a planetary visit. It was one of their challenge to get to Venus and study about it. ""The Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Second, photography and videography, and researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, Scienctist tried to study the Venus but they couldn't because they don't have any techonology that can be sent to Venus. Sometime they thought that sending people to Venus but since it was dangerous. They made electronics made of silicon carbide and they tested it. At first, it was work but it only last for onw week. Now, they are looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. This devices doesn't electronics it was faster, faster, and flexible. This deviced were used in the 1800s to 1940s during World War ll. Sometime, when it is very hot other mental things are meling but this devices can ne made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, the author suggests taht studing Venus is a wothry persuit despite the dangers it presents. I also think that it was worth to study even it is dangerous because this is so fanastining and very intersecting. Venus is very similar to earth and it will be very cool if we could learn about it. In the reading says"" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" It means that there are many other things in other planet no matter how dangerous it is we should be seek to it. The author talk more about positive than negative about Venus. Even when the author is talking about bad things but they always end in nice way.

In conclution, Venus was very similar to Earth. Scienctist tried to study Venus for a long time but they could not sucesses because they are lack of devices and the author suggests that studying Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They have tried several time but they coud not sucesses. I hope that that they will be sucesses this time and if they are sucesses it will give us a lot of knowledege. We already been to Moon so I think they will find out how to get onto Venus. Even if they can not achieve in this generation. I think they will be achieve in the nect generation because technology kept improving each day.",3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The author of this text support the idea of studying Venus even knowing the danger, as he explains and describe Venus, he list reasons why we should study more about this curious planet.

In the majority of the paragraphs he list reasons of the importance of studying Venus also talks about the dangers and risks of this planet, like the temperature, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in the Solar System"".

A big idea he added to his text is the similarities that Venus has or used to have compare to the earth, such as oceans that were a while ago, mountains, volcanoes, ""Long ago, Venus had oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"". People sometimes refers to Venus as the Earth's twin.

Knowing all the risks that Venus present, NASA has ideas to send humans to study this planet. NASA's ideas are creating an blimp-like vehicle that would fly obove Venusian landscape and avoid hard conditions from the landscape and make to survive storms... Also it will be colder but still hot, around 170 degrees.

The author explains very good why we should go ahead and study Venus, even knowing the risks, we have the knowledge to solve these issues and it will be a big setp forward for humanity.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The idea of an autonomous car is very interesting but it should not be developed into an actual product. Though there are a few luxuries that come with an autonomous car there are quite a few more liabilities that come with it. The following are just some of the issues that could come up with the driverless car.

The first issue that could come about with these driverless cars is their reliance on absolute perfect conditions. The cars that they have tested needed to be put on a special test course to be used. These roads were nearly perfect roads unlike the roads that we drive on every day. To make this car street legal they would have to make major upgrades to the current roads and that would be way too expensive for the government to do. This is just too expensive to be a feasible idea.

The next issue that may possibly occur is legal disputes. If a car is not being controlled by the human inside of it and it crashes in to another car who is at fault for the wreck? That question will lead into a lot of legal disputes involving the cars if the technology fails. There will be owners who blame the manufacturer for the wreck because they made the technology that failed. They could also blame the driver in the car because they were not paying enough attention to take control of the car and prevent the accident from happening.

The third and final issue is the fact that the cars are not truly driverless. These cars are advertised as self driving cars but in reality they still require a driver. This will problems because if the technology fails and does not alert the driver when they need to to control of the car it could lead to accidents and possibly even deaths. Even if the technology does not fail the slightest of delays when sending a warning that they need to take control of the car could result in an accident or maybe even death. This ties in with the previous point about the legal liabilities that come with the driverless cars.

Overall the autonomous cars are a fascinating idea and one that many people may support but in reality they are a legal liability and they would cost a lot of money and possibly cause accidents or even deaths due to a failure or delay in the cars system that lets the driver know when to take control of the car.",3,4,1,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.",5,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Are driverless cars good or bad? Reliable or unproductable? Can they benifit us in the future? Or will it cause danger?.

For many years scientists have tested cars that can make driving alot easier for us in the near future. I honestly think driverless cars are an unproductable invention and can cause danger. It seems to me that it may or will cause alot more accidents than texting while driving or drinking while driving. For example, say if there are driverless cars in the future, and you or a group of friends are going on a road trip. The car is on auto pilot and you are drinking or texting, reading, listening to music, and/or perhaps sleeping. The car may not signal or warn you that their is traffic, or on road construction uphead. The car may cause you to get in trouble for not paying attention and taking control when neccassary, and/or may cause a horrbile accident. This can and will cause conflict between you and the manufacturer. This can cause a huge debate on driverless cars ; are they dependent and reliable enough or are self service cars safer?.

Driverless cars may indeed help those who are in need of going from one place to another such as senior citizens, legally blind, etc. But it may also put them in danger without them knowing. Another example, if you are a handicap, legally blind, or deaf, you may be in grave danger. The car again is on autopilot and is driving through a neighborhood and there are signs everywhere to when and where to stop, if there is construction, or there are people crossing the streets. You come to a stop at a stop sign, you are not paying attention, you are oblivious to your surroundings when doing other things. The car will go head but there is a car coming from the other side of the street where there is no stop sign. You and the other person collide. Now remember, the car is supposed to be an upgrade, advanced in technology. The car has sensors to sense if there is danger but the car may have a flaw. This again will bring conflict and debate. This can lead people to believe that driverless cars are unsafe and unproductive and is a liabilty. But say you were paying attention to your surroundings, instictively, you would look left and right. The car will go foward but, there is a car coming from the other side (remember there is no stop sign for the other car to stop at) you and that person collide. Again, the car is to have warned you but if you were alert, you would have taken control of the car when driving through a neighborhood.

Either way to me, driverless cars are dangerous no matter what. There not industructible and cannot always be depended on. They may be smart and advance but even the greatest technology can be a danger and liability.",3,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The ways we know that the face is just a natural land form and not something created by Aliens is because we have done real research on the Landform. Not only that but when we took the pictures we used our cameras absolute maximum resolution so it would be as clear as possible. Plus the evidence has changed. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and thats how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens. Plus we have a Surveyor which is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. The number one way we know it is a land form and not something created by Aliens is because As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!. Also we have pictures from 1976, 1998, and 2001 that shows its change and that it's a landform.",1,3,2,1,1,1,1,1,1
"In this article author argued about to use the auto drive system or not. Some people says it is dangerous but some people is not.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can druve themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us but we grow closer to the destination every day.Antilock brakes and driver assistance still seem a long way from the dream of calling a driverless can to take us wherever we desire, but Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream. ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensor were not there, the computers were not there, and the mappuing was not there. Radar was a device on a hilitop that cost two hundred miliion dollars. It was not something you could buy at radio shake So just how driverless will the cars be in the near future? Sensers are nothing new, of course. In the 1950's automakers used speed sensors at the whells in the creation of antilock brakes Within 10 years, Those sensprs had become more advanxced to detect and respong to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheel and reduce power from the engine allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone Fuyrther improvemenrts in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more druvung takse on theri own.

"Dear Senator,

My name is PROPER_NAME from LOCATION_NAME. I wanted to adress the positivity in keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote. Every state is important because everyone's a president. Also, there are swing states which is a winner-takes-all method.

The Electoral College has a small chance of winning with a Electoral College vote than a popular vote. Although in 2000 the Electoral College vote happened it is very unlikely to occur. Reason is that the Electoral College exceeds the share of the popular vote. Even a slight chance of a state plurality could cause a landslide electoral-vote-victory.

In the Electoral College no region has enough Electoral votes to elect a president. This means that a region needs to influence another to have atleast a elected president. For example, Romney was a solid regional(South) which means he focused in one region not the others, concluding his lost. So, it was very likely that Romney would not win because of his appeal to one region.

In the winner-takes-all method in the Electoral College induces the candidates. This was seen in 2012's election. The ost thoughtful voteers would have to decide the election, making Electoral College very fair.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Autonomous cars seem like they would never happen, but our world is changing and they are just around the corner. Autonomous cars are cars that are driven by a computer and not a human. Although, a driver can still take control when needed. The computers know know to drive and when to stop or go. In the article it states that the autonomous cars will use half the fuel of today's taxis and they are more flexible than a bus. The new cars though are not in total control, the drivers still can drive. I do not think that the driverless are a good idea and they should not be developed. They are dangerous, very expensive, and making our world more lazy.

To begin the driverless cars are extremely dangerous. Some people will have the driverless cars and some will be normal. The driverless cars let the driver take over if needed. The seats will vibrate, the voice control will come on, or any way to get the drivers attention; according to the article. What if the driver fell asleep and is a very hard sleeper. The cars might not be able to wake him or her up in time. Then, resulting in a crash or even more tragic. I think that the cars that are not driven by a computer are in danger. The driverless car will know when to stop and go at a stop light, but what if another car goes on accident and they did not mean to. It could be a pile up and a mess. The cars are just not safe enough for me to think that they should be developed.

Another reason I do not approve of driverless cars are that they are expensive. Yes, they do get better gas millage, but the cost of the cars to begin with is going to be outrageous. Somepeople and companies are not going to be able to afford the cars. The cars savings on gas will never compare to the crazy cost of them to begin with.

It states in the article that the upgrades to existing roads will be simply too expensive to be practical. I agree with this statement completely that the money will not be practical. The cars do have more flexible schedules than busses, but i would rather ride a bus than a very expensive car. There is a possibility of it getting into a crash and then you would have to get it fixed with even more bills. The car is just too expensive and crazy.

Lastly, the car in my opinion is lazy. The world today would rather have someone else care for them and for them to just relax. Yes, relaxing is nice, but you have to know what work is. The car is just another way for the world to be lazy. Driving is not that hard on your body, it is moving your feet and paying attention. The car just allows the world to have another way to be lazy. I think that it is good for your body to pay atttention and keep your eyes on the road. It makes you not drift off and think about what you are doing. The people that will have to take control after the car can't go through crashes or traffic will not be on their top watch. They probably will be sleepy or not paying attention. I just don't like to think of another way for society to have a reason to be lazy.

In conclusion, I do not agree with the development of driverless cars. They are dangerous, cost a lot of money, and they are a way for people to be more lazy. They will not benefit our society in any way. People have more control over a car than a computer. The money that people don't have should be used on food not cars. Somepeople are having a hard time providing for their family let alone having a car payment too. Also society is lazy enough without these driverless cars. The development of autonomous cars should not happen because the cars are never going to benefit society.",3,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"I believe that the face of Mars is just a natural landform because there is no such thing as aliens living upon us. Another reason is that Mars could've got hit by an astroid that came from the Astroid Belt, or maybe could've had a volcanic eruption. I know this because in the passage from the article it said, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural land form.""

Another passage form the article says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" I believe that Mars had signs of life, and water in the passed, but now Mars has changed and is still changing over time. Mars does not have water anymore, but theories show thats there might some signs of living on Mars. And that is why I believe that the image of the face on Mars is just a natural landform!!!",1,3,3,2,1,2,1,1,2
"Us humans live in this solar system with a handful of planets. We have Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, to name a few. All of these planets can have huge scientific discoveries waiting to be revealed to the known world. Especially one planet, Venus. Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin because it is the most relevant planet within Earth's dimensions. Scientist even say it could well be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. It was most likely covered in oceans and many various forms of life, like Earth.

We should really start pushing exploration into Venus. It is a dangerous mission as no human, with today's technology, can surive the severe climate of Venus. The surface is at average 800 degree's and would burn anyone to a crisp, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth.Even the atmosphere could kill you, with it being almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide!Even some of the spacecrafts couldn't survive the toxic,deadly atmosphere for a few hours.These conditions wouldn't make it plausible to even decide to investigate the planet,but is it worth investigating?

Venus is worth investigating because its the most similar planet to Earth. We could easily find remains of life forms and push scientic advancments through the roof. It'll help push technological advancments to find even more efficent and safer way to explore other planets. We need to push these boundaries that have been limited on us from the start. Human curiosity will lead to many projects to prolong our lives and to give us humans even more answers to the mystery of the world! We are having revolutinary inventions break through to help us with these types of adventures, NASA have made large advancments with simplifed electronics of silicon carbide that could last three weeks in those types of conditions as the author stated. With these types of electronics we could capture a captivating amount of evidence of life forms, and maybe even find forms of life living in these conditions.

With human curosity blasting with adrenaline, humans will push to do anything. We will sooner or later find a way to explore these types of avenues to make groundbreaking discoveries. With an exploration to Venus we could find large amounts of information that could help us even find ways to travel to other planets. There are many planets in the solar system that have many mysteries like the clouds of Jupiter,and with the striving mentality of us humans, we will pursue til the day we die. Human curosity will overcome any form of doubt because of the outcomes of these events. Humans defintely need to start pursuing avenues to explore the secrets of Venus, for the sake of humanities curosity.

In conclusion, we should investigate Venus. It portrays Earth, and has many similar qualities to Earth. It could be a sham but it could be a massive discovery for technology and for information. With intellect like ours, we will soon push past the boundaries and find the information we strive for.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"The aritcle "" Driverless Cars Are Coming "" talks about negative and positive asapects of driverless cars. I agree with the development of these cars because they help people out, they're smart cars, and people would be saving there money by not having to buy another car. All of these are good ideas to have driverless cars in the near future.

These new cars can be a big help to many people in genreal. If a person doesn't want to drive and is to lazy too, then that is what the cars are here for. Drivers can rest while the car is taking the wheel, but they would have to be in alert because there might be situatuons where there is work zones and would have to use our human skills to go around it. These cars can also warn drivers about certain things, such as pulling out of a driveway and making the driver look back and check if there are any cars.

These new and developed cars are also smart and can warn a driver with anything. Manufactures plan on using cameras to wtahc the driver have there eyes on the road and nowhere else. This would be a good idea because many people use there phone while driving. Either they are texting or talking to someone on the phone which is dangerous. This idea about using cameras to see if drivers are paying attention on the road would decrease the number of accidents and deaths. A good idea that they also came up with is to use flashing lights on the windshield to give the driver a heads up that it's there turn to take over the wheel which I feel is a good idea because if they're asleep then the flashing lights can wake them up instantly.

Another reason to get the driverless cars in the future is that a lot of people can't afford cars and they're stuck walking or riding there bike to school or to work. You won't have to buy a car anymore because of the new technology that they are coming up with. This will save people that are in need of a car a lot of money. This new technology would help out alot because of the different ideas that manufacutrers are coming up with.

I agree with the development of these cars because they help people out, they're smart cars, and people would be saving there money by not having to buy another car. These ideas would help and please a lot of people because it's so much help.",3,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear Florida Senator,

The ongoing debate of whether or not the Electoral College process is fair or unjust is always around you, I presume. I would like to give some personal feedback in the matters of this situation.

I understand that the Electoral College was created in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. (Source 1) However it is not a fair or even equal compromise. The people hardly have any political voice in this aspect. The electors that in return vote for the people generally aren't chosen by the people, the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party. (Some state laws vary) (Source 1) If you faithfully are going to vote for the Presidential candidate of your choice, you should be able to have faith in your vote. Those in favor of the Electoral College could make the remark that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...""(Source 3) In the world of reality people don't just want make a comment and expect no reaction, people want to be heard. This is similar to voting, people want their vote to count toward the candidate of their choice not the electors for the candidate.

This then runs into the problem of unfaithful electors. Their votes are never for sure. Although they claim to have ""trust that is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3) you can never be a hundred percent sure in the electors. ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Source 2) If this happens the popular vote actually wouldn't go to the thought candidate.

""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" (Source 2) In a case of a tie the vote would go to the House of Representatives. This means that each state would only be able to cast one vote. This is not a smart backup plan. It is not fair for states of different population sizes to have one vote- basically being categorized as one. Proportionally it is not right for a state who represents 500,000 such as Wyoming to recieve the same number of equally weighted votes as a state who represents 35 million such as California. (Source 2)

The Electoral College also follows the ""Winner-take-all"" method. This means that most in most elections the focus is on the swing states or toss up states, all the efforts go to these states. Even though ""the voters are most likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"", as said by those who believe in the Electoral College (Source 3) what about the voters who have been faithful all along? How can you expect them to feel when they barely get noticed? Those are the ones the candidates should be thanking and having gratitute toward because they are the ones who will be supporting them and their campaign.

I know that politics are filled with misconceptions and many confusing roles and aspects but please consider my thoughts and words. I speak for the voiceless and my fellow neighbors, but most importantly I speak for what our government was founded upon, WE THE PEOPLE.

Sincerely,

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does a good job of portraying how Venus is worth being studied despite its dangers. They talk about the different dangers in studying Venus, and they also talk about why it is so interesting and why it would be worth studying further.

The author shows this through the text because they clearly state why Venus is considered so dangerous and also why it is so interesting. For example, in paragprah 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid...temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit...atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These are some examples of the dangers that are presented when trying to study Venus. Despite the dangers, Venus would be worth looking into because it provides new information and a greater knowledge of what environments are like on other planets, for example, in paragraph 4, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These are some examples of why we should look more into Venus because it has similar features to Earth and it is interesting to figure out why or how they are similar. The author proves their point by explaining that these dangers could potentially be worked around. In paragraph 7, ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" This is showing that while Venus may be very dangerous to observe, there are advanced technologies out there that can lower the risk that comes with studying this planet. As the author stated in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagaination and innovation."" What the author is trying to get across in this line, is that we should not limit ourselves or limit how much we can know or see solely based on something being too dangerous, when there are innovations out there to make it possible.

These are some of the examples of how the author demonstrates his ideas on why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it presents. The author did a good job presenting his ideas, as shown in the text and examples provided.",3,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"I think driverless car are cool and should be a thing in the future, because it will be better for the environment, people will no longer get lost, accidents on the road will be a thing in the past.

The first reason to why I think diverless cars should be a thing is, it will be a lot better for the environment. In the article it said the driverless car will use half of the fuel the cars we have now. With todays technology we already have cars that use less fuel so think of how much less fuel the driverless car will use.

Second reason is people will no longer get lost. People always have trouble getting to place to place they don't how to get to, and always end up lost. well that situation will be solved when driverless cars are a thing, because all you really have to do is sit in the car and relax, and the

GPS will do the rest of the work for you.

Last but not least, accidents probably won't be a thing after diverless cars are a thing. Humans are not perfect and will make a lot of mistakes. Computers are a lot better than us at not making mistakes and probably better at avoiding them as well. So why not just let the sensors on the cars do its thing and just sit back and relax.

So as you can tell i really want driverless cars to be a thing in the near future. so we can, use less fuel and save the environment, not have to worry about getting lost, and finally to never get into accidents.",2,3,1,3,1,1,1,1,2

If "" hostile conditions on surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray.""

"What is Venus? Venus is a planet that is the second planet from our sun. The author wants us to explore Venus to make it our second home even though there are some risks that can harm us humans and any other life form on that planet. It will also become expensive to study Venus.

With expolring Venus and humans possibly exploring there it won't be such a good idea because it can cause those peopl to die. In the text it states ""On the planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the amospheric pressure is 90 timess greater than what we experience on our own planet.""Paragraph 3 second sentence.

By stating this in the text he wants us to know a possible solution to explore Venus. A mechanical computer hasn't been used in almost a decade. How can they possibly find how to make these computers again. They probably will make them over and over again that wil recuire more money and by the time they actually get it rioght to explorre

Venus someone could posssible already found a solution for it to happen.

With this being said the author really doesn't give us a view on why we should explore Venus. By giving us possible outcomes such as building the mechanical computer and sending people to Venus. Those don't really help because they don't give us a better explanation to what will happen if we ddo become succesful with them.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars may be modern and use half of what todays taxis use . Yet they are not truly driverless, they still alert the driver to take over in certain conditions , for example pulling in and out of drive ways or driving through road work or accidents. Which brought them to the idea of embedding streets with an electrical cable that sends radio signals to a reciever on the front and end of the car , which is stated in the passage. These smart road systems worked well but require massive upgrades to existiing roads , which is simply too expensive. So with out the smart roads a whole lot of sensors are needed on the car , one specific sensor is the special touch sensor which makes sure that the driver keeps their hands on the wheel at all times . Besides that there is also seats that viberate to alert the driver and flashing lights on the window shields , which would add on to the price of a car. Also stated in the passage that so far none of the cars are completely driverless. They can steer , accelerate and brake themselves but they still notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills . This means the human driver must be alert and ready to take over at all time. Which might not always happen , a driver may not always be attentive of the road ahead even with alerts included in the car. Which brings up the case of a drivers, passengers , and pedestrians saftey , and lawmakers know that saftey is best achieved with alert drivers , which is stated in the passage. Traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. Infering to why in most states it is illegal even to test computer driven cars. Yet even if traffic laws change , new laws willl be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If an accident were to occur due to the technology failing , who is to blame the driver or the manufacturer.",0,3,3,2,0,1,0,2,0
"The face was not created by aliens on mars. The things that make it appear as a face are the shadows and the quality of which the picture was taken. The Face is just a rock formation, the fact that the shadows make it look like a face is simply just a coincidence.

If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The passage also says ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Key word, illusion.

The original picture shown in the passage wasn't taken at a very high quality. The passage states ""And so on April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web servers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This paragraph clarifies that the low quality original picture, along with the shadows, is what made it appear as a face. The Face is just a rock formation that looks like a face, nothing more than that.

All in all, the Face was not made by aliens and it is just a rock formation with a cool looking shadow. Though these alien theories are fun to believe in, the alien theory of this case is false.",2,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,4
"In this story A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,I go on a trip with my friend to Europe and get a once in a life time opportunity, to be a Seagoing Cowboy. In this essay I will be covincing you to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program. I will talk about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and get to have fun but also help your country.

First off, seeing the world. in the story I talked about how besides helping people I got to see the breath taking view of Europe and China but seeing the Acropolis in Greece was just beautiful. I also traveled across the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United States. Now who wouldn't want to see the world like I did and still help people in need?

Next, site seeing. On my journey to help, I got to take a gondola ( a boat) ride in Venice, Italy a city with sreets of water. Wouldn't it be amazing to go on a gondola and to go explore Italy? Also,I toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. Is'nt that just amazing?

Last but not least, what is a Seagoing Cowboy? I can't persuade you to be one if I don't tell you what it is! A Seagoing Cowboy takes care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas . Don and I signed up. When we were Seagoing Cowboys it was 1945 when World War 2 was over in Europe. We helped countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more. If you like helping people this would be a great job for you.

In conclusion, I hope I convinced you to be a Seagoing Cowboy. Now that I've told you about how you get to see the world, go site seeing, and what a Seagoing Cowboy is I hope I've helped you make up your mind. In the future, I hope more people will sign up and help better our would.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Even though, driverless cars seem to be easier and better than a self driving car, they have possible negative outcomes. Some people would get a driverless car because of lazyness or not wanting to driving. A driverless car could have good and bad outcomes. ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driverways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" Whether the driver wants to drive or not they still would have to stay aware and watch the road at all times.

There are many reasons some people wouldn't get a driverless car.Driverless cars are created to further lazyness. People would start texting and being on the phone as the driverless car drive. That can still cause an accident, technology have issues and powerdowns often. You can't depend on technology for everything. The main reason some wouldn't buy the driverless car is because of safety reasons. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" People feel as if anything can happen and go wrong dealing with a driverless car. It's as if you are risking your life for a free ride with no safety guarantees. Another reason some may turn down a driverless car is because they are expensive. ""The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary codes. These smart road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Theseare just the main issues dealing with an driverless car.

On the otherhand, some may think a driverless car is way better than a regular car. Only because they don't really have to do anything. They can relax in the driver seat and cruise around. It's nothing wrong with having relax time while your car drive you itself. They are still developing new safety ideas for the driverless car. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the roas, the car watches the driver."" These ideas will insure safety to the people. Aslong, as the driver stay alert while the driverless car is driving everything should go well. People have their different reasons on why they should and shouldn't buy a driverless car, but even with a regular car you can still have accidents. To be on the safe side, always pay attention to the road for your own safety.",3,1,3,2,0,1,1,1,1
"INTRODUCTION: A brand new software has been developed. This software improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others; This new software has promising applications for a variety of industries.

Imagine a computer can tell how you're feeling just from your face, like for example you go to a computer and ask her how am I feeling today, then the computer will say= 83%happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, 2%angry; And you'll be like WHAT?, how can a simple computer make such a thing?.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, with 44 major muscles this is called ""action unit"".

Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)

BODY: Dr. Huang observes that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal and humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day; How?: you can probably tell how is your friend feeling just looking at him or hearing his voice.

This software could change the whole world; For example imagine you are in the ethernet and then a web ad player pop's up, if you smile at it a similar ad might follow; But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts.

CONCLUSION: Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also can help produce them; we unconsciously imitate person's facial expressions. So in conclusion I would say that we can start using this magnificient software and his technology to read student's emotional expressions because it could also help teacher's to see how their student's are doing and if someone is distracted or bored the computer will notice the teacher so he/she can move on into another thing or go talk with the student.",1,2,1,1,0,1,1,0,0
"In ""The challenge of the Exploring Venus"" it shows alot of the good and bad of studies that will help us understand why the author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article stated that it is one of the brightest point of light in the sky.

Vince is the 2rd closest plant to the sun which meaning 800 degrees fahrenheit and the presseure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, although Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun, if humans lived there ther could be a chance of additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freqent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Otherwise the planet would still have some efatures that are analogous to those on Earth such like Valleys, mountains,and craters.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Asronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may erll once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and i trust that the astronomers would say that because we still think that Mar would be our planetary visit. Although humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on the ""cloud-draped world"" as they call it. They have said that no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours ,despite its proximity to us and, of course should like a big danger and risk to take, not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. NASA's possibile solution to hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.

Researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance, Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risks, they are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus, and some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simlating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. But now they use mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played lots of important roles in the 1940s, by comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

What i think of all of this is that the author us right to suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the danger and chaos it represents human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Eather and beyond should not be limited by dangers and boubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation as the article stated. The astronomers of today they shall wonder off to make Venus a both safe and scienctifically productive, and the people of todays world would be amazing at all the thing that is happening or what will happened to Venus.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Reducing car usuage coul greatly benefit us all. it would decrease death rates, pollution, and money costs.

As towns such as Vauban and Paris participate in car free days, they greatly reduce the amount of pollution that would have become that day. their hard work and enthusiasm even encouraged other cities and parts of the country to join. our pollution rate is much to high for the only planet and space we can live on. increasing it daily will only hurt us and be fatal in the long run.

Death rates caused by cars is another reason to have a few days off from them. Fatalaties caused in accidents, hit and runs, and wrecks happen multiple times daily. a few days or even just one of no/reduced car usage could save the lives of many.

money costs are a large complaint in our society today, especially money involving cars. from the cost of the car itself to the dollars to per gallon used every week, nobody likes to spend that much money on their vehicle. well we wouldnt have to as often if we did have dayswhere cars were fined if used.

citizens should reduce the use of cars to help with financial issues, death rates, and pollution.",1,3,1,3,0,0,1,1,1
"Self driving cars should be encouraged. this coulld be the future of all transportation. Where would this country be without taking risks in new technology. Worst case scenario, if the cars do turn out to be more dangerous than the normal cars, all you have to do is wait for them to improve the model. And when it comes to the laws being written, just make the people sign a contract at the dealership that says the company takes no resposibility over injury.

The first reason i think this should happen is because it could be the future of all transportation, imagine all of the people that would be able to go places because now they dont have to drive.Take drunk drivers for example. in todays society people who arwe drunk arent allow to drive, but if the car drove its self, they would be able to get home safely.People with impare dvision or other sorts of disabilities could also get around without have to depend on someone else.

The second reason as to why i think self driving cars should be produced is because being scared of what ifs isnt going to help this country evolve technology wise. If we wouldnt have taken a risk we wouldnt even have cars. and if we did create something dangerous , all we did was give it to the military.

The third and final reason i think self driving cars should exist is that virtually and problem you can think of can be fixed over time. If the car goes too fast or too slow or has problems turning, all you would have to do is ""update it"". If certain new laws have to be made, fine. If people cant decide who to blame for a accident, make the buyer sign a contract that says the company isnt responsible for an damages to vehicles or people.

In conclusion, ithink that seld driving cars should exist because they are the future of transportation, we need to take risks to advance, and all of the problems would be easily solvable.",2,3,1,3,0,0,0,0,0
"Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a fun and unique job. Like Luke you got to help many people and visit many places. Such as when Luke mentions that he took a gondola ride in Vinice, Italy, a city with streets of water or when he saw the Acropolis in Greece. You also get to help many people. Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy meant that he supplied poor areas in Europe with cattle to recover their food supplies, animals, and more.

The reason why I say it is fun to be a Seagoing cowboy is, because as Luke mentions when all of the cattle was unloaded they often played table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling and baseball and volleyball games. Luke also mentions that being a Seagoing Cowboy was an oppurtunity of a lifetime that he would not want to miss. Luke aslo mentions that caring for the animals on these long voyages often kept him busy along with other things he had to do such as, feeding the animals, watering the animals two to three times a day, bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is an interesting job. Your never bored, your always seeing places, and your always having fun. Whats not to like about it? For Luke being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more the adventure, but it opened up the world to him. He also so said that it made him more aware of people of other countries and their needs. That is why you should become a Seagoing Cowboy.",2,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The Electoral College is a process by which we vote for electors- not actually the president themself. When you vote for the electors, they decide who will be the president. We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose; not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote because it gives the people a say in who runs our country, an easier way to elect persons into office, and no one state has more of a say.

Many poeple believe that we are voting for the president when we vote for our electors, but in reality, we are voting for them to vote. We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom (freedom of speech, religion, ect.)- so why don't we have the freedom to directly choose our president? In the source, 'The Indefensible Electoral Coolege: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong', it states ""...voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This means that we do not vote directly, only for someone else to decide our fate. Written in the text fo the first source, 'What Is the Electoral College?', it reads ""...when you vote for your canidate you are actually voting for your canidate's elecotrs."" With this method, we are never getting results directly, only becoming the middle-man when we should be front and center.

Most think that if we have electors we won't have as much trouble getting a person in office. In the eleventh paragraph, in 'Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral Coolege: Why even the best-laid defences of the system are wrong', under 'What's wrong with the electoral college', its speaks of a ""disaster factor"". The ""disaster factor"" is when we vote for electors and they defy the will of the people; as this had almost happened with segregationists, nearly making the popular vote for Kennedy not go to Kennedy. As well as the fact that we could easily of had a tie in the electoral vote. As it says in the second source, the matter would fall into the hands of the House of Representatives ""...the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president."" This means each state has one vote, meaning the will of the people wouldn't have much say in the election.

People in a state all have the same electors, made by a popular vote, practically taking away the people's voice. If things were to change to popular vote we would all have a say in each election. In the Electoral College way of voting, it is ""...unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state."" Along with the fact that in the Electoral College way, the amount of electors is based on population, making the people of a small state insignifigant. ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the canidates at all..."" If all small states stay this way, they may never be able to have a say in any big decision made by the public.

In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"There are so many reason why using a car can destroy our community,personally I think using your car less would be a good idea. There are some advantages of limiting car usage,as you know the fume inside the car could give you a lot of problem with heart your lungs when you breathing air. By limiting our car usage we could have a chance of protecting the new generation from the polluted gas that comes out of the cars. In some country  many people are happy even they are not using cars to go anywhere example In Germany life goes on without the usage of cars.

Alright look I get that cars are a good transportation device because when your have a long way to go It could be very hard to there and you want to use a car that is acceptable,but like If you have to go somewhere that is 1 mile do you really need a car to get there. You don't have to have a car to have a happy life just look at this little paragraph i have search up.""As a result,70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars,and 57 percent sold a car to move here.""When i had a car I was always tense.""I'm much happier this way,"".

When we use cars a lot it cause us to buy a lot of gas that cost a lot of money. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. Many teens and adults died from car accidents it might because they driving to fastor someting else. All that I am trying to say is that cars can be good for the community or it could bad for the community. That is all and why I think it a good thing to have the advantages of limiting car usage.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Limiting your car usage has benifits to yourself, the community and the environment. In these aricles there's examples of way communities have given up ther cars and how car usage has gone down over the years.

In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. In this expeirimental community, street parking, driveways, and garages are almost forbidden. Car ownership is however allowed, but the only place to park are large garages at the edge of the development. If you own a car and decide to park there, you must buy a space for $40,000, plus a home! The outcome of this has been most of the community don't own cars. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this was said by Heidrun Walter, mother of two and a media trainer. Also this communities idea has been adopted around the world.

An effect of extreme car ususe can be smog. Paris, France has the most smog out of all the other European capitals. They had ""147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in london, Reuters found."" After days of heavy pollution. A partial driving ban was enforced to clear the city's air. Motorists with even-numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home. If they didn't do so, they would be charged with a 22-euro fine. The same order wouls be given to odd-numbered plates the next day. Almost 4,000 driver's cars were fined for using their cars.

In Bogota, Colombia they set up a program, The day without cars it's when cars are banned and only buses and taxis are permitted. Their goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" stated by Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman. The day without cars is part of an improvment campaign that began in bogota in the mid-1990's. during this year's anual day without cars, authorities from others countries have can to see the event and were very pleased by it. "" These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders"" said by Enrique Riera, the major of Asunci`on, Paraguay.

In recent studies it's shown that Americans are buying fewer cars, getting less lincenses, and driving less as each year goes by. Many beleive America's love for cars is deteriorating. The number of miles driven has gone down since 2005. Some think it's because we simpliy can't afford new cars.""A study last year found driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" Even the number of cars per home has gone down. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn"" said by Michael Sivak, a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. If this patterns persists it will be very benificial to the environment. Mimi Sheller, a sociology professer at Drexel University thinks the internet makes people feel more connected, therefore we don't feel the need to drive out and meet friends.

In conclusion, limiting your car usage benifits you and the environment. As quoted in the essay people express how they feel less stressed from not using their cars. Countries and communities around the world are taking part in less car usage and feeling great from it. So i advise you do the same and help yourself and the environment.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"Has anyone ever thought about driverless cars and have you thought about the good and the bad about them? Well i sure have found out a lot about them and I know that people have different mind set about these care because of how they are set up and I can tell you i agree with how they are set up and i like it and here is why.

In the article about ""Driverless cars Are Coming"" I agree about have them

because in paragraph seven the text states that these driveless cars are made to have the seats vibrate when you car is in danger when back up on another object. I also agree because in the text it says that the law is focus on keeping driver, passangers safe. They have made a whole bunch of sensors to put on cars to make them safe.

Driverless cars are a exellent idea I think because in the text it clearly states everything about the car and it tells about it and I agree with the idea because of what the law requires and howthey have mad it safe for people and there objects for there cars I also thought it was a good idea because of the way the they put the sensors in the car.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"venus in one of the brightesrt points of light in the nigt sky, this nickname is misleading

since venus is actually a planet, venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. numerous factors contribute to venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. even more challenging are the clouds of highly carrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere . on the planet superface, temperatures average over 800 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greaer than what we experince on our own planet in ine condition for everyone than humans.

the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus . the nasa is working on other approaches to studying for example venus study the surfaceand have lasted for there weeeks in such conddition, by comparation, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

"No way can that actually be made by aliens. The pictures don't lie, it is a natural mesa. We haven't even found life yet so how can we assume this is made by aliens.

The face is really just an illusion. It is just a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that, ironically, make it look like a face. We only released it to the public to get an attraction to Mars. The program didn't mean for all these conspiracies. All we wanted was some publicity for mars.

We even took another, better picture to prove it. I know not all people believe us that it isn't an alien monument. If you look at the picture though, it is clearly a natural landform. The picture was ten times sharper than the original. Still you doubt are findings about the landform.

Again, I think whole-heartedly that it is natural. You can believe what you think it is. We don't even know of life on Mars, how can aliens make it if none are even there. You can be a fool and think that it is a alien monument, but the pictures show it. It is nothing but a perfectly natural monument on the possibly populated Mars.

You may never believe me unless you go there and see it yourself. Personally it easily shows to be a natural landform. Many believe to this day that aliens made that structure and that it is impossible to have a natural sturctue of that likeness.

"dear state senator

Over the years many people have complained that voting for a president of the united states is unfair. That they fell that someting should be done to change the voting system. In the articals given to me i have read some resons to keep it and to abolish it. In source one the electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers astablished it in the constitution as a compromise between elections. For the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens.

The electoral college consists of 538 electors but if a majority is 270 electoral votes. Under the 23rd amendment of the constitution the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for pourposes of the electoral college. You are choosing an electors when you vote for president because when you vote for a canidate u a really voting for your candidate's electors. There are some little things that need to be done to fix it a little like fir example the part thats stats that smaller states have barly no power and that most presedents dont even wory about then becuse they don't make muche of a difrance. Each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarly betrayed). The other problen that is with this system is that the winer takes all when the are may poeple that vote for ether for the republican or democratic if the oponunt has more votes they won all the electors and the oponunt does not get any votes from that state so its like you didin't even vote.

"Do you think that Venus is worth exploring? Well in the story, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" it tells you how scientists are trying to explore Venus. Venus is called the,""Evening Star,"" because of how we can see it as the brightest point in the night. Venus is also, a planet that no human can survive on; the planet is hot, and has high pressure. The conditions far more dangerous than any human has done on earth.

However, the challenge of finding what this planet has and, how it can help us on earth. Has made scientists want to find out about this more. Imagine someone has finally, found something on Venus; everyone would be amazed by it. That is why they want to find out about Venus even if it dangerous.

Although, Venus is a planet that we can not land on without burning. Scientist have reason on trying to find out about this planet. For example, Venus is referred to Earth's ""twin,"" because it has the same density, size, and closest to earth,even if something we are closer to Mars, because of the speed of the earth. However, because Venus is more like earth scientist think that their is a posibility that is we might need to move to another planet. Venus might be the better option than any other planet. That is why scientist want to know.

All in all, even if scientist think it's impossible to find something about Venus, they will try and figure out. It might be hard but, I believe that people like challenges. Even if we can not there might something they can do, like make a robot that can stand hot and high pressure.",1,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0

The differences in speed mean sometimes venus is right around the corner but sometimes venus is closer to mars and and it can be close to the earth as well.

These conditions venus have are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth;such the enviorment venus has.97% of carbon dioxide blankets a thick atmosphere of venus even more challenging the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature averages at 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90x greater than what the earth achieves.

The temperature and pressure in Venus's enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the ocean would liquefy all metals and minerals. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Just as our jet airplanes travel at a high altitude to fly over many storms a vehucle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At 30+miles above the surface temparatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. Not only easy conditions but survivable for humans.

NASA is working on different approaches for studying venus. A new test of simplified electronics made up of silicon carbide jave been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and only have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions. These devices were 1st envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during WWII. The thought of computers and devices existing in those days may sound shocking but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all Modern computers nowdays are enormously powerful,flexible,andquick,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure heat and other forces.",1,3,3,2,0,2,1,2,0
"There are numerous amounts of risks and rewards that come with the study of Venus, and it is difficult to know whether the good outweighs the bad. The author attemtps to support the study of Venus by including facts and the possiblilty of scientific discoveries. I believe, however, that the author failed to be pursuasive in his support on the subject, due to his lack of supporting evidence and his stating lf the many risks of studying Venus.

The authors most critical mistake in the article was the use of too many facts that caused more concern for risks, and not enough rewards that would come with the study of Venus. He states the conditions of Venus, temperature, atmospheric pressure, its carbon dioxide plagued atmosphere, along with many other negative qualities of the planet. The article even states the failed spaceship landings on the planer. To the reader, stating these facts is credible, but too many of these negative qualities fail to entise the reader into thinking that the study of the planet is a good thing.

The author also fails to persuade the reader when dicussing the positive impacts that this study could entail. Too many of the topics the author writes about are hypotheticals and provide, at times, little factual evidence. These hypotheticals and the small proportion of facts used are also mixed together with risks amd negative outlooks as well. Very little is said to make one think that the study of Venus is vital or logical.

The author used little positive facts about the study of Venus, and talked of too many risks of this pursuit. He did not effectively pursuade me to believe that studying Venus is a worthy aspiration; rather, his facts and evidemce ,ade the exploration seem illogical. In order to support this cause to the bedt of his ability, the author must use more facts instead of mainly hypothetical situations, and use less negative facts about the study.",2,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Dear State Senator,

I strongly believe that we should change our election to popular vote. The Electoral College has a ton of problems that can not be worked out. In the artical ""What is the Electoral College?"" it states in line 7 that, ""most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate."" I understand how majority rules, but the number electoral votes should be proportional to the popular vote. I am aware that, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast."" as stated on line 22 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. However, I would rather be in a situtation where I know my vote counted for the president, than use the Electoral College and avoid ties that could still happen. ""It is the electors who elect the President, not the people."" as stated in line 15 of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President. In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, it states that ""That those electors could always defy the will of the people."" What is the point in voting if the will of the people can be defied? I strongly believe that we should change to popular vote.",1,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,3
"Joining this prgram was the best. There was a few incidents that happened while I was on this trip, but it was an amazing experience.

When I was on that ship it felt good. I was around all the animals. I mean who wouldnt want to go on a trip. The air out there feels good, taking care of animals was also a lot of fun. And being with my friend made it better. When he asked me if I wanted to go, I couldnt say no. Id never get a chance like this again.

I cracked my ribs but that didnt stop me from enjoyong where I was. My ribs hurted bad but this was an incident, a little mistake but a big combat. But that did stop me from enjoying the things around me. I even visited some cool places while a shore. Seeing the big blue ocean and waves was pretty. Helping out was a fun job. The animals were all friendly and the games that were played were fun to watch and to participate.

Being on night watch was scary because it was pitch black and the boat was very rocky. I got thruough the night eventually so everything was ok. Having people there with me and everyone being friendly

was a nice feeling. In my opoinion, I think everyone should have this experience because somed people have never been to sea, or they never ridden on boat before. Its alot of fun there and a nice place to explore and be with animals and just kind of relax.

In the end, I had alot of fun. A little mishap happened but other than that it was a ball of joy. Everyone should get a chance really. To have a nice experience on the ocean instead of being afraid to go because of sea sick and stuff. Itll be alot of fun if people go. They will enjoy thereselves and be alright.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,1
"Think of all the things we humans have accomplished. We know how to fly in the air, breathe underwater,

and travel on water. And now wehave cars that can be driverless. Im going to discuss my opion on driverless cars

First, off the saft of the car. The car is safe, it has sensors that are more advanced to detedt and respond to dangers on the road. The information given from these sensors can cause the car to apply the brakes, its reaction is alot better than a human one. The car can handle driving up to 25 mph. On the other hand there are special tough sensors that make sure

the driver keeps a hold on to the wheel. Even though the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, they are still dessinged to notify drivers when the road needs human skills. The driver musr be alert the whole time if there comes a time to take the wheel. Manifactures bring entertainment in the car, but also safty, it alerts right away, so the system of the car is safe, and safty is of more concern than entertainment.

Secoundly, expenses.The dream of driving cars without human assisnt is almost her, but the prices or high. The techonlogy they use Is advanced and cost alot. and the question is, will we be able to afford such cars. Some devices cost about two hundred

million dollars. The cost should probably be reasonable if they would liek people to by there cars.

Thirdly, The laws of the driverless car. they should have laws about safty and regulations about these cars. New laws can help strengthen the safty of those driving this car.And if someone gets hurt than its the drivers fault if there are any indications that the driver was reckeless. But if there is proof that the manifacture is at fault then they should face the repricutions.Maybe later in our future we can have more states approve of computer driven cars.

I belive that these cars will be safe and that are furture is advancing, As long as these cars are safe and can prevent

accidents, then me as a driver is on the side of driverless cars.",2,2,0,2,0,0,1,1,0
"I think that the electoral votes should not decide who the president is. This is a nation where people have the right to vote, and the fact that the votes of the people don't even matter is not right. What is the point in even voting if our vote doesn't count, what is the point in the candidate giving speeches to the people if it's all just for nothing. The popular votes are the ones that should be counted twards who becomes the president. People all over the country are told to vote, or are guilted into voting becomes it's a right that we should be happy and proud to have but then the vote that we put on the ballot doesn't make a difference, it's the electoral votes that really matter. What makes them more important than us. The electoral votes are not democratic.

Yes the electoral college does somewhat ballence out the big states from the little states (based on population) but that still doesn't matter. If over 50% of the United States votes for one person but then they lose to someone with a little more electoral college votes then are they really our president, we the people didn't vote for him so then why is he allowed to be our president. The founding fathers gave us the right to vote but the truth is that the vote isn't really real. I think we should just change it so that the people are the ones that get their votes counted because you can't tell us to go voted and then not even let it mean something. Being able to vote is one of the things that we have that most other countries don't have, but the reality is that our vote is disregarded and somebody else makes the vote for us.

Do you think that people are going to want to vote for someone if it is basically just a waste of time. If the votes actually counted I bet a lot more people would go to the polls. People would be more interested in the speeches and wanting to listen to their views if they knew that their vote was important to the candidate. In 2012 only about a half of the people who were eligible to vote didn't and that number could keep getting lower if we don't change it. The younger generation doesn't care right now because they already know that their vote doesn't matter.

The electoral votes only have five reasons as to why they should stay.

Certain of outcome

-Incase of dispute over the outcome

Everyone's president

-Requires candidate to have trans-regional appeal

Swing states

-Winner-take-all method awarding electoral votes

Big states

-Balances the small states and the big states (population)

Avoid run-off elections

-Avoids both candidates havingno majority

The electoral votes don't seem to be very American. The whole electoral college system is confusing and as said in the passage ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes. If we were to have a vote (and the peoples votes actually counted) that asked people if they want to keep the electoral college or get rid of it I bet over 50% of the people in this country would want to get rid of it.",3,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it states many reasons why, how and when these cars are coming. My position or point of view on this matter is that it is a negitive thing. There are many reasons stated on how it can be positive, such as fuel and less time consuming, or negitive, such as safety and money. I will tell you many of these reason and why i find it a negitive solution in the next few paragraphs.

The positive ideas stated in the paragragh are less fuel, safer, and you dont have to completely manualy drive a car yourself. In this article one of the many reasons why driveless cars would be safer is they can steer, accelerate, brake themselves, and they notifie the driver when the need to take over the controls for certain situations. Safety is a be concern to modern drivers, the article states manufactures want to bring entertainment to the cars while you enjoy your trip. These displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature.

The reasons why these cars have not been made yet isn't because we don't know how to make them or even manufacture them. Which leads us to our negitive effects, It's because of the law and expense of redesighing a mass restruction of all the roads. According to the article, Lawmakers focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and safety is best acheived by this if the drivers are alert. Another concern is what happens if there is an accident? Who is to blame the driver or the manufacturer? The article says that these smart cars will have to use the binary code. These smart-road systems worked well, but required massive upgrades to existing roads, somthing to expensive.

My position on the article is that driveless cars is not the way to go because of money, safety, and the need for future generations to know how to manualy drive a car. Its not safe in some aspects such as what if the driver isnt fully alert to perdict when they need to take over. Yes the fuel is half as much as it use to be but the road construction op front is way to expensive for us to do for the cars to be as safe as possible. Future generationd will not know how to fully drive a car and if something were to happen where they would need to, they wouldnt be able to. That's why my position on this argument is that it is a negitive idea and we should just stay the way we are.

In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it gives us many good facts aon why cars driveing themselves should be a thing and why not. My position on the matter is that cars should be incontrol most the time. But there are many postitive ideas on the subject and if the laws change may help us to be safer in, on, and out side the car.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0

"Could it be an alian? The Face that appear on Mars is not an alian or a creature its a natural landform. The photos that were taken showed like an Egyptian Pharaoh or a fave called the Face. The scientis at NASA made a research about it.

First on 1976, the Vinking's photo was taken. In that photo it showed that there was a face on Mars. You might think that it was an alian or that their is life on Mars. The photo didn't showed so many details. The camera did't have good quality, you couldn't tell what it really was.

Later on, on 2001 another photo was taken. This time the camera had a better quality. Each pixel was 1.56 meters compare to the old photo that it was 43 meters per pixel. You could see the Face three times bigger. The details where much more clear.

Eventually taking all those photos, the scientist finally came out with an answer. Garvin was saying that,"" If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" All those things he listed were natural landforms on Earth. So as the Face on Mars. The picture shows a Martian like butte or mesa.

After all the research Garvin says, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" By saying that its pretty clear that is was any of what you may be thinking. Before all the research I though it was an alian or a creture too . Now there is nothing to worry about is just a natural landform just like Earth have some too.",2,3,2,3,0,0,1,1,1
"Like Da Vinci he could tell what Mona Lisa emotions were just by studying her face.thats why new software was made to see what peoples acuall emotions are .thats why there so many industries has this.

In the artical the authior is talking about how they have a new system called the Facial Action Coding System, and it detects someones face expressions to see if there sad ,happy,etc . It has some kind of 3D effect to were they can detect the feelings that person has. Now like the Mona Lisa they can put that picture into to that computer system and acually see what see was feeling. Most people dont even use computers anymore because its a waste os time and resorce.

There for students can probably tell what their friend is feeling just buy the look on the face . Some probably dont even know how to do that so there probably going to use that FACS(facial action code system) to see what that person is acually feeling. Most people like Da Vinci study peoples faces to see what there feeling and to paint them . But in todays generation no ones uses that kind of ssytem they just look at someones face and tell what there feeling .Thats why the authior was talking about how studentscan just tell what there friend was feeling.

In the artical it talks about how you move your face a certan way to create emotion. Like say if your really tired , a muscle around your eye called Orbicularis Oculi Pars Palpabraeus will make something we know called crows-feet. Most time when someone is feeling sad or happy there muscles in there face will move if they want to be happy or sad. Not only does facial muscles expresses emotions they produce them . Like for an example some producers will make there celebirty make facial excersises .

All of this about new computer system and facial emoitons are all the same , just not done in the same way . Like if your scrolling on soilcal media and an Ad makes you smile thats still emotion. All its basically about is muscular action units in the face. But some people can be fake smiling to were you can tell because when you real smile the corners of your mouth will lift up call Zygomatic.

"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States and I know I'm not alone on this one. ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their life time agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electorial college!"" That's not enough well, ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" 60 percent is more than a half, now it says over 60 percent which would be past 60 percent. Remember the disaster factor , it is unfair to voters, and what if there is a tie in the electoral vote.

First of all, lets just take it into thought that it is unfair to voters. How? Well, ""Beacuse of the system winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" state."" In 2000, the campaign that was going on, well 17 states did not see the candidates at all. Also, including Rhode Island and South Carolina. What about the fact that, ""Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Not even one. Some might say that it doesn't matter if they have a campaign ad or not, believe me, I've heard it before. Having a campiagn ad shows people what you want to do, how you want to help, how you want to make a change, ect... I don't understand how unfair it can be to people.

Second of all, what would happen if there was a tie in the electoral vote? Well then, the election would be passed to the House Of Representatives, state delegation vote on the president. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35 million voters."" The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.

Third of all, lets just go back to memory lane and revisit the

Disaster Factor . This was the single best argument against the electoral college. ""The Americans people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century;the system allows for much worse."" State legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors. ""In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...."" Want that to happen again now?

Thank you for reading and understanding my point. You have an opinion and I respect that, but I also have one too. Sometimes they just need to be heard. So lets just say that it s unfair to voters, there could be a tie, and lets not forget the Disaster Factor. ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Have a good day.

Thank you for your time.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"For those who believe in Aliens, and believe this face is built by aliens, I have some news, its not and i can argue my point in three different ways. Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.

First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo"". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.

Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!"" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .

I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.

Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face

Concluding my argument of no other life form on mars, I hope I one helped you with your facts, changed your idea of the other life form (not saying you have to). I do not 100% disagree with other life forms but for this one I do.",4,3,3,2,0,0,1,1,0
"I think things should be like the old days where not everone owned cars. There many advantages in limiting car usege, such as less accedince, better formed communities. There would be more people getting to know there neibors and would be a nice friendly place to stay. People would be in better shap and we would be the fatest country in the world anymore. Experts say automobels are the leading couse of green house gases.

Experts say that green house gases are poisioning are atmophere. So why would we poision what we need to live. why not hang up the keys and get a little exersise get some fresh air.

Its proven that people who exersise often feel better and live a little long. So insted of being lazy walk to work or school get in shap we need to stop teaching are youth that its ok to be lazy. Thats why are country is that fattest inn the world today.

If less people drive there will be less accedice less people will die because of careless driving or drunk driving. Its a fact that car crashes are the leading couse of teenage deaths. So why put yourself in that percent of people who crash just going to the store or to a friends house.

If communitys didnt have cars it would be just like the old days where everyone knew everyone. People would be more involved in the community there would be alot less crime because everone would most likely be friends with everone. people would be getting together and having  cook outs and having a good time with there niebors.

"One thing that robots have never been able to do is having emotions. The Facial Action Coding System can provide a new opportunity for emotions to be incorparated into technology. The software allows for computers to read emotions on human's faces and interpret that data. In a classroom, this software can be extremely valuable to educators.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom can prove to be an extremely powerful tool to educators, as long as it is used in moderation. An educator could use the tool during a lesson to make sure students are engaged, and if a student is bored, the teacher could adjust the lesson plan for that student. The teacher would also know when to help students if the machine is reading them as confused. However, the technology should not replace a teacher in the classroom, as Dr. Huang Suggest, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto). The software can read the emotions, but it can't provide it's own emotions or give the same one-on-one connection a teacher can to help a student. The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should not be used as a teacher, but by a teacher, so as to help every student get the most out of their education.

While this new technology can be a fantastic tool, if not used properly, it could have a terriblle outcome. The machine can read a face and give percents of emotions someone is feeling, as shown in the first paragraph, ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (D'Alto). However, if humans start using this software constantly, it might begin to replace our own emotion reading skills. However, the ability of the software to detect certain muscle movements associated with faking a smile and other complex emotions, can prove extremely useful in a school. Educators can usually read emotions pretty well, but when a face shows mixed emotions and a student is trying to hide some of them, this system could help a teacher understand what's going through a student's head.

The Facial Action Coding System is a huge leap in computer and human interaction. Used carefully, this software can allow for teachers to be even more engaged in their students and know how each person is doing with a lesson. This technology is very valuable to the classroom and should be implemented to benefit student's education and to further our knowledge of emotions.",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Would you rather walk or drive a car going to work?

it would be much more easier to drive a car, right? In today's generation people use their car for transportation going to work or just driving around. All their going to do is pay more gas and spend more,but gas today is more expensive than years ago. Many people need to realize that their are to wasting gas and it can create more traffic jams because many people need to get to their destination on time or not on time. The fellow citizens needs to have an advantage of limiting car usage.

To begin with, Car can create more gas usage because many people just go to shorter destination or longer destination. But the things is that people just waste gas because they dont realized how they are spending a lot of money. For example, a girl is going to the store closer to home, she is thinking if she going to drive her car or walk and she is thinking to drive her car, why? because she would rather not walk or she is to lazy. The girl is wasting her gas. In today's society many people need to open their eyes and realized thing on how much they are spending on car usage.

Bagota"", "" Bogota, Columbia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jam (paragraph 20)"". This quote states that many of the Colombians are supporting their country car usage. They would rather hiked, bikes, skated or took buses to work. Also, it cannot lead to traffic jams. The fellow citizens need to look over what many people are trying to do to limit their car usage because other people cannot afford buying a car. For example,  many years ago only people who are wealthy can only afford cars and those who cannot afford it, they would make an effort to make things as possible to get in their destination and enjoy walking rather than riding car.

Furthermore, walking and riding a bike could make things possible for everyone. People need to notice that driving a car could make things much harder. According to this source 1: "" In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", "" In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities, and legislators are to act, if cautiously"". This quote states that the United States are planning to reduce car usage because it looks like many people today are having a lot of car accidents. For example, driving while texting. This can create less accidents.

In conclusion, Fellow citizens need to set their limits on car usage.

they need to realized on how it  can create a mess in the world full of car transportation. Also, knowing on how much they pay for gas  and also it can lead to massive traffic jams. They need to have  advantage of using car usage. They could ride a bike or walk to go reach their destination.",2,2,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Venus is a planet that is like Earth, only without life and water. It is the second closest planet to the sun. This makes it the hottest planet, hotter than Mercury, which is closer to the sun. This planet is special, though. It keeps people from examining it closely because of its conditions. The planet is too hot, the pressure is high, and it also has a thick atmosphere that makes it hard to see, but we can overcome that with some ideas and by studying it more.

Venus is like Earth in a lot of ways. It is believed to have had water and life on it before, and it even has physical features like Earth. It also is almost the same size and density as Earth. Scientists want to explore this because it is there first option for space travel. Earth is sometimes closer to Venus than it is to Mars. They want to find out the best way to make it hospitable for people to live there. They have sent unmanned probes there to scout out the territory and to find samples and more evidence that could help them. However, the probes don't last long because of the harsh atmosphere.

There are a couple reasons why it is hard to study. The planet is simply too hot and melts metals easily and quickly. The pressure is higher than our ocean, meaning it can crush us and even a submarine easily. There is also a thick atmosphere made of 97% carbon dioxide that blocks our vision. There are clouds of highly corrosive sulferic acid in the atmosphere too. There are also casual earthquakes, lightining, and volcanoes erupting. Scientists want to discover more things about Venus because it was like Earth, and the won't stop.

There are a couple of things that scientists have though of so far. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has though of a flying craft that is in the air above the surface of Venus. This way its not too hot and the pressure isn't too high. However, this won't work because they still can't see past the dense atmosphere. There are more tests like putting things in a simulation of Venus's surface to see how long it could last. There is also a thought of making the machines not so fragile like our technology these days that can be more resistant to the forces of Venus.

The author thinks that overcoming the obstacles and challenges that Venus has for us has value. He thinks this because it will lead us into more exciting ""endeavors."" The author thinks that our travels shouln't be limited. He believes they should be expanded "" to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" I believe the author wants to know more and is curious about the unknown. The author does a great job showing all of the dangers and benefits of traveling and examining Venus. Even the title shows that it won't be easy. The planet is currently too hot, it blocks our vision from above, and the pressure is too high, but we can overcome that by making more ideas and by studying this planet more.",3,3,3,3,1,2,3,2,2
"The Electoral college is unnecesary because the people of the United States do not always get to control what their state electors vote for. The state legislatures are the ones responsible for choosing the electors, not the people. Others may say that the electoral college works and that it should be here to stay. Many opinions are to be heard.

A reason that people may want the electoral college is stay in place would be that the electors would do all the dirty work for them and they won't have to cast two votes the year that the new president will be chosen. The electors also get benefits for representing the states vote. They may also want to take advantage that the electoral college is still running.

The main reason that the electoral college is unnecesary is because the voters do not get to choose who the candidates are for the electoral college, therefore not knowing who the electors are and also not knowing who the electors want to vote for. The reason that some electors choose the wrong president are because the people don't really get a say in who the electors will vote for. They may protest and make signs to show their state electors who they people want as their president and the electors might listen to them, but overall the decision is the electors. The state legislators are the ones responsibe for choosing the electors, not the people of the state. So the elector may be a democrat and the majority of the people in that particular state are republicans. Would that be fair that that state was to vote for the opposite person running for presidency when the people obviously want the other candidate?

Many people have a lot to say about this particular topic. some may say that the electoral college works. Some people may say that the electoral college is not worth the bother. Many opinions are out there about the electoral college. but i say that the electoral college is unfair,irrational, and outdated.",1,3,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argrument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys progam. Soon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice,Italy. Bomberger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there was empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table-tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more expeirence working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Bomberger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an aventure. It was a life lesson.",1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2
"In this article the author describes the Facial Action Coding System and descrbes the wide range of its usefullness and power. From this article we can see how this new technology finds emotion through a face as well as how that information looks once it's calculated. From this passage I feel that this technology is very useful and could help alot of people.

One of the many uses for this technology is that it has the ability to help others when they are bored or confused in a classroom. This technology can modify the lesson in order for the student to better convey the information needed. This helps students get a better understanding of the material while still learning in a way that fits that students prefrences. If this were to be in schools today I feel that it would help thoughs who may be failing not because they want to but because they aren't understanding the material.

This technology can also help adults as well wheather it would be for advertising ,for video game companies,or for video surgery. When it comes to advertising this technology can recognize the enjoyment or displeasure you may get out of an advertisment. Say you like it and smile, the computer may regognize this and continue to provide you with similar ads that fit what you like. As for the last two being about video games and video surgery these two can construct faces in a more exprssive way than it would without this technology.

This article shows just how useful this technology is and represents just how far technology has come since. This is an important resource that could help many with alot of things. As well as help teach those who are confused. And even to better advertise a product to someone. And for these reasons I feel that this technology is valuable.",2,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Mr Senator,

After being informed of the United State's combination othe the electoral college and election by popular vote, I was asked wether or not we should keep the electoral college or change the election to just a popular vote. I thought about this for a while and I believe the electoral college is beneficial to the results of the election.

We are Americans. We can be innovative and change the world but we can also be lazy and uneducated. While most Americans are informed about the election and who is running, Mickey Mouse is still the most popular write-in on the ballot. Why not have a group of citizens who represent our state and party have a say in who should be president? ""..each party slects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" (Source 3). The electoral college is a group of sofisticated men and women who do this as their job. While the average American is tending to family, working or watching tv, their electors are learning the viewpoints of the presidential nominees and deciding wich one they think would be the best leader of our country. Why would it be anything but harmful to our country if we got rid of it?

I understand that you might be saying that voters don't vote for the president and electors overrule the popular vote. Electors are just an easier and more equal way of distributing the votes and electing a president. Only in rare cases has the electoral vote overruled the popular vote. Have you ever thought there might be a reason behind that though? Assuming the government isn't majorly corrupt and the elections are fixed, wouldnt you think that the slate you voted for should be trusted? Maybe they know something you don't or have witnessed the candidates actions in the past that could've swayed their vote. Citizens are keen but they do not know everything that goes on behind the scenes.

The Electoral College makes sure that there is a transregional appeal. Not one area can overrule the other votes. This is very important because it evens out the votes and reduces risks of a split country who doesn't want to follow a president elected by the South. Popular vote alone doesn't do this. If we just go by who was the most votes from citizens then If there is ever a great divide in which party want which president it could also lead to a divide in the country itsself. This could even lead to a civil war and make these 50 states not-so united. The fact that we have a system to keep order doesn't mean that we should get rid of it just because people want their write-in ballot of a cartoon character to mean more.

Keeping the Electoral College is necessary for the unity of our country. We should trust our slate of electors to vote the way we want them to. If they don't, the blame shouldn't automatically be put upon them. Since we elected the trustworthy slate, shouldn't we believe they have the best interest of the country and their party in mind? The Electoral College should stay as it is. This system keeps order, balances votes, and 99% of the time it works.

Sincerely,

High school student",4,3,1,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming,"" the author gives both positive and negative aspects of driveless cars. I feel though that having a driveless car will be more positive than negative. I feel the development of driveless cars can benefit humanity very well. The development should continue so that it can bring on a new form of public transportation.

In the article it says ""They (driveless cars) can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills,"" this makes driveless cars very safe to drive. not only will it get the passenger where they need to go but will alert them if their skills are needed. This makes for a safer but also more relxing drive to the destination.

Its also states in the article that driveless cars have ""Four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor"" and a dubbed LIDAR which helps update the car of its surroundings. So driveless cars provide even more safety to passengers by knowing its surroundings places the passenger of the car probably wouldnt be aware of is he/she was driving.

So i believe driveles cars are the future of cars because of these reasons. Driveless cars provide safety and a relaxing trip to its passengers regular cars just can't. They should be continously developed for better safety and more human like driving skills. Driveless cars are a great form of automotive transportation with safety that cant be matched.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Countries like France, Columbia, Germany and USA have took part in reducing greenhouse gasses by reducing if not excluding vehicle transportation. Stats have shown less amounts of carbon in the air and less congestion in imense cities like Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia.

Source two states that Paris typically has more smog then other cities in Europe like Brussels and London. They're taking action by allowing even-numbered license plates to drive one day and have the odd-numbered license plates leave their cars at home and the same would apply to even-numbered plates the following day. Anyone against that restriction would be given a 22-euro fine or 31 dollar fine. That method decreased smog and congestion by 60 percent.

Source three talks about the country of Bogota, Columbia. This town or city has took a big step into reducing gas emisions where not only they participate but other local towns and cities as well. They contribute by leaving their cars home all day for one day to reduce the amount of carbon and smog in the air which helps the enviroment. People hiked, biked, skated or took the bus to work. violaters faced a 25 dollar fine. Not only does this benifit the environment but it helps people conversate more with each other. "" it's a good opportunity to take stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.

As it is said in source one, "" As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The small suburb town of Vauban, Germany is home to 5,500 residents were its perimeter is just a rectangular square mile. It is seperated away from all city life where people get around by walking to nearby stores. It may be the most advanced expirement in low-car suburban life. Developed countries or developing countries should think about all the gasses that go into the air and damage the surroundings and take part in to reduce the harmful greenhouse gasses.",3,2,3,3,1,1,2,1,1
"The image that Viking 1 took in 1976 was a startling one to say the least. A rather creepy face looks up at the surveyor. It is as if someone built a face in the side of the planet. And many people did see it that way.

But as the descriprion says in the story ""...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So NASA the space program, states that it is meerly shadows and hills. I would think that they would be a more trust worthy source than anyone else telling you that this was an alien's doing.

Many people claimed that NASA was trying to hide this information but as the article states ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This is because in part they are probalbly intrieged by the idea of an alien civilization, but also because it would bring in a lot of buisness. The funds that it would bring in would be enourmous. I just cannot think of a reason why NASA would wan't to hide that.

Then again in 1997 NASA snapped another picture of it ten times as sharp as the last one. revealing rocks as can be seen in the picture. And still some were unhappy with the results and asked for more. In 2001, they got their results. NASA caught a picture with ""maximum resolution"" and it is evident in the picture that these are hills. They state in the article ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see waht they were!"" It states in the article that it is like butte or mesa-landforms which can be found in Western America. These shapes are made on earth natrually. So why can't they be made on another planet natrually?

All the evidence points to a natrual land-scape on Mars. Anyone who would read this here would understand that. Every arguement made to disolve this has been met, crushed, and surpassed by another piece of EVIDENCE not claims or theories. So conclusion: Face on Mars is just rocks and shadows not alien life.",3,4,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"Dear state senator,

The United States has envolved to a rather unique voting system. It is based off of points regarding population. Which ever canidate has most votes in that state wins the points. The points then add up to a score and who ever recives a certian amount of points win. But, some could say this system is unethical and outdated.

Starting back to our founding fathers is when this system orignated. But, why do we still follow this system? Although it is tradition, is it not a good time for change. After all society is increasing to a much greater perspective. When the founding fathers created this system it was a much different time then. Today society has envolved to technology, equality, and high levels of population. The founding fathers most likely never expected the future to be like this. Also today magority of individuals of envoking changes in their lives. We should move with the flow of socitey and change with it. When does tradition become long enough? Maybe now or maybe in the distant future. But, no matter the case we should change and move forward soon, so we do not get lost in the dust trails of the human race.

Life is full situations of unfairness. But, would you expect a goverment to be unfair? Most likely not. This system prevents most citzens voice to be revealed. It takes an advarage citzens opinion on who they want to lead and puts it into a dark cave. It takes votes in each state and gives it an advarage overall vote for that state. How is that fair if the United States does not tally all votes? Instead they just award points. How are points going to show how a country feels? No, we should tally everyones votes instead of the states votes. Also most of the time states follow their govermental believes regarding being a republican or demorcrate. Maybe this shows that a state is bais and is rigged. We will never no because the goverment hids stuff from us. Maybe our votes are not ever taken into consideration. Maybe it is just numbers estimated to show that they are and they cover it up by saying ""oh it is just points do not worry about your opinion"". If any of that is ture, which it most likley is then shouldn't we envoke an ethical change for rights.

Why should a system that is old and shelding the truth remain with in a goverment that ""cares"" about their citzens? Are they afriad of change? Maybe they just do not want chnage because it is so easy to hid everything with the cracks and creaks of this system. But, they will never listen. They silence citzens by telling a lie. They make you think they no best. They allude to you that they help you. But what have they really done. Yes, offer protection. But, also put us in debt, made us loss jobs. They are to eaten up by ego the miss the concept of everyday citzens. Look into the truth of what is really out there.",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars really are not such a thing of the future anymore. They are here and they are improving to imitate human driving abilities, but are we humans so sure that we want them? I mean, sure the driverless car seems so convienient and everything, but if you still have to pay attention to the road then what is the point? Driverless cars may seem great, but they truly are not.

So many teenagers are foaming at the mouth practically to get there license when they turn 16, and some people just love to drive in general. They would not want to be driven around by a computerized car. Driving yourself around is a passion for some people. I personally do not think driverless cars should be a thing. Technology is always getting bigger and smarter, but will it truly be smart enough to simulate the thought process of a human brain in a bad situation while driving? It does not seem very likely. While there are many pros to driverless cars, there are also cons. One of the main cons that comes to mind when I think of a driverless car is the safety of it. I mean sure, they may be proven to be safe, but almost all technology messes up at somepoint. How can the creators of driverless cars say that they are completely safe. For all they know there could be an unknown glitch in their server and it could cause the car to crash and the driver to die. Also, in the article they said they use a lot of sensors and radars to simulate that of the human vision. What if one accidentally broke or malfunctioned, but continued to drive seemlessly without error? As mentioned in the article, the driver could be using one of the entertainment systems that they build into the car to occupy the driver while the car is self-driving; consequently, they may neglect to see a car in front of them and crash because they were distracted by the entertainment system, and then there is a possible human life lost. Who would be at fault then? Would the company that made the car be responsible? Or how about the driver who was distracted by the car's entertainment systems? No matter who is at fault for the wreck, the wreck could have possbile been avoided if there was a human driver behind the wheel. These are jsut a couple of the many safety concerns that come with the possibility of driverless cars. While they may be advanced, futuristic vehicles, they seriously be thought about before trusting a human's life with them; consequently, I think they should be kept off of the roads until they are proven 100% safe.

I really do not think driverless cars are a good idea until they can prove that the technology that goes into them will run 100% error free and not malfunction. Until that happens they should not allow them on the roads just for the sake of human lives being at risk. All it could take is a single crash, and while I know that hasn't happened yet, it is bound to and a human life will be lost; therefore, I say keep them off of the roads. Driverless cars are not for us until we can prove that they will not glitch or mess up and crash.",3,3,1,3,1,2,2,3,2
"The advantages of limiting car usage is outstanding not only is it good for the earth but it changes peoples lives, it makes the people happy and they tend to enjoy life more. In fact in the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" it states ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" The article also says that Heidrun Walter, a mother of two, was always tense when she was behind the wheel and so she gladly gave up her vehicle and now lives a very happy life in Vauban.

In Paris they banned driving due to the increase of smog, they planned which days the people could drive on. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" it states ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" At first many people refused and were fined 22-euro ($31) but the people who didn't helped lighten up the smog.

In Bogota, Colombia, the people have a car free day where they walk or ride their bikes to the places they need to go but there are still buses and cabes that the people can take. If the people were to take their own car they would be fined $25.  In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" it states ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s."" The article also says that millions of colomibians have biked, hiked, skated, and rode on buses to work.

In America the people are driving less, buying fewer cars and getting fewer license. The article ""The end of the csr culture"" states ""As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995."" The reason why the percentage is so low is beacuse of the cash-strapped, the americans couldn't affored to buy new cars.",1,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"Driverless cars would be very usefull, epecially in this generation because of all the teenagers now a days using their phones while driving, and causing accidents. A driverless car would help that problem. A driverless car would help all people ranging from all ages. The diverless car also pays closer attention to the road thatn any individual would. A driverless car in general would help people of older age as well.

The driverless car would prevent teenageers and from getting into accidents. Teenages now a days don't know how to stay off their phones so that causes accidents, with a driverless car the car does the driving for you all you have to do is sit there and pay attention every once in a while. The driverless car would protect the driver, especialy when they are not paying any attention to the road.

With all that being said, the driverless car would pay closer attention to the road. Say there might be a deer in the middle of road and the driver isn't paying any attention. The car would sense it and would stop automatically. Say somehting just pops up out of nowhere, the car would know and would sense it. What the car does is it senses it and it reduces power from the engine as it is applying the breaks. That is how that works, and as technology advances this will advance as well and only get better.

My final reasoning is very simple. The driverless car would help out elders who may not have the eye sight that they may have had when they where thirty years old. Also people who loose their hearing, they wouldn't be able to hear certian things that might be going on around them. So the driverless car would help elders get around town a lot better than having to pay a lot of money for a driver or car sevice. Some elders do no pay attention to what is going on, so as long as they would have a driverless car I think they would be good to go.

With all that being said I am all for having driverless cars. They would help prevent accidents epecially with teenagers who are constantly on their phones. The car pays closer attention to the rather than and iduvidual. And finally the car would help elders get around rather than them having to pay alot of money to have a driver or alwasy use a car service. Just in general I feel a driverless car would be great for everyone now a days.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear State Sentor,

Why should we change whats already been working for us? You would never know how the outcome of thing will turn out. I think we should kep the Electoral College out founding father established it for a reason. Would u rather vote for President congress or citizens i pick congress because they already know what u have to do in order to do certain thing, our citizens dont know as much.

According to Richard Posner "" the Electoral College is widely regarder as an anachrinism"" how can u say that now after years and years of this going on.  It advoids problems of elections. Even though states thst know their votes will not have aeffect it still can help. It doesnt belong in the past if it help us pick this many president. Electoral College help reduce when there is pressure for run-off to chose a winner.

Toss up states that can make a diffrence in the voting. Campaign focus on those the most cause they knowow important it is to them winning. In 2012 toss up states help the winner out because they are the most thoughtful voter. And the most thoughtful voter should be the ones the vote. Say's Richard Posner "" and for the futher reason that thye will have the most infromation and attention"" tell you how make of a imapct the toss up states our.

Just like a toss up states of course you going to want to go somewhere there more people to hear you. Thats why you chose a big state to help you out with that. Larger states will catch the capaign more attention rather than a small states becuase of the populations of people to help them out ask President Obama.

"Cars have been a world wide trend for years, but is that trend coming to an end? A new one is coming into play, and it is the car-less suburb and city. The emissions from cars are putting a strain on the health of city air and officials around the world are setting forth the car-less street.

In Germany there is a little suburb called Vauban, which is almost completely car free. While ownership of a vehicle is allowed, the only place someone could park it would be a large garage at the edge of the community, which a space costs around $40,000 to buy. As a result 70 percent of the families ther don't own cars. This new trend is predicted to cut down greenhouse gasses in suburbs and cities, for which cars are resposible. ""Automobiles are the linchpin of of suburbs.... And that, experts say, is a huge impedement to current efforts to drastically reduce gas emissions form tailpipes.... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of... gas emissions in Europe... and some 50 percent in... the United States.""(In German Suburbs Life Goes on Without Cars by Elizabeth Rosenthal p. 5)

In the Colombian city of Bogota millions of city dwellers hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work on a special day called The Day Without Cars. The citizens agree it is a fruitful endeavor, that lowers pollution, releives stress, and provides a great opportunity to excersize. It even set a trend for two other cities who, for the first time since the event started three years ago, joined in the special day. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay. (Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky p.26)

While cars still have their uses, it seems like they are slowly becoming a fading fad. People around the world are embracing a life without cars, and trying to put a dent in the world's pollution. Who knows, if Americans embrace it, there might be an end to the obesity epidemic.",1,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3
"Driverless cars are what some envision as the future. They picture a world where every car is automated, and where every kind of transport is regulated. Many very large companies have poured a fortune into creating technology that will enable the eradication of a need for drivers. However, there are a huge number of negative effects of this movement. I am completely against the idea of driverless cars, for reasons such as recreation, cost, and safety.

First of all, many people in support of driverless cars portray driving as it is now as a dull part of our society that simply wastes time and energy. However, many, many people enjoy driving, simply for the feel and the experience. If driverless cars were to be implemented, there is no doubt that after a while driving oneself would be considered dangerous, irresponsible, and would likely be outlawed. Not only is there no way to implement such as system, as there would be far too much backlash from the community that enjoys driving, it would be wrong to completely forget about and not consider their opinions as valuable as others.

Second, the cost of a system of driverless cars would be enormous, and quite frankly, insurmountable. People do not realize that these cars would not function well in a society with a vast majority of people driving themselves. For a working system, the majority, if not all of the cars on the road, would have to be replaced with driverless cars. There is no way that the government would provide the cost, and there is no way that everyone has the interest in or the money to buy a driverless car. Not only is it impossible to replace every car with a driverless one, insurance and settlements would be nigh impossible to figure out, as even the article says, there is no definitive blame to be made. The operator of the car could blame the manufacturers for a poorly made vehicle while the manufacturers could simply argue the fact that the driver could have taken control of the car at any time.

Finally, safety would be a major concern. One of the article's biggest faults is that it says that driverless cars will be able to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel. Driverless cars are not able to mimic humans, and will never be able to mimic humans, unless artificial intelligence technology becomes equal to humans. People have the ability to consider moral possibilities and choices. For example, if in a case where the options are a collision which saves the driver's life but has a very large chance of killing another driver, or the choice to swerve off the road but result in severe if not fatal injuries to the driver, the machine would not be able to make that decision. Humans have the unique and intrinsic ability to think, quickly and effectively, through a situation. Machines, however, would be forced to make a decision based on a certain goal, whether that may be the prevention of collateral damage, the safety of the driver, or arrival at the destination.

For these reasons, driverless cars absolutely cannot be a possibility or a good decision. I believe companies should be working to help make drivers more safe by adding other safety features, rather than trying to erradicate drivers from the situation altogether.",4,4,2,4,3,3,3,3,4
"This technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, in my opinion. Why? I feel like we dont need such thing to show our emotions we know exactly how we feel why should a computer have to identify that? Maybe others dont want to show the comlete emotion they are showing. It's genius how people come up with things, but it shouldn't be nesseccary to show how I feel.

According to this article, On paragraph 6.. ""A classroom cumputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" This is why we ask questions why we stay after school for extra circular/circulum assignments extra help period. We shouldn't have to go an extra mile to detict how I feel.

Paragraph 4 the author says ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongtion software tracks these facial movements-- in a real face or in a painted face of Mona Lisa."" Do we honestly think a computer could identify how we feel? we at times don't know how we feel we don't always know how the body works or the mind. Everything is based off conculsions, We have therapitst for such things as not knowing our emotions we have people in the world that study the brain and the body. A computer is just expensive and an unesseccary thing.

Some people dont like to express themselves and for a computer to just automatically submit to how I feel is insane! Also indentify the emotion going on in a picture... No way! That is histaricle. Technology is used for so many things but the actual things we need. Can't you trick your body into thinking you're something you are not? would the computer give me false information then?

Paragraph 9.. "" Had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""

I simply say this is unvaulable you would think taking some blood and doing tests or something would show my emotions, but a computer? I disagree, it just scans my face and automatically shows how I feel. It's a waste of time, and not a good source. I know myself more than anything, i know my emotions.",2,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Hey everyone im a scientist from NASA and i believe that when aliens created the unmasking face on Mars.I've worked with NASA for over ""Twenty years"" and believed that the aliens did create the unmasking face of Mars.I have evidence that aliens did create the unmasking face of Mars.""My evidence is one day i was working and we had a camera on Mars and we saw a shadow but it wasn't just your ordinary shadow, the shadow looked like an Egyptian Pharoh"".My team and I created a film on the shadow that we saw, we also made books,magazines, and talkshows about the shadow.The name of the shadow was the alien artifact is what my team and i called it.I'll tell you something else about my work on the alien artifact it's not easy to target Cydonia.The most common are around the american west in the us.""My team and I don't really fly over the face very often, my team and I noted"".Thats the end of my story thanks for listening be sure to watch the film and read the book we would really appreciate.",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Often times I go to seventh period looking at my classmates and see only blank expressions. Like me, they're tired after an enitire day. It is difficult to tell how they are feeling and what are they thinking. I am positive that my teacher struggles with the same issues. She often says things simiilar to ""Use the next 30 minutes to get 2 or 3 problems done"". I don't blame her for the class's lack of enthusiasm. But now shift to the middle of the day, where people have the most energy. Mixed emotions appear, as well as mixed facial expressions. How can a teacher effectively teach if he/she is unclear what students are thinking? In Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", D'Alto discusses using technological advancements in facial recognition to detect exactly how people are feeling. If a classroom uses technologically assisted facial recognition, one would see the following three benefits to a learning environment: more focused education, increased collaboration with students, and creating a safer learning environment.

In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", D'Alto' cites Dr. Thomas Huang, a professor at the University of Illinois. Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" In the first case where a student becomes confused, the teacher now knows what concepts the student is struggling with. This is a major advantage to the traditional school setting. In many of my past experiences helping fellow students, I have found it beneficial to know more about the student. I could relate better to the student, and better predict what could be a possible weakness. With a computer more accurately assting the teacher, the teacher can better address the weaknesses of the class or student. Since the primary goal of the educator is to educate to prepare students for the future, a computer assisted classroom would benefit the teacher in spotting weaknesses. In the latter example where the student becomes bored, a computer would spot a student who is not paying attention. The teacher, who often teaches a class of over 20 students cannot detect a bored face as easily. By focusing on a student who has mentally shut down, the teacher could potentially take disciplinary action, or quickly wake up the student such that the student misses less material that was taught. In both cases, a computer assisted classroom would bring a more focused education to students.

Dr. Huang goes on to predict that the computer ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would relate back to the first example made. By creating a more focused curriculum, teachers can collaborate better with students. It is rarely possible, perhaps even impossible, to teach a class without proper collaboration and communication between teacher and student. By collaborating with students on a more individualized level, the student receives help and education directed at his/her needs. I look back at my personal experiences, where I have needed help on one particular topic. For example, there was a point in my AP Physics class that I needed a detailed explanation of a topic, and I stayed after class to talk with my teacher specifically. Such a computer assisted classroom could help teachers and students alike receive better collaboration, further leading to a better education.

Finally, it is necessary to note the main point of D'Alto's work. His main argument is that computers can help understand the way humans feel. Additionally, a computer can carry out raw calculations millions of times faster than humans can. With the recent events involving gun violence in Ohio, Kentucky, and Florida, it is critical to ensure the safety of the students. At my school, staff now glance over each student entering the building, looking for possible weapons. If a computer assisted school patrolled the doors looking for signs of anxiety, anger, depression, or any emotion that may show signs of intent to harm, a faster response could be delivered before any event occurs. For a long duration of time, the Columbine shooters had displayed emotions of intent to harm. If Columbine High School was assisted with this type of computer technology, perhaps the threats would have been neutralized before fifteen lives were lost. With the help of a speedy computer scanning through hundreds of emotions every day, it would better protect students attending that school. This would contribute to a safer learning environment for students, which further presses the need for this technology in schools, especially in today's society.

To wrap things up, it ought to be clear that this new facial recognition technology has many benefits to schools. Perhaps the only disadvantage would be the cost; however the benefits clearly outweigh the cost. Nick D'Alto's article discussed the techniques of using such a technology, and these techniques benefit the school setting greatly. After analyzing the examples presented, such technology used in schools would provide more focused education, increased collaboration with students, and a safer learning environment, all of which are advantage to schools seeking to provide the best education for the future generation.",4,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Driverless Cars?

Driverless cars? I am not so sure about this idea. Some people will instantly think that this is a fantastic idea. There are also the people that will think like me and say that this idea is not so good. Sure, there are some good things about this idea, but are you sure you want to be drove around by some type of car that uses an AI (Artificial Itelligence) unit?

There are some good things about this. If your car can drive you to places by itself, that would be cool. This would mean that your arms would be free during the drive. This may also let you occupie yourself by being able to do other things while your car is driving for you. This idea may sell for a nice amount of money.

You have to also realize that there are also a couple bad things about this idea too. Have you ever sat down and thought about things that could happen if technology went currupt? What I am about to say may not be likely to happen, but it is possible. What if the car found a way to take control of itself? This could be very bad because you won't have any type of control over your vehicle anymore.

I bet that not to many people have sat down and thought of something like this happening with driverless cars. If the car lost control with you inside of it that could have lead you to a serious injury or even death! I am quite sure that no one wants to die because of a driverless car went currupt and crashed into something, that would be stupid if you ask me. Everyone should stick to driving their car themselves, this is how it should be.

In conclusion, I am not so sure that this driverless car idea is a good one. This idea may have some good things in it, but there are some bad things in it also. I'm sure that not many people thought about what could happen if the car went currupt. The car may take over itself, leaving you with no control. I think people should continue to driving their own cars themselves, this is for the best.",3,3,0,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I think the Facial Action Coding System can bring some help into classrooms. Most students, like myself, get bored when working on the computer. If the computer can read our face expression to see that we are bored and change what's on the screen to something more appealing, then maybe it would brighten the mood.

There's no doubt that most students don't like school and fine it incredibly boring. Working on the computers brings a sort of excitement because we prefer technology over standard teachings. Personally, I would prefer to sit on the computer, like I am now, and learn and do assignments. In fact, I'd rather be able to sit at home and work on school work and be able to take breaks whenever I feel like it.

School is like work, I hate it. if this FACS technology can brighten things up at school, then just maybe it wouldn't be so boring. Maybe I wouldn't mind getting up at 6:30 every morning to get ready and go somewhere I don't even want to go. I would love for a computer to read my facial expressions and change what's on the screen to something more suitable for me.

Like I said before, it's no surprise that the majority of students do not like school. This FACS technology could really have a bright future. If it all goes well then it just might make school a place where children and young adults would actually look forward to going to.",2,3,0,2,2,1,1,0,3
"The Face of Mars has proven to be one of NASA's most mystifying cases to ever be solved. Twenty five years ago, as NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a startling image resembling a human face. After releasing the image to the public, many people became fascinated in the ""face"". This rolled the ball for many people to believe there was an ancient civilization on Mars. However, modern technology and expertise of numerous scientists have discovered the face is merely a natural landform. The use of more efficient cameras have diminished any hopes of alien life on Mars.

NASA's Mars Exploration Program has already identified the area on which the face is found as Cydonia. When the face was first seen in the Jet Propulsion Lab, scientists figured it was a Martian mesa, which were common enough in Cydonia. Although it was abnormally figured in the shape of a human face, scientists already knew mesa's were prominent in the area of Cydonia. Also, modern technology, such as a Mars Global surveyor camera, has revealed the fact that the Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform. The camera's absolute maximum resoultion picture ensures that no ""alien markings"" were hidden by haze, as some skeptics argued. In the 2001 image, each pixel spans 1.56 meters, whereas pixels in the 1976 image spanned 43 meters. Therefore, the better camera quality ensures the truth behind the Face on Mars: a natural landform.

Some people argue that, due to the cloudiness on the planet, alien life could have been hidden by haze. However, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and captured another photo. Garvin explained ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Garvin knew if there were any pyramids or shacks, the camera would have been able to capture it and he would have been able to see it. Thus, there is no chance haze could have hidden the aliens. People also argued that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence NASA would rather hide. This is not the case. Authors thought this would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. Therefore, the belief of life on Mars is simply just for the public. It has been in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. The Face on Mars was used to engage the public, not neccessariy to inform.

Proven from better camera quality and scientific knowledge, people can know believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. If any civilization was there, the Mars Global Surveyor would have been able to seen it. Also, mesa's are common in the Cydonia area, where the face was found. In conclusion, better technology from 1976 proves the Face on Mars is a landfrom, and there is no chance any life on Mars exists based on the face.",4,4,3,3,1,2,3,2,2
"Did you know that Earth had a twin? Well not exactly a twin, but a planet that is very close to Earth in terms of it's density and size. That planet happens to be

Venus. Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it. Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers.

Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is referred as the ""Evening Star,"" as its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. It is the second planet from our sun. Many people confuse Venus with being a star, because of its nickname. trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance.

We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. All of these failed missions have explained why Venus hasnt been touched in more than three decades by a single spaceship.

As you can tell Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study because of its reputation. The atmosphere of Venus is very thick as 97 percent Carbon Dioxide covers all of it. The planet's tempatures on the surface average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is greater than what we experience on Earth by 90, all of these conditions are way more extreme than what we experience on Earth. Trying to visit Venus would completly liquefy and melt any spacecraft near it.

Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth. It used to be one of the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Which facsinated many Astronomers. Venus was probably covered by many bodies of water and forms of life could have been supported, just like Earth. The planet now has a rocky surface with many valley's, mountains, and craters that makes astronomers itch to further expore it. Despite it's very hard conditions to even get near the planet.

Venus is a very cool planet. As it is very Dangerous to further study and explore,It is all worth it in the long run. The planet has very many earth-like qualities. So it would be smart to see if there was any signs of life. Venus is worth all the dangers because its a worthy pursuit.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The era of mass car usage is slowly coming to an end. Many countries around the world are implementing innovative methods of limiting car usage in their country. Although a car may seem like the logical and easier way for one to get around, there are many other less costly, and better for the environment methods of transportation. It is crucial to the future of the environment for the world to act now and use less cars. Cars produce emisions that are very bad for the ozone. If the ozone tears, radiation from the sun will penetrate the atmoshpere and severely damage the earth in which so many life formes thrive. There are countless advantages of limiting car usage that would benefit all the world in the long-haul.

New communities are rising all over the globe where car usage is severely limited and all residents are pedestrians. It may seem like a dysfunctional community but the residents actually feel to the contrary. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" without the use of cars, residents and their families feel much more content. All the resources they need are within the community and definently within walking or biking distance. This is just one of many progressive ideas that has proved succesful and very beneficial.

In other cities where polution is very high, bans on car usage are coming into place very well. Citizens are discouraged by law to operate personal forms of transportation on certain days. This came into place in Paris after the whole city was drowned in smog. Smog is the pollution exerted from cars and mixed with fog. Although some people did break the law to use their car, it worked for the most part. Many people do not realize the the effect polution has on the environment until they are able to see pshysical change. That is why the world must act now before pshysical change can be seen globaly.

Change needs to happen now. Many communities are begining to see the effects of their cares and are using them less. Cars are a trend that is slowly decreasing. maybe one day, there will be no harmful car usage. Maybe one day. Change is a' comin.",3,3,1,3,1,2,2,1,2
"There are many reasons citizens should limit there car use and help our planet. First off in the first text I read someone says when they got rid of there car it reduced some of the tenseness they had and they felt happier. Also the cities who used less vehicles wouldnt feel as tight and over whelming.

In the second text i read it gave me many statistics on how using less cars would help us. One thing they stated was they banned certain vehicle license plates for a couple days and the smog percenatge went down as low as 60 percent. Also car pooling or hybrid cars were fine because it helped the cause of less smog.

In the third source I read through it helped me understand the importance of not using your car often. They banned car usage that day besides buses and taxis which is hard to follow through especially on a rainy day so many people got finned. In the text they said its a goo dopportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. After hearing about this many other cities started joining in on the movement to help reduce pollution, which they did do. Also the park centers and pitted sidewalks have imporved tremendously.

During the last article I read it really opened my mind to riding bikes, walking or even car pooling. It talks about since the market crashed people didnt have enough money to buy cars and pay for gas. This made me think how much money you could save if you stopped driving. You could do so many other things without paying for a car and its gas money.

So overall I think we should reduce our driving because we could reduce pollution, save money and if it has to come to it you can car pool with a group of people.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"The author suggest studys that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brighest or the brightest star in the night sky, its so bright that even an amateur stargazer could spot it. Venus is alot like earth, you clould even call them twins on how similiar they are. Venus has the same density and size to earth but the differences are that venus's face is very hot and unliviable but the author thinks otherwise, he talks about how scientist are studying venus alot more than they did, and as well as talks about how NASA has a particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. Does studys show that venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents?

The first reason why venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents is Venus is righta roung the corner in space terms, people from eath sent multiple spacecraft

to Venus each mission was unmanned and for good reason, venus would destroy the space craft in a matter of hours. Thats why humans hasnt lsent a spaceship to Venus in 3 decades. The author also talks about about if

""planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even discussing furthering vists to its surface"" he also follows that up with ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may have been the most earth like planet in our solor system, long ago Venus was probably covered in water and large oceans and could have supported various life forms of life"" Venus alo has some familar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters jus like Earth. Furthermore Venus could be our safe route to and back, and also having the fastest time of getting there given the time frame of space travel.

The second reason why the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents are that The National Aeronautics and Space Adminnistration (NASA) has on particlular comnpelling idea fro sending humans to study Venus. NASA has a plan for these harsh conditions Venus might throw at us like the very hot surface, etc but Venus would allow the scientist to float above the fray and not touch the ground.Theres also unfriendly ground conditions that Venus woulkd give like the ground being 170 degrees farrenheit, and radiations that would be plentiful but surivable for humans.

The author gave out muliple reason on why its a worthy pursuit like NASA thinking about sending people to Venus and the scientist studying more on Venus like never before as well as the safeness and the time for us to get there is like notyhing else.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Would it be safe to travle to Venus or what about to colect some samples of Venus like rocks,gasses or other things in Venus? Have people wounder how is Venus and is it simliller or different to Earth? We know that Venus is a planet and that Venus is closest to Earth but some poeple might not know how danger Venus has. Has any people or a ship landed on Venus or expernece how Venus feels or looks like on ground. Is it is real worth going to Venus and expercence there conditions or find any life forms in Venus?

Venus Is a similler planet like Earth but only its density and size of the planet. Venus Is a Extreme planet, the conditions on Venus are bad, in Venus almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. The clouds in Venus are different, there clouds of highly corrosive sulfuir acid is in the atmosphere. On Venus the surface temperatuer avage is 800 degrees Fahreanheit acording to the artical. Those are some extreme temperatuers for a human and for a space craft to be stay in Venus. In Venus the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in Earth, humans or machines can not with stand the heat or pressure of the atmosphere.

Humands cant live in these types of conditions like Venus has a person can end up dead and a machien or a ship can melt. No even a space ship or human landed on Venus in these types of conditions. Samples have not even been taken like rocks or gases because of these conditions in Venus. These types of misions can be super risky to do becasue of they extreme conditions the planet has. Earth and Venus are different, Earth has less extreme conditions than Venus dose but later on NASA is trying to find ways to see how they can have protection on there spacce ships and people to try to get some samples from Venus.

This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to

Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"So imagine being able to detect how someone is feeling, if their feeling sad, mad, happy, excited, or even really furious. Tell me would you like to be told what your facial expression is by just looking into your camera or computer. Well now we got a new software that has been devolped that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software is called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" or as I like to call it the computer that decides how your feeling today as in like "" 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. Here's how it works a computer constucts a 3-D model of the face, then all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans muscles. One movment of one or more muscles is called a ""action unit"". It just reconize the movments of the facial muscles.

In my opinion i think it's really stupid or as in some people like to call it non-valuable because the company who is creating these types of softwares instead of making something more resourceful as in like making a software program that in every gun when it's passed by a metal detector it gives an alert, As in like they should put a micro chip in a gun and whenever that gun passes through a metal detecor it alerts on a computer this goes for all the schools. But instead we are making facial expressions on cameras and computer just to tell us how mad, sad, or angry we are. As I can recall it helps us with what? Oh right it helps us fix our tone and atitude.

So as in my opinion I think that the software ""Facial Action Coding System"" is really non-valuable cause instead of helping the community there making useless programs. In all cause if they could make ther facial action coding system work to be able to reconize if your happy, mad or sad I think they could be able to create a way better resourceful program maybe even better a program that could help save lives. But you know that was my opinion and maybe some people really like it, but im just saying what I think a classroom full of students would say.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Fourty-five minutes and counting wait for the traffic to move at least a fraction of an inch so I can tell myself that we're making progress.

There are many advantages from limiting your car usage, and I'm starting to believe that I should  take my own advice on that.

Source 1 states that in Vauban; Germany, residents have given up their cars. It's completely car-free, except for the main thoroughfare where the tram to downtown Freigbur runs, and a couple of streets on one edge of the community. 57 percent of the population mioved there to get rid of their cars.

"In the passage the author explans how people have had trouble getting spacecraft to survived long enough to get samples of Venus. The author tells the reader many ways that could help the spacecraft to last longer on the planet for earth's scientists can gather samples and learn more about the planet. The author explains to the reader different ways humans could live on Venus and why we should keep trying to gether information on the planet. In the passage the author strongly supports his claim that studying Venus is a worty pursuit despite the dangers.

In the passage the author states that ""NASA has one particurlarly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" making it safer for scientis to study the planet. Same as how jet airplanes fly at higher altitudes to fly over storms on Earth a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus by using simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide. These would allow the the craft to last longer on the surface and allow the scientists to gather samples from the planet to better understand Venus. Another project is looking back at computers that was used in Worl War II called mechanical computers. Using no electronical devices thes computer use gears and levers to make caculations. These computer are not delicate and can be used in the tough terrain on Venus.

In the final the author talkes about the value of of further exploring Venus. And raises the qustion of what could be gaind if we spent time gathering informaton from the planet. That human curiosity will likely guide us to many equally intimidating endeavors. And finally tells the reader that the dangers and the doubts should not limite us but to expand our limits to the edges of imagination and innovation.

In th passage the author explains that further exploring Venus is worth the risk and dangers that may come forth on the planet. the aouther explains ways that could make the trip on Venus safer and last longer for scientist to gather what they need to further understand the planet. And that we shouldn't limit what we can do and push for more and better outcomes and not be pulled down by the dangers and the doubts.",1,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,1
"If you had the choice, would you rather sit back and not have to worry about driving ever again? Or would you rather just drive normally, and what everyone is used to? I strongly believe in this sense, I believe that it isn't even worth the time to worry about this. There are many reasons why it isn't worth it such as it could be more dangerous, the cars would cost to much, that money could be going to something more helpful and better. With the price of these cars, not everyone would be having one, I would think that would just make things more complicated.

First, as they stated in the passage, there could be some sort of alert to notify the driver when they need to take the wheel. That's just the problem, I asure you some people who would be travling far, what if they are sleeping, really zoned out, or just don't understand? What if they don't take the wheel in time that could result badly. It's just an issue, people could be getting hurt, the driver. They could hit something or someone because they weren't paying attention. More so the beginners, everyone would be testing it out, getting to know the system and that isn't safe.

Next, as they stated in the article, it costs millions to go through with this change. All the money that would be going towards this, I just believe there are other things we could be using that money on. I'm positive the cars would be costing a good amount also, not everyone could get that. Just to change the roads , and get everyone started, it would just be costing so much.

Lastly, honestly what's the point? If people don't want to be driving they should just catch a taxi, or drive with other people. There's other better and more affordable options. What's the point in getting a car that drives you? It's really not helpful in anyway.

In conclusion, that's why I believe having driverless cars is really not something we need. Our society is hardly doing anything on their own now a days, and the fact that driving isn't even really that difficult. I believe it's a waste of money, it could be very dangerous, and there really is no point.",3,2,1,3,1,1,1,1,1
"Twenty five years ago NASA’s Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking photos of possible landing sites for its companion vessel Viking 2. While looking over a region of Mars called Cydonia, controllers of Viking one at the Jet Propulsion Lab were stunned to see what looked like a giant head almost two miles long from top to bottom. They quickly came to a conclusion that it was just another

Martian mesa, commom in Cydonia. Although there were some skeptics.

The “Face on Mars” became an icon. It was talked about on radio shows, it was written about in books and magazines even placed in grocery store checkout lines. Some belived that the face was proof of ancient civilizations. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact. Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist for NASA said “We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.”

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team photographed the face ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, The photograph uncovering a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. But some were not satisfied.

The Face on Mars can be found at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April ’98—a cloudy time of year on Mars. The camera on board MGS had to look through clouds to see the Face. Maybe, said some skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. Mission controllers decided to look again. “It’s not easy to target Cydonia,” said Garvin

“In fact, it’s hard work.” Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.

In all scientist uncovered that the mysterious ""Face"" on Mars wasn't a face at all, just a regular Martian mesa. Using high definition cameras and updating old pictures. it wasn't the end of a mystery or a stunting of imagination, it was the beging of a new thirst for deep space exploration.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Many people live in the USA voting for the next president, but there are people who think that the election system need to change to become better. I personally think that the election system should stay.

First off, the founding fathers created the Electoral process. The Electoral process is a simple but complex system that holds up are government. The system protects us from people accidentaly picking a leader that may end up being a tyrent or worse. Many people may say ""What about Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, or bob Dole."" Well it's vary likely that there will be more people like that if we change the system and start a new.

Even though, citizens of the USA think that the Electoral Collage is Anachronism. That statement is not true. If the Electoral collage was outdated the U.S. would the government system would have fallen awhile ago. even if there may be ties between the Electoral collage the system will have a plan B. While I'm Electoral collages the representives of the state are chosen by the people if the wrong disison was made people should balm the people who chose that person.

In the end, the people are the one to blame not the system. The system may have a few flaws but the flaws are only made by the people vote. Some one may say ""If the system was perfect there whould be no need for blame."" but nothing can be purfect.""

I think that we shouldn't change the election system",2,3,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Driverless cars sound like everybody's fantacy, you see and hear about them from everywhere; fictional movies, childrens books, television, but having a driverless car might not be the fantacy you hoped for. There are many problems that come with the driverless cars. While you may be able to get around easily, who would be at fault if technology fails and someone is injured- The driver, or the manufacturer? Surely If you were to be in an accident because the car itself malfunctions causing injuries to you and other people you wouldn't be to blame?

Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert human drivers. In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars. Why? Because it is rather dangerous. Another negative aspect would be that not everybody would agree with driverless cars, so would this cause a problem? Having normal cars and driverless cars on the streets together?

Having a driverless car will cause issues with navigating through roadwork or accidents, because they might be programmed for certian roads with certain conditions. So if something were to happen such as an accident would the car know when to stop? Or if there was an ambulance coming down the road for an emergencey, would the car know to pull over and let it pass?

Another con to the driverless cars would be that there would be so many sensors to go along with it. These types of cars need to have sensors in every direction, because there are unexpected animals, or children that cross the road without paying attention, they need to make sure the sensors are able to detect those types of things fast.

Technology is going very far but not this far yet, we might be trying to rush it too much, having only driverless cars would pretty much mean getting rid of normal cars, therefore; Many car buisnesses go out of work and many people lose their jobs. That being said, it would be way to expensive to replace normal cars with driverless cars for the billions of people in the world. While there are many benefits to this idea of driverless cars there are just as many if not more cons.",3,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys because you could go places like europe,china,greece. You could have fun and explore places also it's not hard work all you have to do is clean and feed the animals. Luke liked the Seagoing Cowboys because he could travel places he could have not gone to before he liked being on the boat. He had fun when the unloaded the animals with the rest of people on the ship he played tennis, ping pong in the animals housing. They played diffrent kinds of games that passed time but it was kinda hard working there because if it was raining hard and you had to feed the animals you would still go outside and feed them. Luke hurt himself doing that he fell when the boat was shaking and cracked his ribs but he could still walk but he had to take a brake from doing any work. There's also another reason you should join the Seagoing Cowboys you could have a chance to work as a team with other people and aboard the ship with your friend or family member or cousin.

"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" has some good points on why we should spend money on building them. It also has better points on why we should not bother buildning them. The reasons being, it is a waste of money, money we dont have, and it could be dangerous.

Making the driverless cars is not something that we need. We the people have perfectly working cars right now that we all are pleased with. We dont have enogh money to build something so outragous and unessicary. Think of all the money we would be wasting. Redoing all the road signs, the money put into the car and all its needs. Gas stations would shut down and people could lose their jobs. Some people would not even want the new fancy cars and it could be a mess with the new road signs for them. Then there is the responsibility for the accidents.

In conclusion those are the reasons pointing out why we should keep the cars that we have today. They work perectly and we do not have to spend anymore money on them. driverless cars should stay in peoples dreams, they are not meant for the roads.",1,3,0,3,0,1,1,1,1
"The technology to read the emotional epressions of students is very unecessary. i believe its unecessary because, that would be too much information to be giving a computer. a computure dont need to know students faces & emotions, its used for technology only.

The first reason why i say no because the computer already holds enough information about students like their full name, birthday, location & more. Students feelings & emotions shouldnt go on a computer. In the article, the author mentioned that the computer will study your face muscles too see if you are confused, happy, sad, etc. That would be holding too much information about a child or teen & you never know whats going on or whos waching behind tha computer screen.

Also, Its not a computers business on how a student is feelings. its a computer, not a person. its no llke the computer can do something about their emotions. Thats a teachers job with seeing how a student is feeling, not a compters.

Though it is a good idea to come up with, i will still disagree with this invention/idea. a computer should not have that much info on someone period. also, you never know who may be watching behind the computer screen.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,1
"If I were a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens, I will be brave enough to say that the Face is just natural landform, because in the pessage, it says thst what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the Amercan West. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Then, just like the passage said, I agree that the Face is just a natural landform even just the way it looks, I mean some people might be not agree with my opinion. For those who thinks it was created by aliens, I can't say that it was wrong, because it might be the right one too as well. I'm just saying that I'm in other side of their opinion. My opinion might not be right also it might not be what most of people said, but just like I said, I didn't believe that the Face was created by aliens.

Finally, I think for those who thinks the face was created by aliens, I believe their opinion could be wring, because the one who wrote the passege are the one who really research the right one. So I think that we are the one who should

agree with the passege, so that there would be no argumentative or stuff like that. I mean this is not the real arguing but it seems like it to me. Just like the question asked me to, I just wrote what I think was right and wrote stuff from passege to prove my writting. I can't prove my answerwill be right but I'm doing what the question asked me to.",1,2,3,1,0,0,0,0,0
"There's always that new thing that comes out and everyone decides that since everyone else is using it that they should join onto the bandwagon. There trying to invent cars that are driverless but they still will need assistance in certain areas. There are cars now that are able to be driven with assistance and they're perfectly fine. Making these cars is a cool idea for physically disabled people who can't necessarily drive, but for people who can drive and aren't physically disabled, it's just laziness.

I think the development of these cars isn't all that great for people who aren't physically disabled. People now, are lazy and they think that since they're coming out with cars that drive themselves, they can just be potatos and sleep while the car takes them to their destination. I, personally, don't think that's a great idea. These cars should be sold, when they get invented, to people who are physically disabled because they need more help driving than anyone else.

If they make these cars, something can go seriously wrong with the car if someone bought it. People could die from these cars if they go out of control. Driverless cars' systems could mess up and something could go seriously wrong and the company who made that car could get sued. Like it says in the passage, ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009"" meaning that if someone bought a car from Google, and something messed up and Google didn't explain the conditions to the buyer of the vehicle, Google could get seriously hammered with thered money. Companies would be losing millions and millions of dollars if these cars were to mess up.

These cars being made should be limited to very few per state. The people of the vehicles that buy the cars should have a 10 year warranty on the car. If something goes wrong and it results in death or injuries, they should get all money back and the company needs to pay for funeral expenses and hospital bills. The amount of cars per state should be at most 15 cars but they should be spread out among the state.

In conclusion, these cars should be sold to physically disabled people. People buying these cars and the vehicles going out of control could result in death and injuries. Limiting the cars per state would be a good idea. Basically, I think these cars shouldn't be made. If they do get made and getting sold, it should be sold to only physically disabled people.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely.

It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.

It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns.

Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.

No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.

The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"While being able to tell someone's emotions can be a benefitial factor, it is also an invasion of the person's privacy. Many positive ideas come with being able to see how someone is feeling in a classroom, but there are some emotions that people just don't want other people knowing about. There are many different thoughts that go through a human being's head that therefore create the emotions that are felt. Students knowing that a computure is reading their every emotional status can create a very tense feeling and that could effect how the class lesson flows. There is no value in being ale to tell how a group of students are feeling in a class room.

Negative emotions are everywhere, which means anything can happen to anybody, so people can be emotionaly unstable. If a group of students in a classroom were to know that there is a computure that is telling the instructor that there is something wrong with a specific student, it can be imbarrasing. In the text it states "" imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotion."" That statement is an correct example of why computures that read emotions would be an invasion of every student's privacy. It's also justifying reason that there is no value in being able to tell how students are feeling because it is uncalled for.

The ariticle goes into futher explaining of how the new software in these computures are helpful and benefitial. Although it might be helpful in other ways than in a classroom, it shouldn't be used to collect information on how people are emotionally feeling without permission. Even with permission, emotions are a valuable part of humans that shouldn. t be taken for granted and used to collect data or research. For the value of emotions would be lost if a computure is using a software that reads the emotional status of the students in a classroom.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,2,1
"Driverless cars can very well be benifical to our future,but those driverless cars could cause problems with consumers and the companies selling the cars.

The technology needed for making a fully driverless car is not quite in our reach, but in the near future we might have all the technology that can propel us into having driverless car. In the article it says that the cars we have now are not completely driverless and can only assist the driver. That means that drivers still have to be paying attention and take over when the car meets road work or any unexpected thing that might pop up.

If cars went driverless the driver would get bored and not pay attention to the road. Which could lead into the car having an accident. The car would have to have an added feature to it to keep the drivers attention while they are being drove by the car.

The driverless cars would have an impact on the road laws as well as people of non-driverless cars. The article says Road laws would have to be changed to cover the liability of an accident. If the road laws have to be changed due to driverless cars what would the drivers of non-driverless cars do. The driver would have to adapt to new road laws focused toward cars that drive themselves.

The technology could flat out be a bust and not co- operate with the driver or at all. The article states if the technolegy fails then the companies who made those cars would be to blame. Which could be a bankruping end to a company.

The truly autonomous car strecthes on ahead of us, but we grow closer each day is a statement from the passage that car companies should stop talking about. Driverless cars seem a to big much time and money for something that could glitch and end someones life. Driving assistance is more what should be focused towards that way the driver is in control yet is being watched closely by the car.

The driverless car can be seen as the next big benificial thing; but it could cause problem with many people and companies.",2,2,2,2,0,0,1,2,0
"Do you ever wonder how amazing it is to study another planet. Do think of all the risks it takes? Well the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick Atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon.

The first reason why it is challenging is that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide runs through Venus. In the passenge it states,"" on the planet's suface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. ""This piece is important because it gives you an example of how the temperature is really high. Plus, the perfect temperature for a human is 98.

The second reason why it is competitive is that venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions. In the article it says,"" more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" this explains how they can't be able to experiment things without there tools. This is challenging for them because they won't be able to do much. An example is that they won't be able to photograph and videograph ineffectively.

The third reason why they it is difficult is that some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in venus's suface. In the text it states, ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick but tend to be more delicated when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This shows how technology from now can't be used in venus. In order for them to use technology is that they have to use those old computers from back in the 1940's.

In conclusion, This is how the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon. Being able to explore other planets are challenging. would you risk yourself just to go to explore another planet?",3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"First things first, I cannot actually picture this type of technology in schools, let alone actualy working. People including me can easliy be feeling happy or sad or any other emotion without showing signs of it in their face. Not that I do it on purpose but it is hard to crack a smile unless I'm laughing which is rarely. Most of the time I will just have a blank face untouched by emotions so how would a computer be able to read how I'm feeling? Half the time I don't even know how I'm feeling myself. I can see this technology being installed in schools and other places only for it to wrongly tell me or others such as teachers how I'm feeling. I can picture it now, I'm sitting in silence writing an essay over something stupid such as the one I'm doing now and all of a sudden my teacher is alerted that I'm confused or bored maybe even sad a little only to have to argue that I'm in fact all right and fine. Sounds like a pain to me.

Chapter 6, line 6-8 states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" I see a point here and it would be very interesting to see if this worked on a class but I'm still unfazed. What if the computer did do just that but unknowingly to it the kids were in fact not bored or confused in the slightest? Then the lesson once taught would be changed making it harder for the kids to learn and get the knowlede they need.

Another example is in chapter 6, line 10-12 said by Dr. Huang ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computers need to understand that, too."" I'm no doctor but Huang is so he probably does have a point here. Most human communication is nonverbal and that might be true to a lot of people but do computers really need to understand our emotions because of it? I for one do communicate verbally I don't understand how else you could communicate. If i'm feeling a certain way I'll speak it if approprate. Computers don't need to know your emotions for any reason it is a computer not your significent other. If someone is on a computer they are probably working on something or killing time and goofing around none of which call for the device to read how you are feeling.

In conclusion I find the new technology quite useless and not worth the time. As interesting as it is and I would like to see it in person and test it myself, I think computers are computers and don't need to know how I am feeling. Why should it know? It's my emotions not its and I can't see it actually being able to read how I am feeling when I don't even know how I am feeling. Therefore I am against it.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Arguing whether the use of the techonology to read the emotional expressions of stuidents is good idea and is it great techonology they have invented because now you can see how other people really feel and you would not think wrong, another thing is you can also tell how the other person feel about you. Even though i think this is a great idea, some people may not like it and feel offend by this idea because no technology or computer could tell how a person is really feeling. No techonolgy is hundread percent correct.

Using this techonolgy ti read emotional expressions of student in the classroom it is valuable because when a students is feeling down or depress you would know so you could help them. Another things not much students are going to like this becuase some poeple don't like to tell people how they really feel. They don't like public to know. So it will be embrasse to them. I think using a computer to read poeple emotional would not work on everybody it's not like everyone is willing to tell the public their problem or anything.

Using the techonolgy to read emotional expressions, some people will love it because it said in the article,

""You can tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Mos of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that appear"" i agree with you can't actually tell how a person feeling just look the facial expression, using the technology it tell exacally how many percent the person is feeling so it would tell you how they are really feeling. As it say in the article ""we humans perfom this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. Having the techonolgy in an classroom is not a good idea though. Why have a technology in a classroom when you know already how a student would feel about school.

I think these kind of technology would be useful to use in thearpy or pyspath hospital because you would know exactly how a person is feeling so you can help them and make them feel better. Having this techonolgy is a geat idea but it depend where you use and not a classroom.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

"My opinion on Driverless cars? I personally do not think we should have them because, if we did then Technology would be taking over the world. What's next driveless Lawn Mowers? No, Driveless cars is a dumb and stupid idea. If we have cars that drive themselves then the world would become really lazy.

In the article it had said that they would be having ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan"" cars that can drive themselves by 2020. Just think of if that actually happened how many people would be obese and not getting exercise. Yeah driving really is not a form of physical fitness. The world is already lazy enough as it is so having cars that can drive themselves that would just make the world even lazier.

There are some positives like it could make driving safer for some people and teens that are not so good driving and how to hold their hands etc.. All in all It could go both ways it could be good and bad. I honestly seeing it ending badly but that is just my opinion. I do not think that having cars that can drive theirself is a good idea. It takes the fun out of growing up.

So what if we did having driveless cars it would take away a lot of money because then kids would not need driver ED, which cost roughly $400 to $475 and that is only some places. Other it cost as much as $800 just to even do driver ed. Just think about how many kids do driver ed and how much money that brings in. What if no one decides they want a driveless car then what? it would be a huge wast of money.

If all the reason I have provided is not enough to make people vote against driverless cars then I do not know what would. There are so many reason why there should not be driverless cars. There are some reason why there should not be driverless cars than they are why we should have them. So how about driving just stays the way it is.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Voting, one of the most American things I can thing of. This is a democracy, and we have the right to vote for our leader, but not really. There is a thing called the Electoral College, and the electors that you vote for actually vote for the president. Although this does not seem fair, it is a great system. Almost every time your state votes for an Elector, he picks the President that your state wants. So it really is a great deal.

My opponents belive that the president should be voted by popular vote, but i disagree. Richard Posner, writer for slate magizine writes that this method is non-democatic, and should be overruled(source 3, paragraph 15). Although you are not actuially voting for president, you are voting for who votes for president. This method equals out the playing field for states. Insted of all the power going to states like California or Texas. Presidents have to fight for every state. Posner also writes, sometimes the person with the popular vote will not win the election, like in 2000(source 3, paragraph 16). Although this was a huge disaster, it was the first time something like this has happened since 1888. Also, 4 years later George Bush won the election again, but for real.

Some may say that America is not filled with the smartest, or brightest people. So you belive that we should hold the fate of who will be president in the hands of an adult who cant spell his own name. Someone ike that has as much power as a guy who has watched every debate, and has done research. So by voting for a democrate elector, your state will vote for a democratic president, if your state votes in a republican elector, then your state will vote for a republican president. It is as simple as that.

The Electoral college provides a point system for every state. the biggest are California with 55, and Texas with 38. The smallest are the Dakotas, and they each are worth 3 points. The point system is based on population, and how many representitives you have. One of the best parts of this is that every state get attencion. Without this system, the candidates would only go to campien at the highest populated states. Then this would cause the smaller states to think that their votes don't matter, and then one day we are going to have a bad guy as our leader.

In conclusion, I belive the Electoral College is a great system, and I hope it lives on. Although it is not really Democratic, it still is a better system than what my oppents belive we should do. This gives us a certantity of oucome, a president that everyone supports, swing states, big states, and helps to avoid run-off elections. So Senator, if you back the Ellectoral College, maybe we will vote you as our next President.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"One of the topics in ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" was that a safer car comes from a safer driver, and that statement is pretty clear. Driverless cars are not as safe as a human driver. Cars should be controlled by a person 100 percent of the time, because a computer won't always know what the best choice is to make; our technology is not quite good enough to be extremely reliable yet; and it should not be encouraged for people to be lazy behind the wheel.

In paragraph 9, it states that the cars need human assistance when navigating bad driving conditions. When driving conditions are not ideal, a person should be in control all the time. Even when approaching a crash or construction site. This is because there might be things that a person notices, but a car might not.

A car might not pick up on things that a human would, because the cars don't have technology that is advanced enough. Technology is a fast moving world, but if the technology is not perfect, it should not be used in something as dangerous as a car. This is why new cars are getting recalled all the time. If regular cars, that use technology that is known to be reliable, get recalled then; then what would happen if new technolgy was inccorporated. There is a reason for why there are so many proccesses to go through before someone can get a license. It is mostly for young drivers to relaize how important it is to be a safe driver.

Driving is not something that people should take lightly. Driverless cars would encourage, already lazy, drivers to become lazier. It would also take the best and most reliable drivers out of the picture. If people are encouraged to be lazy behind the wheel, they won't be ready to respond when they need to. Also, if a computer is driving most of the time, and then the computer puts all the weight on a crappy driver who doesn't know what they are doing, it makes the situation even worse.

These are just a few of the many resons why driverless cars are not a good idea. This is why cars should be controlled by a person 100 percent of the time.

"Honestly, i feel very in the middle of this subject.It indeed would be nice for teachers to know when and what a stdents emotions are but,at the same time that could also be a pesonal thing. school computers should detect sadness,boredum, and or anger.On the other hand, it could be a good thing.What if the kid is very sad all day everyday?The device could send at message to the teacher so that they can talk.this could prevent a suicide and more things in that nature.

The reaon I think this is because like I said before thats not the schools buisness if im sad or happy.I wouldnt mind anyone knowing my emotions,but everyone isint me, people have different opinions and very many peopke wouldnt like that.

So I think id give my honest opinion and go with i dont know evryone isin't the same and were all human and have different opinions,characteristics ect..If it were to be in school computers i'd say you should give out a form for the sudent and or psrent to sign.Nothing like that should just be added.If this is added to school computers it Should be strongly suggested if not approved by parents.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"It would be good to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program, because it would be a great opportunity to help out, a lot of chances to go sight-seeinng, and would open up a world of awareness.

Firstly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program would give you the chance to help out. Many countries were left in ruins after World War 2, this program helps though. The Seagoing Cowboys program hires ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the animals. What better way could you help out.

Participating gives out huge amounts of help that is put to good use.

Second of all, there are lots of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke Bomberger explains, ""The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy."" Luke, like many others, got plenty of chances to go sight-seeing. Luke went from Europe to China to Greece and even Venice, there are so many places to visit, joining would be the best way to see them.

To add to that, participating would open up a great world of awareness. Joining helps bring about an awareness to people of other countries and their needs. Joining would not only be an amazing adventure, it would help with seeing other peoples point of views and how they need help.

The Seagoing Cowboys program is helpful and fun all in one, and would be the best choice to make. It may have it's downsides, but the good parts in joning, (helping out, sight-seeing, and awareness) make up for any and all bad parts.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"A 3-D computer that has been made to show the emotions of a person has been in the works. It has been tested on paintings like the Mona Lisa showing her emotions. What if schools had computers like these 3-D ones for school allowing them to be more advanced then before. I believe these computers can allow schools to raise test scores, help counsleors, and make classes more fun.

I believe that these 3-D compters could be able to help out test scores because they could tell when theres a confusing lesson or boring one. These computers could be able to detect when a student is confused on a lesson or even bored. I believe this could be helpful for teachers because they can change the way they teach there lesson in a more understanding way thus have better test scores.

My second argument on why these computers could be useful to schools is helping out kids who are scared to talk out on their probelms. I think counsleors could find a machine like this useful for students who still fear tallking to them. Not only that but these machines could help them know when kids in class are sad or angry.

My last argument is making lessons more fun. These computers can be able to see the students who find lessons or schools boring. Thus could help teachers know to make the class lessons better to have more students excited for class.

I am for schools having these computers. These schools coudl realy be more advanced then ever with them. I think they would help schools with scores, help counsleors, and make classes more fun.",2,3,0,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Despite driverless cars not being able to be absolutely driverless the vehicles still are able to do actions that human beings would not be able to do. Such as use less gas while driving, and still haul more people. Driverless cars will, in the long run, cut out the workers who drive for a living, like taxi drivers or semi drivers. Those workers may be able to still work for the company, but work on the car instead of in it. In the end driverless cars use half the fuel as a human would while driving a vehicle and use less money for the cost of gas. The conclusioin that companies would have to also think about is that employers do not have to pay their employees, who previously had to drive, as much because the drivers would not be driving anymore.

While the driverless vehicles are using les gas, that is an added bonus for the economy because the United States would have to buy less oil form the Middle East causing the U.S to have more money to pay back the trillion dollars of debt that is currently owed. Also the less fuel being put out of vehicles will help the ecosystem and the O-Zone by helping restore it and keeping Global Warming less of a threat to the world. The vehicles will be ""more flexible than a bus,"" meaning that the automobiles will hold more people, use less gas, and get places quicker and safer. The automotives will still be able to have a human driver, but only when needed. Such as in necessary times as a traffic jam, or if there is road work ahead.

The driverless cars are not just as safe or more safe than a car being driven by a person. The driverless cars have ""driven more than half a million miles without a collision."" Today so many teen drivers get into collisions with other drivers because of distractive devices. Where the are driverless carsare without a person and just a piece of technology, the technology will not have the temptation of picking up a cell phone or radio device. Also many popular car brands are making their own type of driverless cars such as General Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan who all plan of having the vehicles be sold out tothe general public.

Many American people watch television about futureistic devices and lifestyles including driverless cars. Car manufactures saw what the people wanted and decided to help make that dream become reality. Although the title says ""driverless cars"", it is not entirely true. The vehicles will still have a human opporator, but the human will not be one hundred percent involved in the driving. In the end the cars will be little to not dependent on the human att all just when there is unwanted road adviseries ahead.

Some new laws will have to come with the production of the new driverless cars but all good things must have a few boundries. Some new laws may include who will be at fault if someone gets injured if the vehicle collides with another car or pedestrian. Although right now it is unclear who will be held responsible if there is an injury or death caused from the automobile, many discussions are being thought out by the car companies. The big question of liability right now is who will be heald responsible the manufacturer or the driver? Depending on the given situation that question will remain unsolved until it can be tested out and argued on both sides.

Although some people may not believe in the idea of a driverless car, it has many more positives than negatives. The car will use less gas, helping the ecostystem and the economy. Use less money on gas, saving people many dollars on taxes and helping the U.S out of debt. Hold more people, helping people get places quicker and safer if someone is to drive. Lastly the cars have less threats of getting destracted as a normal human would. Therefore driverless cars can only help the average person by saving money, being safer, and using time more affectively.",4,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,0

"""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is an article about the positives and negatives of driverless cars. It was a very interesting topic, one of the best i've read on an Istep test. It was about how we could be seeing drverless cars in the near future. It talked about how they've tested out many options from magnets to electrical rods. The article gave facts and didn't shy from what the issues were. Now I'm going to express my opinon on the topic.

My view on driverless cars is not a set voice. I agree with their concepts and the test ran but i don't agree with how fast they're trying to market it. It's only been sixteen years since we've gotten computers and only about eight or nine since we got modern computers. The touchscreen phone is fairly new and they have these ""Hoverboards"" which are just segways without handles. I guess what I'm trying to say is there's no reason to jump to something so big if we don't understand what we have yet. I don't doubt we will have self driving cars i just doubt it'll be so soon.

I see self drving cars as something we should pursuit. I just don't think it should be a main part of our advances in technology. There's so many things we can be doing other then creating this. We should finish finding ourselves before we start building technology that doesn't need us. with all this ""machine doing"" stuff we'll just be sitting at home while the bots do everything. Thats no a world i want to live in. A world where everyone looks to machines to do their work.",1,2,1,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Driverless cars in my opinion wouldn't with the people I know in my community. This is because it would take away from the the experience of being behind the wheel of a vehical. Yes driverless cars might be safer but why should they be forced to lose something that is enjoyedable to most individuals. If states just worked as hard on enforcing and finding new ways on keeping the roads safe we could avoid the dangers of human driven cars and they could still have their experience.

Personally, I could see driverless cars as a great oppurtunity to look into because it can keep the roads safe and the person behind the wheel can do whatever they would like. Therefore they should be ready to take over at anytime. I also like this idea because the passage stated that driverless cars would take half the fuel of today's taxis. There are many positives to this but I question how well the car would be able to keep the driver awake. The passage said that the car would be watching the driver to make sure they're aware but I'm afraid that some people may fall asleep not be easily awaken. Another concern I would be afraid to get into a car that relies on so much more technology. Any of the sensors cameras could mess up or even the warning displays could go wrong. This would be a big issue for me. With those concerns i also have plenty of positives with this new idea.

The passage says that they'll have to interpret the driving fun in a new way. I think that is a wonderful thought and could possibly keep someone aware if they're into the process of being in a driverless car. Most people today love to text and multitask in the car and that can be a problem in cars which are driven only by humans. But in this case of a intergrated process would give them that option of being on devices and doing other activities becuase it would help them stay awake and could be able to take over quickly. If they find a way to make it fun and find a way to make it a enjoyable experince i think most people will be into the safer and more effiecent taxi. Overall I think this is a great idea and could possiblly be the key to keeping people safe on the roads.",2,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Dear senator,

Every one has a voice and they all want to be heard. The Electoral College is an unfair method of calculating votes for the population while voting for a president of the United States. States begin to feel like it is not worth it to vote because their vote could be neglected or it would not hardly count. Electing presidents by using popular vote gives states a better advantage at choosing their president because they know their vote is in and someone else will not be able to change their choice. Popular vote is when all the people are allowed to vote for the president and every vote counts because based on the amount of votes the president recieves from the people is who wins the election.

Electoral Colleges are when the people vote for the person they want to govern them and that vote goes to a person that could either decided to vote as the people choose, or vote for whom ever he feel should run. It lowers the peoples voices, they are unable to directly choose what they want because their choices could be changed. Electors don't have to vote infavor of the person you would like. The diffrence between the Electoral College and popular vote is that in the Electoral College their are electorrs that can choose to vote in favor of what we -the people- want if they agree with it. The elector doesn't have to choose what the people want. In popular voting, the whole population gets to choose who they want as president without worrying that their vote will be put aside. It makes sure that we -the people- get what we want. They could just change the vote and choose who they want to run as presidency. The Electoral College doe shelp the counting of the votes because there are only 538 voters; however, we are in a diffrent time where electrical machines can help calculate the total number of votes for a large population.

Citizens with the right to vote feel like it is not needed for them to vote because the have a low number of electors, while having a large number of population. It would benifit them if instead of having a certain number of electors that you have to ""trust"" and hope they vote for the candidate you are going for, they will be able to directly vote for them using the method of popular votes to chose the president. The citizens will know that their vote counts and that it can't be changed because they wont have electors voting for them.

Popular vote gives the citizens freedom and it helps to better calculate what the people want. The United States is a nation that is governed by the people and is runned based on what we want. It wouldnt make sense to deprive us from our voting rights. The constitution states that this goverment was created by the people, from the people, for the people and allowing us to vote by popular will help reinforce this because it will give us the freedom and liberty to choose as we -the people- want.",3,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Presidential election is held every after four years on the first Monday of the month November. We decide who's going to be our next leader, the President. Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be a disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College has a total of 538 electoras and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you atleast have to have 270 electoral votes and this is a good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Obama and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Obama got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romeny. Almost of every states electoral votes is on a ""winner-take-all"" basis. For every slight of pulrality in each of the states, it creates a ""landslide electoral-vote"". This means that a tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive a majority of the votes. In passage three it gave an example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in pluraity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to lead us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it migh be a disaster. Because not all of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in a huge chaos. I slightly agree with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.",3,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Driverless cars are coming, and it seems to be an amazing idea. It will be a big change for the world, and it will be here before we know it. More and more things are being discovered about how to make theses cars better and soon people will see it for themselves. Even though there are still things being worked out to make these cars even better, it seems like it is going to help out in a lot of ways. It would use half of the fuel of today's taxis, offer new safety features, and make getting places easier.

These new vehicles would consume less fuel than most of today's cars currently take. They could get you farther on less gas, making it a cheaper way to travel and get to everyday places such as work or the store. Cars like this would fundamentally change the world and how we live. By 2020, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that meet these standards out to the public. In such little time, the people could see the world and transportation changing right before their eyes.

Even if certain vehicles do not function completely driverless, they do offer new safety features that would help in a lot of ways. In some cars, such as the ones built by BMW who developed the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013, they can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but the driver must still have both hands on the wheel at all times for it to do so. These kinds of vehicles also require for people to take the wheel at certain times such as driving through work zones and around accidents. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they will notify the driver if human skills are needed, so the driver must remain alert at all times. Companies such as GM have developed seats that will vibrate to get the driver's attention, but they are also considering things such as flashing lights on the windsheild to warn a driver if they need to take over. The idea of having cameras in the cars so the car can watch if the driver is keeping focus on the road or not have come up as well. Many different safety features are developing with the research of driverless cars.

Getting where you would need to go would be easier in a driverless car from one of the public transportation systems that Google cofounder Sergey Brin has imagined. If would be less worrying as well for some people. If somebody goes out and drinks, then they cannot get behind the wheel of a car. However, with the driverless cars, the car would do all the work to get them home safely and with no hassle. It would be safer and more efficient in an event like this. As research and development of new technologies for these continue, it could begin to help in situations such as this. It would make a lot of people's lives easier and maybe even save a few. With the technology, it could help prevent accidents and keep the people in the car safer with minimal human control of it unless needed.

As we wait to see what happens in the next few years, it is interesting to look more into what an amazing and brilliant idea driverless cars would be. They are quickly becoming more of a reality. The world continues to change and develop right in front of everybody's eyes. These will change how a lot of things happen and how a lot of people get around from place to place. New ideas like these can lead to safer and more efficient ways of traveling. It could help out in everyday life, or if you are taking a trip somewhere and do not want to have complete control the entire time so you can relax.",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,1,3
"Driverless cars can be a good thing. If we have these cars and they are made so we dont have to have to steer. There are many good reasons why we should have these cars and fund them. In the next paragrah i will explain why i feel that reason for you.

What would it be like with driverless cars? The world today would need something like this because then there wouldnt be any crashes as bad as there is. Yes as of right now why would people want a driverless car that needs a driver still? Well if we put are money and the best people we have one it we will make the would a better place. If we make it so that all us humans would have to do is sit in the passanger seat, we would make it a safer place to walk,driver,ride bike, and/or doanything.

We can make the BMW life savers. We wont have many texting and driving,talking on the cellphones while driving. The driving world as we know it will never be as safe as it will be with driverless cars. Yes not many people could buy it because it cost alot of money but they wont care because those peoples kids can walk the streets anthey wont worrie about the kids getting hit or anything.

When we get driverless cars will there be many car crashes?? The answer to that question is no. With the driverless cars they will have sensors that will make the car brake before hitting the other car there for; it will be much safer with driverless cars. If people think this is a bad idea they are wrong and dont understand how safer this will be for everyone.

I am all for the driverless cars with everything i have. Driverless cars will make the world a much safer place. Yes it needs some more work to become fully driverless but we can and will make this happen. We will make the world a safer place and a much more relaxted place.",2,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Electoral College

Dear Senator of the state,

I am a former citizen of the state writing to you about my regards of changing the electoral college system. The electoral college should have it's own individual vote to the president. It is unfair that the vote of the people goes towards electors who then decides whom to elect the president. Also, what happened the power of the people? The citizens of the state who vote for an elector does not have the control of who they elect which president that is elected.

I suggest that the votes of the people are sent to the electoral college, then the electors vote upon the two presidents. After that, the votes between the two presidents are seperate, while the one vote goes for the president of their chosen and the other vote goes towards the other president of their chosen. This process would make everything fair and the majority of the vote doesn't just counts as state.

Sincerely, consirened Citizen",0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Many people believe that driverless cars would be a good idea. They believe that is would help drivers be more safe while driving because their car would be in charge of the driving and the person behind the wheel would have no control, unless they wanted it. Scientists believe it would prevent more car wrecks and other accidents that have to do with cars. Driverless cars are a good idea.

The text states, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" Many believe that driverless cars could save us from more wrecks and other kinds of accidents because the car could react faster that the person in control of the car. The car could handle everything from backing up, pulling in, maneuvering through traffic jams, going up and down hills, and just driving across town. These cars would make everyday driving routes a lot more safer for everybody.

These cars would also have an off option. The text states, ""Some manufactureers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" The driver could turn the auto drive on when they are tired and do not want to focus as much on the road. They would put their lives in the cars hands. But also, they could turn the auto drive off so they can be in charge of the road. Usually people would do this when they are in traffic and are ranging speeds from ten to thirty miles per hour. The the person might feel safer because they are in charge of where they go and how fast they are going.

The way these cars would work would be by sensors in the roads and on the front, or under the car. The sensors would tell the car what is ahead and what the car or the driver should prepare for. The text states, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof."" All of these things are what helps the car keep the passengers safe and the other people that are on the road safe too. Sensors have came a long way since the 1980s. After about ten years, the sensors have grown tremendously. They are capable of so much more now that they are more technologically advanced.

Some do belive that these cars are not a good idea. These cars could be very expensive. They would have brand new technology. Also, the safety of the cars are a big question. The text states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a big question. The car could make a mistake because of a glitch or something else, and it could cause you to be involved in a wreck. The cars are supposed to prevent these types of things, but you never know with technology.

Self driven cars are soon to be forgotten. Scientists are working hard everyday to advance the technology we have to make the roads and other places safer for all. These cars could save people all the way from life threatening wrecks to hitting our trach can while backing up out of your driveway. These cars are going to be the next big thing.",4,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"For technology to be able to read the emotional expressions of students would be very beneficial . Some students could struggle with verbally expressing their emotion's making it hard for their teacher/learning coach to know the most successful way to teach them. Therefore if the student starts to get bored, anxious, or confused the computer could pick up on those emotions and make changes to the student's learning lesson to help get them back to focus and engage with their learning . ''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, ""Dr. Huang predicts. ''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. ''

Mental illness is on a rise amongst people in general, Students suffer from it too they're not indestructable or working machinces.

Technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is very valuable it could help students to feel less stressed when working on a lesson they struggle with , without the panicky feeling of having to talk to the teacher about it infront of the class which could cause anxiety . With a majority of communication being nonverbal it can be hard to understand even for humans , technology being able to pick up on it would be alot easier and not feel as intrusive as the student having to explain themselve to the teacher/learning coach. ''Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,'' notes Dr. Huang. ''So computers need to understand that, too''.",2,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The natural landform on mars which is called Face, is most definetely natural and with facts it can easily be proven. Such as the original picture that saw the face was all the way back in 1976. Also the camera was so old the pixels it produced we 43 meters per pixel according to paragraph 10 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars. One more thing that proves that it was just a landform is that if it was an alien artifact, NASA would most definetly have got a good picture on the cloudless day in 2001.

First off, the technology back in 1976 may have been good for the time, but that technology didn't even compare to the picture in 2001. When you look at the difference in the pictures, you can easily tell the 1976 camera was simply not a good camera and simply couldn't take very good pictures. This was most likely why it looked like a face in the first place because the camera did not get a good picture; which in turn made it not look like what it actually was; a natural landform.

Some people might argue the fact that the picture was clear enough to tell it was a face, but that is simply not true. Think about trying to take a picture of something big, but your camera only gets 43 meters per single pixel. It would look like a bunch of colors blurring together. That is what happened with the 1976 picture from the Mars Global Surveyor. The colors blurred together causing the picture to look like a face. Also the human mind has an instinct to distinguish faces from pictures and in our daily life. That instinct is another big reason why people think it looks like a face, even though it is just a natural landform comparable to a mesa.

Lastly, and the best reason, is if there really was aliens, NASA would definetly have got a good photo in 2001. In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" in paragraph 11 it states "" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that nothing was close to it and there was no sign of transport or living quarters. More than likely if something had built a statue there, there would be some type of housing or transport nearby.

In conclusion, there is no 100 percent proof for either side,but evidence leans strongly towards that it is a natural landform. This is why you should also belive that it is not really a face, but you should believe it is a natural landform. There is much more evidence and basic scientific proof that is a landform, and was not created by aliens.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. I do not believe this claim. I believe that the Face is just a natural landform that was not created by anything but the land itself.

There are many pieces of evidence proving that the Face is just a natural landform. First, and probably the most obvious, the Face is only seen at a certain angle, due to the shadowing around the landform. In paragraphs one, two, and three the author states numerous times how the ""unusual shadows...made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In paragraph eight, the author states ""the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude...."" Second, the first picture of the Face was taken in 1976, meaning that the Face could have been a result of the poor camera quality back then. The scientists at NASA back in 1997 even wanted to take another picture to see if the Face was just a natural landform. When the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of the same landform in 1998 with improved camera quality, it showed that it was just a natural landform. In 2001, scientists took a third photo proving the Face was just a natural landform. In paragraph 1, the author states ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet...when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" In paragraph seven, the author states ""...his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" and ""...anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared... revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" In paragraph twelve the author states ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West."" The Face was also used as a way to entertain the public and shine more light onto Mars. At the end of paragraph three, the author states ""the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" These claims and evidence to support them are just a few pieces of proof that the Face of Mars is a natural landform.

Some people believe the Face on Mars was made by aliens, and that there is alien life on Mars.

"Can you image cars that do not need a driver. I can, driverless car are being made as we speak. Driverless cars can help the enviroment by using less fuel. Driverless car can reduce the amount of crashes happening on roads.

The positives of having Driverless cars are not worring about the driver, it can use less fuel or it can cause less crashes on road. It can help stop a lot of pollution or just stop getting materials to make a car. The smarter car have sensors to indicated what is around them. In 2013 BMW announced the development of 'Traffic Jam Assistant. The car has special touch sensor to make sure that the driver keeps hold on the wheel. Driverless car can help people get safely to their desintion because most crashes are because people are texting and driving.

This is why I believe that driverless cars are needed in our world. Driverless car can reduces the amount of crashes. They can help poeple get safely to place. They can help reduce stress while driving. Driverless cars are the future for our world.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I will be informing you about why people should join the Seagoing Cowboys program, if anyone had the opportunity.

Some reasons people should join the program is because people can save life's. A lot of countries need help and it's not very much people to help them. Anyone can make a difference in the world. It doesn't always have to be people you help, it could be animals too. You would be able to travel the world, go places some people have never even heard of before. Luke Bomberger says, ""I'm grateful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.""

Luke Bomberger traveled to, New Orleans, Greece, Europe, China, Venice, and, Italy. That's all over the world. Would you want to travel to all of those places if you had the chance?

Luke had a awesome experience being a Seagoing Cowboy. He got to see the world in different ways. If someone called you to invite you to the Seagoing Cowboys program would you go, or would you pass the opportunity?",1,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,1
"The use of the techonology is not valuable in a classroom because students may not want anyone to know how they feel. Students should be able to keep their emotions to themselves if they do not wish to share them. Students shouldnt have to walk in class and automatically tell a teacher or a peer how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions are something a student might not want to share because they might be going throught something personal thry dont want anyone to know about. In paragraph three Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" then later on in the paragraph he says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion and communication..."" So if humans don't communicate their feelings to eachother then they probably don't want a computer to communicate them. Some people may say that that would be a good thing for students because it might help them open up more, but it would just force them to say how they feel because their emotions are already known. Emotions should be privite unless the person wants to share them. Students shouldn't be forced to share their emotions because a computer is there caculating them for everyone to see.",1,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The future is in the present. What seemed like a mere dreaming is now coming to life! New techology has helped with many advances today, for example smart cars. This concept is fairly new, but it has already sprouted problems. These dilemmas are complex; therefore, the world is still not ready for driverless cars.

Throughout the years many companies have tried to make this new idea happen, yet it is a new concept. ""For example, in the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. ... These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" This shows that driverless cars are not a smart idea. Now a days people want something pratical and fast: smart-road systems are niether pratical or quick, because it would be expensive and it would take time for the roads to be upgraded. Once they saw the expensives it would take, they let go of the idea. After this idea of smart-roads epicly failed, other came up with the idea of smart cars.

Even though smart cars have been effective, they are still not able to drive themselves. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents,"" smart cars have programs to assists the driver,not to drive themselves. Humans will still have to be alert on the road, so it will not going to help the driver. What is the use of cars that can drive themselves, if when the driving conditions get tough humans will be needed?

Another important issue (if these driverless cars come out), is who will be to blame for if an accident happens- the ""driver""

or the company? Because the person in the car will be assisting the car, the car should be to blame for. Since the smart cars are made to drive themselves, then all people involved in the accident would be victims.

Due to the information, it is safe to say that driveless cars are yet to be imereged into today's life. The people of today spend most of their day doing something, in my opinion they are ready to do nothing. Is one going to enjoy this break, though- maybe not, becasue though they are just passagers the car might need assists? Therefore there is no need for cars that will get only part of the job done.",2,3,3,3,0,1,2,2,1
"There are many reasons to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. For example you can travel on a boat and explore many new places. You also get payed so when you get home you have money for everything you need. It's a great opportunity for your family and you. You could help your family with bills, food, clothing, and many other materials.

The job also wouldn't be hard if you already know how to feed and water cattle. You wouldn't be doing your job every second.You do have to feed them two or three times a day.You also have to clean the stalls, paragraph six states this. When your done doing your job you have free time to do games and look at the ocean,paragraph eight has this included. You're also not alone you can make friends with whoever works there. If you work as watchman you have to check all the animlas each hour.

This program could help with your future, you could be asked to do the same job on a diffrent ship with a diffrent crew. Or you could be asked to do something that pays more. However you could be watchman instead of caring for the animals.

There are some cautions that could lead to danger. When it get's rainy the ladder can get slippery and you want to be careful to not fall off the ship. Paragrapgh seven includes this information.

It would be great for you to join this program! Anyone is welcomed to join at an acceptable age. Any job you do, you will get payed. The trips could take long but the longer they are the more you get payed. Join the program if your looking for a job that can support you needs.",3,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,1
"In the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author talks about the pros and cons about exploring Venus. The story tells us how it would benifit us if NASA would spaceships with humans inside but also the dangers of human kind even getting close enogh to even touch it. The author says how exploring Venus will help us or how it will hurt human kind.

In the story it tells how exploring Venus will give us benifts and how it will help us. The expolration of Venus can help becuase Venus almost has the same density and size of Earth. This is told in paragraph 2 when it states ""Earth, Venus, and Mars our other plantary neighbor"". What this means is that we can when the technoly allows us we will be able to travle to one of the neighboring plantets. but however it's not always sun shine and happiness because Venus can have cons too.

In the story it also talks about how moving to Venus can have a negative affect. Exploring Venus is almost imposible because on the planet surface the temperatures can go above 800 defrees fahrenheit which means that you would burn alive is you git too close. This is said in paragraph 3 when it says ""these conditions are far mor extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" What this means is that even getting close to Venus will be extremely hard to pull off.

In conclusion travling to Venus will help us or how it will hurt human kind. But even a small glance up close on Venus will be somthing to celibrate about. As soon as humans are able to be that would be one big achevment.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Technology that can read emotions can be valuable in a classroom. This technology can change people's lives by giving them a better chance to understand something if they are stuggling. It can also help out many students that are afraid to speak out.

The Facial Action Coding System would be useful in a classroom because it'll enable students to be taught according to there needs. In the passage they claim ""...it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The technology can also be useful for students too embarresed to talk about something going on in their lives that need attention. They also claim ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Meaning it can also tell when a student is sad and they can get the help they deserve.

In conclusion, this technology has alot of potention in the future to revolutionize education for students. From knowing when they need help or they dont understand something, this tech will adapt to their needs.",1,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,2
"The topic of driverless cars is highly debabated today, and will continue to be in the near future. Each side has many pros and cons that they can bring to the table but I believe that there is one argument that is bettere than the other. I believe that driverless cars would not serve a significant purpose in our society today for many reasons.

The name driverless goes to tell that a human would not need to operate the vehicle. This is not true, in fact driverless cars can not yet function without a human behind the wheel. These cars cannot handle driving in things like road construction or avoiding an accident. These cars can drive on the roads if traffic is not a big issue, or if there is not any construction or detours that need to be taken, but if you live in an area where these things are common, it would simply not be wroth your money to purchase one of these vehicles.

Another reason that i do not support driverless cars is that driving one of these cars could cause more accidents than there are right now. if the operator of the car is not paying attention to their surroundings, and the car cannot handle a certain situation an accident is almost certain to happen. Also, in the case of an accident that is caused by the technology, who is at fault, the driver or the car manufacturer? New laws wouold have to be implemented to solve daunting issues like these. Things like insurance companies would have to also adapt to these new cars hitting the road by devising new policies for the people that own a technologically advanced car like these.

Another reason that i am against driverless cars is that these cars could potentially take away thousands of jobs. If driverless cars can replace taxi drivers, thousands of people will be put out of work. These cars may be good for long road trips, but they are not as good as navigating big city traffic as a human is. Humans can make quick decsions and may be able to avoid these accidents. Plus, there is often road work being done, and can stretch on for miles, and humans can handle route changes and detours better than technology.

These are many reasons that humans are better suited to drive cars. Technology will continue to advance, and will get smarter, but will it be safe enough to use without someone overseeing it to make sure that no mistakes happen? This is why I believe that humans should continue to drive cars, and not technology.",2,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Technology all around us is evolving, we're now to the point where we can tell how exactly Mona Lisa was feeling when her famous picture was painted. Due to new technology such as, the Facial Action Coding System, professionals can tell exactly how someone is feeling in a picture, or even in class during a lesson. This new application will have a massive impact on how teachers educate kids. This will help out teachers with how to teach a lesson and improve how engaged kids will be in class.

First, classroom computers could use this program to recongnize when a student is confused or bored. The computer would then modify the lesson so the student will hopefully become interested again. This program could really get kids to learn and become interested about what is being taught. This would ultimately lead to higher passing rates and better futures for kids.

Secondly, this technology can make video games or video surgery alot more expressive. Some faces in videos are really bland and boring. If the faces were better detailed and more expressive the viewer will be interested and will pay more attention. Expressions on animated faces are really important, these features draw the viewers attention and will interest them.

All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom. It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are. Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them. This application will help out teachers tremendously and could really improve passing rates!",2,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"If professors were able to read their students emotions through their facial expressions from a computer, it would very well help the students in the long run and the teacher to make improvements. This kind of technology will help students and teachers form a better trust, help make teaching improvements, and learning improvements. A computer able to do that, will be valuable to all teachers and to those who want to better their education.

Even when someone fakes an expression, the zygomatic major and the risorius (facial muscles) will tell so. If a student were to perhaps lie after being confronted for cheating, the computer would be able to read his facial expressions and tell if it is geniune or not. With a computer reading yours and others facial expressions daily, it may help the classroom build a better trust with eachother. The computer will tell their true emotions, even when some try to hide it.

When the professor is teaching something that the students may not understand, they will be confused. Sometimes the teacher is so deep into the learning lesson, they will not realize when some students are not understanding. A computer will help by reading their facial expressions and send a message to the teacher explaining so, then they can realize they either need to slow down or go over it again. This helps the teacher understand the progress of where their students are at and how to better their teaching.

When a subject has caused students to grow bored, the computer will send a message to the teacher and he may make it more interesting, or change it up a bit. Said by Dr. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communications.."".

Sometimes students will not raise their hand when they have a question or are confused to avoid making themselves look foolish for not knowing. The teacher may take in consideration from the message sent from the computer that he needs call out on those students, getting them more involved. This will help shy students better their learning possibilities.

In conclusion, technology that is able to read facial expressions and tell how that person is feeling will improve all learning schools. The technology helps build a stronger trust, since the technology makes it impossible for people to hide their emotions. It will also value students and teachers, helping improve their learning zones.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,3
"I am against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. The technology is something that for a couple of years before has evolve, and it is very advance right now; but it's not 100% dependable because is not perfect. Like the article said, ""people can imitate another person's expression. I don't think that a computer is going to read someone who don't show his feelings. In my opinion it is not dependable and it is unusable.

I'll want to test one of that computers to know if that really works, but like I said, it is not dependeble. The technology is advance but it is hard to believe that a computer can read all your emotions exactly like they are. Dr. Huang said that computers need to understand that most of the human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. I don't think a computer is going to understand somthing like that.

I'm against because the technology is not 100% dependeble; technology is very useful but not very fiable. Some people can just do fake emotions and the computer is going to read it like normal I think. In my opinion it is not a good idea to use it with students, they just can express theirselfs by talking and telling what they like or what they not.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1

"Dear Mr. Senator:

Lately there's been a problem regarding electoral colleges. Some people are in favor of them; others not so much. I agree with the latter; electoral colleges are anachronistic and should no longer be used in this day and age.

In this modern era, people are being more aware or more educated about the going-ons in government. As a result, it is becoming no longer necessary to have others vote in place of the people's choices. Instead, people should be able to vote directly for their chosen leaders and not have to worry about an elector making a last minute decision to vote for another.

Those who are in favor of electoral colleges are wrong about keeping them. In only half-way allowing people to vote for president, it could also be viewed that the people were never really given a choice. Their votes are at the mercy of the electors.

If you are wise Mr. Senator, you'll choose to do away with electoral colleges. By doing so, you give people more choice and control over their decisions. I hope you'll put your foot down on this matter and refuse to have anything to do with electoral colleges because they're not helping the future of our country,

Sincerely,

"Driverless cars offer a glimpse of what we could have in the future.

Transportation as a whole would be greatly influenced by the introduction of autonomous navigation and driving systems for everyday use.

Driverless cars offer benefits that human-drivin cars simply cannot.

Machines are much less likely to commit errors than humans.

Autonomous cars can tackle many of our problems today, and are a promising technology that we must develop to better our lives and the world.

Through reduction of the threat of distracted driving, compensation for natural human errors when driving, and improvement of our public transportation system, Driverless cars can change our world for the better, and they offer a vast improvement on human-driven cars today.

Distracted driving is a major problem today that can be remedied through the use of driverless cars.

Today, a large percentage of automobile accidents in America occur due to a form of distracted driving.

However, self-driving cars can fix this.

When one is too intoxicated to drive themselves, or even too tired to drive properly, driverless cars eliminate the risk they pose to other users of the roadway by preventing them from driving with impaired judgment.

Machines can take over when the human driver isn't completely focused on the driving at hand and can correct major errors.

When it comes to texting, driverless cars are just as vital.

According to the article, some manufacturers want to bring heads-up displays with entertainment and information systems.

This would allow somebody to text while still having their eyes on the road.

Furthermore, they would be able to have the car drive for them while they were busy with their distractions.

Autonomous cars would prevent the many thousands of deaths each year that occur due to distracted driving.

Natural human errors are always present when driving, and autonomous cars can fix them before they become a problem.

Humans have a slow reaction time compared to machines, or make rash decisions.

If a human-driver were trying to parallel park, it would be very hard to get a full understanding of the situation without automated driving.

According to the article, GM has created seats that rumble when the vehicle is about to back into an object.

This helps remove any errors from driving since a driver who didn't have an self-driving car would not know that there was an object to the rear and would then commit a major error.

Machines can process information much faster as well, so if human reaction time is too slow, machines can take over to stop a car, or prevent it from harming anyone.

Humans are error-prone creatures, but driving can be error-free through the use of driverless cars.

Autonomous cars can improve our public transportation system and allow for easier transport anywhere.

According to the article, Sergey Brin, the cofounder of Google (now Alphabet), believes that fleets of public-transport driverless taxis would be able to reduce fuel consumption and be more flexible than existing systems.

This is important because public transportation is very inefficient today.

Often, cities don't have underground subways, and must rely on buses to get around.

Buses are highly inefficient because they have set routes and are inflexible.

Driverless taxis could be ordered to pick up passengers at a certain location and drop them off at another.

This is much more convenient and efficient for consumers since they don't have to do much walking while trying to look for a bus stop.

Driverless taxis would also allow for long-distance public transportation.

Today, trains have the same problem of buses in that they have set routes and they are hardly funded.

With public-transportation driverless taxis, customers can travel long distances and reach destinations in a much more convenient and efficient way than current transportation systems allow.

Public transportation would be greatly improved through the introduction of driverless cars.

Driverless cars offer a variety of benefits including improvement of our current public transportation system, accounting for and reducing human error on the roadways, and eliminating the risk of distracted driving affecting other roadway users.

Human driving today is an inefficient and dangerous task that can be better performed by machines.

Automation can be more precise than humans ever can, and it is only natural to apply this to driving.

Automated driving can improve all of our lives only if we make progress in developing the technologies to better our future.",2,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,3
"Driverless cars can be undeniably dangerous, but they have the ability to be safe as well.

With the developement of autonomous vehicles there are less drunk driving accidents and less reckless driving accidents.

With more and more teenagers learning to drive and getting their license the number of reckless driving accidents from teens have skyrocketed over the last five years.

As well as the increased risk of drunk drivers, which is always a problem but even with those risks taken care of; the car itself has some serious safety issues and economic issues.

With the American economy always fluctuating from good to bad this new developement could end up causing a huge disadvantage in some of our lower class citizen workers.

""...a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system""(1).

However with that in mind the ammount of low income jobs, such as the taxi drivers, would end up erraticated would be to large to count and more americans could quite possibly fall below the poverty line once again.

Also the article states that right now there is no such thing as a driverless car but a driver assitence car.

These cars can drive by themselves 90% of the time, except in special circumstances like road construction and accidents.

With cars like this they still require an aware driver at all times and the car needs a way a communicating with the driver when to take over.

""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in daanger of backing into an object.

Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays""(7).

However with these warning systems in place they should help the driver but instead these warnings could scare the driver.

What if a drunk man was in the drivers seat because his car can drive on its own so he believed it was safe, but he is told to take over by his vibrating chair.

WIth that man not being in his right state of mind in a special situation, such as a cinstruction zone or accident where you are suppose to be extra careful can cause more harm then good.

Finally there is the problem of eventually if there is an accident with a driverless car because the systems failed, who would be at fault the passenger in the car or the manufacturers.

That is the question everyone is asking for when these autonomous cars are used in our everyday lives.

Now autonomous cars have both their advantages and their disadvantages but they are the future wether we like it or not.

The future is full of improvement adn failures; and however this one comes out, and improvement or failure, it is still being aimed for to improve our future.

The autonomous car is ineveitable for our future, however don't be afraid but instead be prepared for the outcome whether it be good or bad.",2,2,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"As I was reading the article "" Driveless Cars Are Coming"" I was thinking this can't be serious. This article was about smart cars and how they will improve. The article talks about how people that "" drive"" them will no longer need to pretty much drive, the cars will do it for them.

They claim it is still safe or even safer than a human driving but we have to think about cases that randomly occur, like someone that doesn't have a smart car running a light. What if it isn't your turn to drive so you see the car coming last minute but your on autopliot so you can't save a life or perhaps your own. The article gives a description about the features of the car. For instense one car, a Toyota Prius has position sensors on the left rear wheel, a video camera for tracking distance from other cars, and an inertial motion sensor etc. They claim that their cars are safe and only improving, but we should'nt add on to all the accidents, we already have so many a year and having to deal with technology gone wrong will not help us only hurt us.

I am currently against this development because I don't think it is a good fit or will add any good. The first reason I am against these cars is because in the article it says ""laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" also says, "" if the techonolgy fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer""? these quotes show a strong idea of how much manufacturers care about the safety of people using their cars... not very much. They were implying that if an accident case acurres and someone is injured because of their technology messing up , they should'nt be held accountable. That is insane , they should take the responsiblity for what their product has done.

To conclude I am against driveless cars because they will create more issues, disadvantages than advantages. The smart cars aren't very safe and people that drive them are more prone to accidents from small altercations that may occur on the road. Also if you purchase a smart car and happen to get in an accident the manufacturers will not be liable, even if it is because of their cars.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,2,1
"Hello, This is Ruby from scientist at NASA. I wanted to talked about the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" that it was created by aliens. First of all, I don't think it's a natural landform becasue it just can't be. So, that mean the unmasking was created by an aliens.

For this argument, I come up with three reasons for that. My first reason is, how can the unmasking face can be natural landform?The answer is, it was created by

an aliens.""How do you know?"" Even other scientist said

that the unmasking face was natural landform I still think it's from the an alien. My secod reason is, the unmasking face look like a human face so the point is the aliens might look like human,us. We don't know if it is a natural landform or not. So, it can be but the only reason for that is, it was created by aliens. My last reson about the unmasking face is, natural landform can be but there's no provement for that .

In conclusion, I wanted to tell you that

the ""Unmasking the Fcae on Mars"" is created by an aliens. Why? because that's the only way there's an unmasking face. I'm positive that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was created by an aliens.",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The concept of a driverless car seems very interesting and even mind-blowing. There could be many ways that the world could benefit from the development of these cars, but thinking deeper into it, these cars could also be quite a problem. Technology is not always the most reliable source. Having a self-driving car based on technology will not always be reliable either. Sometimes, things malfunction, and if these cars are self-driving becasue of technology, these cars will most likely malfunction as well. Therefore, I do not support the manufacturing of driverless cars.

Regardless of still being able to take control of the car, drivers may still find it hazzardly to be sitting in a piece of metal and technology and just rely on that to get them where they want to be. If the car malfunctions, and the person inside the car gets injured, it would not be their fault, nor the other people driving on the road with them. Most likely, it would the be the manufacturer's fault because of faulty design or poor assembly. Example of a malfuntion of these cars could include simply losing its directions. Sitting in a car that has no idea where it is going could be scary. Though the driver could take control if need be, this would still be concering if the driver was not paying attention, and therefore arriving at a place they did not want to visit. Even if the car could be perfected, there is always the thought of bad weather and icy roads, or roadblocks and accidents. Again, taking control could be an easy solution, though one not might have the time to do so.

Driverless cars still would need a lot of work. They would need to be tested over and over again, even if nothing is wrong with the car to enusre safety. It would have to be tested in different weather conditions and different roads with accidents and roadblocks on them to test the feature of letting the driver take back control of the car. There very well could be fewer accidents with these cars, but problems can come with solutions. While self-driving cars is a wonderous idea, I believe there are still too many risks. Today's technology is getting to the point where it is very possible, but technology will always be technology; there will always be some kinks that need to be fixed.",2,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,2
"For years, the United States has been mass producing and using cars. It may sound surprising, but America has already reached its peak when it comes to buying cars (source 4). More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefits of using alternative means of transportation. Places such as Vauban, Bogata, Paris, and even New York have implemented programs to encourage the limitted use of cars. The idea of giving up such a comfort may sound tragic at first, but reducing car usage has many advantages.

We use cars everyday for pretty basic purposes. To get to work or school or to run errands are just a few examples. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a bus or ask for a ride from somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the past tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reasons. Maybe friends or family are not willing to give rides. Maybe the sheer thought of walking a mile may seem terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason is probably that having a car is just too convienant, it seems that there is no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and should be adjusted to fit into these sources of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their cars in favor of a life without them (source 1). I just proves that contrary to popular belief, cars are actually not a neccesity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycles when they need to go someplace (source 1). It's almost needless to say this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most car-owners in the United States! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are these people in better physical shape, but one mother, Heidrum Walter, tells us that when she had a car, she was always tense, but now that she has given it up, she seems happier (source 1). Carlos Arturo Plaza, in Bogata, Columbia, says that using his bike on their annual no-car day reduces his stress levels. There is a direct corrolation between physical activity and mental well-being. The more activity, the better you feel. By limitting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that comes in place of it, making us a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage is to protect our enviroment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuels, we are both running out of this resource and posing the threat of spills and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we use to fill our cars certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, spills can be devasting to the ecosystem it impacts, as we have seen in the past, for example the BP oil spill. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we use to fill our cars is the air pollution it leaves behind. Transportation is the second leading source of emissions in the US, behind power plants (source 4). Also, in Paris, the smog from automobiles got to be so bad that they set laws to ban cars on certain days (source 2). Just by reducing car usage for a few days, the smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they spend driving in their cars, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the years, we Americans have grown accustomed to relying on cars for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. As a community, we need to open our eyes and see the changes happening around us. Cars are not a neccesity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it is neccesary for us to cut back, for the sake of our health and our environment. It may take some getting used to, but I promise, it is more than possible. In the words of Bill Ford, we can soon move forward to a world where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, and improve saftey."" (source 4).",4,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"In my position, driverless cars is something I am against and something that I will not use in the future. I am against the idea of driverless cars because of many specific reasons. There is also the joy of learning how to drive and learning from our mistakes on driving. Maybe someone wants hack your car and it will just stop out of no where. There are also good reasons to have a driverless car for you to own. Those are some reasons I have on why I am against or with driverless cars.

Somewhere there is always a person that wants to do or cause bad things. Maybe this person wants to stop all the cars from working while they're in traffic. They can also cause a crash with 2 or more cars. Then people would just end up in the hospital. There is always a person like that, so that is one reason why I against driverless cars.

There are also good reasons to have a driverless car for you to own. Maybe you're in an accident and you need to get to a hospital and you can't drive, well then you can have your driverless car drive for you. Someone may have a child on board and they might need a diaper change or they need something, well you can help your child while your car drives for you. Say you're about to crash and your driverless car saves you with the sensors it has. There are some good reasons to have a driverless car as well.

In conclusion driverless cars is a no for me but there is also good reasons. Such as a hacker, hacking your car ans making you crash and ending up in the hosptial. There is a good reason too is for when you're in accidents. Last is the joy of learning and driving a car. This is why I am against driverless cars.",1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Although many people think that the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, I believe that it's just a landform. Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.

Before the team at NASA spotted the ""Face on Mars"" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.

Although the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.

Lastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.

Considering that before the NASA team spotted the ""Face on Mars"" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars. Plus, with the extremly high quality camera that the team used, and the enlarging of the picture I believe that this is an extrodinary landform, alothough some prefer to assume differently.",2,4,2,0,0,0,1,0,1
"Some think that driverless cars are in our future. Others think that driverless cars are, and should stay, merely a product of science fiction. I believe that driverless cars are not a good idea. Driverless cars are not a good idea for several reasons. The first and most obvious reason is safety. A second reason is the large cost of manufacturing these cars. And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself.

The first reason that society does not need driverless cars is safety. Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors. However, some of these problems are easy to prevent now. It is illegal to drive under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The simple solution is not to do it. Most crashes caused from simple driving mistakes could be prevented as well. The problem is the driver, not the car. In addition, driverless cars would be at an increased risk for technolgical malfunctions causing potentially fatal crashes. As of right now, the technology in driverless cars is only experimental and theoretical. It would take many years to iron out all the bugs, so to speak, to make these cars function properly all the time. As mentioned paragrpah nine of the article, in most of the Unites States, it is illegal to test drive driverless cars. It is illegal for these very reasons. It is illegal because experimenting with that kind of technology is dangerous.

A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars.

A third and final reason that we do not need driverless cars is if we did, people would forget how to drive a regular car, or neglect to even learn. The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.",4,4,2,3,1,2,3,3,3
"I agree that changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be a better choice than to continue Electoral College. You may ask yourself why. Well, it's not fair to have to pick a random person to do something you should be the one doing. It's like saying you pick your neighbor to clean your house. Your house is still being cleaned, but not by you, instead, a random person you don't even know. Thus, continueing Electoral College is the same because in this case, the elector you pick and don't even know is going to make choices that at the end of the day you might not even agree on and you can't do nothing about it at that point.

During Elecoral College voters get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. This means, there is too many names on the list that you most likely have never even heard in your life, therefore leading you to voting for the wrong candidate. Some electors aren't even faithful, instead of going for their party's candidate, they rather decide voting for whomever they please. Most likely leading to alot of conflict because the candidate is not even on their party and the voters would hate to have to follow someone else's rules, yet again, can't do nothing about it.

Voters would always love to control whom their electors vote for, but this will never happen with Electoral College. The whole point to me for the Electoral College is so that the people voting for the electors won't have any power against anything. So that the government continues to have power over the people. That can be great at some point, but sooner or later will cause confict because some people don't always agree with what the government has to say or do. Therefore, changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S would be much better than to continue Electoral College.

On the article,

""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong

"". States that ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" Now right there is a perfect example of electors being ""unfair"". Electors want people to keep voting for them so that they can pick the candidates, yet, they always skip the part of showing who the candidates are. There is no why people will randomly guess how their candidates will end up being if they never even hear a few words from them.

In conclusion, I strongly believe changing to election by popular vote for president of U.S is a wiser decision than to continue Electoral College because it'll be fair to the people who are voting. People will start to get together to try and get to know the candidate, and most likely agree more to the idea than anything else. Mean while, Electoral College is a very unfair system because they have no idea who the elector is going to pick as candidate, and if they pick someone who they don't even know at the end of the day they will be stuck with a total stranger.",3,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,1
"As technology continues to advance, cars are seeing advancements in safety and driving capabilities that go further than what the driver can do. Cars the can sense when the car needs to break if the driver is distracted. Brakes that are anti-lock which means they distribute different amounts of braking pressure to wheels that may have more traction to prevent loss of control. All of these things are very good for cars and keeping drivers safe but are we close to seeing the ""Driverless Car""?

Cars have features now that can help or completely park themselves with the use of sensors. Many helpful gadgets that may help if human error occurs and can even prevent collisions. But then you have to also consider if this technology were to fail or have glitches that could be very dangerous. We can not know how these ""smart cars"" will age and how we can update the technology in them.

It is definitely possible to create a self-driving car. Many different organizations have succesfully done it but on closed tracks. These tracks do not have the real world complications that can arise such as road work or accidents that cause the car to go on alternate paths because the original one is blocked. This is when the human must take over and redirect the car.

Although there is this talk of a car that can drive without a human, we have not seen a car that is reliable and safe enough to be trusted without the driver being ready to take over when needed. If the driver has to sit at ready all the time then how is it a driverless car? As a driver, I know what I am capable of and I feel best when I am driving and I am in control. It would take a whole lot of trust for me to just turn my car on autopilot and let it take over considering there are many things that can happen while you are driving down the road. Many questions come up, such as, Will the car react in time? Will the technology even know to react? Will the car safely and controllably avoid whatever obsticle is thrown it's way. All these things change if the driver is sitting back not driving because the car apparently can do it all by itself.

Eventually, in the future, it is very possible to see cars with an autopilot function or other self-driving techniques but we are a long way from cars driving without human help. Laws in all but four states make it illegal to use a car that drives itself because, ""lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers"" (Paragraph 9). So it is obvious that we have a ways to go from a legal standpoint until you will see cars driving themselves on these American roads. This set aside, the advancements in technology is doing wonderful things in the safety category. Cars can avoid collisions or alert drivers if they make mistakes like going over the center double yellow lines. This helps prevent the awful head on collision of two cars. In conclusion, we are not terribly far from cars driving themselves. It is more a safety and trust concern rather than the technology being there. Cars will drive themselves more and more but with the aid of the driver always being there and capable of taking over at any time. But does this make them self-driving if the driver must be present and paying attention at all times? Why not keep their attention by just letting the driver, you know, DRIVE?",2,2,1,2,1,2,2,2,2
"In this passage I personally think that he did an good job with this artical. He mad sure that he included everythings that he needed to put in the artical. he inculeded that venus is earth sister and talked about NASA going to check out other planets and he evens explain the planet to.

Venus is the sister ouf the plantet earth because its to closes to earth. What i mean to the closes is Venus could possible be another earth because it has the same features and it may well once have been the most earth - like plantet in our solar system, and in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance too.

Earth is closes to venus and mars but orbit the sun at different speeds means sometimes we are closer to mar and sometime venus.

The NASA has talked about idea like sending humans to study venus. They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too.

This passage describe venus he say that the atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanets venus. The temperature in venus could averagr over 800 degrees fahrenheit. he dec=scrive the atnospheric pressure as 90 times greater than what we experience on earth.

In this passage I learned alot that i did not know about. I personally think he did good in this passage because he made me learn and i enjoyed reading this passage . I learn about venus and learn about NASA and what they might going to do.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The technology of being able to find out a persons emotions is interesting but not valuable. The technology is not valuable because a human can already tell another humans emotions without having to use technology, the computer cant comfort the human if he is upset, plus this technology could lead to technology becoming smarter than humans which then they could take over the world.

Humans are wired to be able to tell the emotions of another person. Humans dont even have to see the actions of a person before they know the emotion they are expressing on thier face. The reason we already know how they feel is because we do the same faces so we can relate to the way they feel and or look. Our brain makes connections better than a computer can when it comes to emotions, since a computer does not have emotions.

A computer does not have emotions, and if it does it is programed, therfore they are fake. Even if a computer can tell the muscles used in the face it doesnt make the computer correct about the mood they are in. The author tells us that you can make your muscles in your face move.This means you may be able to fake emotions to the computer which would give inacurate results, or the results could just be inacurate all togeather

The technological advantage of computers being able to read emotions can be dangerous. Machines with ""personalities"" could use the emotion scanning technology to their advantage. They could do so by decieving us into doing bad things. Machines could also use the information given to copy our facial expressions. If they copy our facial expressions the robots could communicate on a wholenother level.

In conclusion the technology to read emotions through facial expressions would not be valuable to students. Since humans can already know the emotions another person is expressing, the computer detecting the emotion cant change it, and machines may be able to use it to thier advantage in the future the technology is not valuable to students in a classroom. This technology is not valuable to anyone at all and should be destroyed.",2,3,0,3,0,1,1,1,1
"As the years have gone by, technology has significantly improved. Computers, iPads, and phones are just a few examples. I have to admit, sometimes I really hate having technology around. People become so absorbed in their technology that they lose touch with real people. But what about driverless cars? I believe that we should not have driverless cars.

In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the narrator states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills..."" However, there lies an important problem in this statement. What if the person in the car is not paying attention? If people today talk on the phone and text while driving, the they most certainly will do the same when they are not driving. Sure the article says that, ""...the car watches the driver,"" but a person can just ignore alerts and attention grabbing attempts from the car. Another problem is drunk drivers. If they drive drunk now, they will be a drunk passenger in the future. As soon as a human needs to take control, then we are back to the same problem as drunk driving now. Or, the drunk passenger could ignore the alert to drive altogether. I understand that in the future, cars may not need any human assistance at all, but the transition will be slow and if both human driven and driverless cars are on the road, I argue that a human driven car is safer. Yes, a driverless car will follow the rules of the road, but humans often do not. There have already been reports of Google cars getting into crashes because they were following the laws. However, a human driver may be able to react quickly enough to another driver.

In conclusion, human driven cars are safer than driverless cars. The transition to everyone having a driverless car will be slow, and therfore driverless cars will have to drive with human driven cars. They may follow the rules, but humans are unpredictable. Also, more people stay alert while actually driving a car rather than being a passenger. The age of driverless cars is not something we should look forward to, but rather something we should be wary of.",3,4,3,3,3,2,3,3,3
"As in my opionion I feel as they shouldn't have these cars because they are diverless cars and can cause many accidients.Why invent something that may cause harm to our society? They should just have regular cars that are controlled by our own feet. That we are controlling. They are bascially having a robot car because the car can do pretty much everything like a robot. It computer controlled and that can be really bad. It can be really bad because what if it senses something is there and there really isn't? That can cause a horrible accident or even cause someones life.

All though some people may argue with my statement because they think it'll be easier for the car was to be

gernerated controlled than for them driving it themselves, but I believe that is dangerous. They think that all they can just get in the car and just sit there and let the car drive but really they should do it by theirselfs.

I rather drive a car thats not so new and not have probelms while driving on the street than to get a whole new car thats impensive and anything can happen while driving on the street around other people.

I have stated my opinion and have to support it. I rather be safe than be in a situation I don't wanna end up being in.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless Cars Are Coming!

Think of all the movies you seen about cars driving by themselves, well they're becoming real. I actually like the fact they're making driverless cars, just like at the beginning of the article, imagine a new future full of technology. By 2030 they'd probably have robots cooking home meals, and tubes passing through out the sky and connected to other tubes for transportation. People wouldn't have to use so much money spending on gas trying to fill their cars up.

Today's world we have better technology where these driverless cars are getting better. There are cars with the ability to start up without an key, just push a buttion. We have cars now that knows when a accident is about to occur, or when an padestrian is near. Imagine driving in your car, and you take your eyes off the road for just a second and a child is in the middle of the street. Driverless cars will break itself and prevent injury to you and the child. Even for emergency vehicles or construction work, it will alert you that it's near. Some cars have self parking, meaning you could get out your car and watch it park itself just by hitting a button. Without hitting other cars, reversing on it's on, and even controlling the headlights if it was to park into a place somewhere dark. It's amazing what our future is becoming!

I believe they have a car that could drive itself. Say you're going on a roadtrip, and the vacation spot takes 24 hours to get there. Your car would drive to that destination while you rest. If your driverless car sees a human, animal, or object in front it will stop it self, there's sensors all over the car to detect that. Some driverless cars have cameras, you would be able to see your blindspot if you were driving. If you wanted to back up into a spot put couldn't see, they will turn on the camera video and you could watch how close you get to an object. These cars even make loud noises or make your seat vibrate to alert you of being to close. If you have a text or call come in, instead of taking your eyes off the road to reach for your phone, they have voice command where you can say ""answer imcoming call"" or many other things. There have been over a million car accidents caused by the drivers or even the car itself, but with the driverless car your safety is garenteed. The driverless cars are much safer for the driver, passengers, and even the outsiders. This is why I'm not against the development of these cars.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The use of Facial Action Coding Systems is valuable. This technology would help teachers and students help understand how their classmates are feeling. The use of this technology would help with the way students learn and could help prevent serious issues with the students.

By using Facial Action Coding Systems it would help students become more engaged in class. In the article by Nick D'Alto he states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". By using this new technology it would provide an effective learning way for each individual student. The computer would be able to reconize how each student is feeling then would modify to what helps each indiviual get engaged and learn. This technology would help students get better grades and it would customize to exaclty what helps them get engaged.

This new technology would also help you reconize exactly how each person is feeling. Many people are stuggling through depression or even worse things and they are so afraid to open up. Some people just don't know how to open up to anyone and this technology would help express what each person is feeling. In this article it state, ""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conves happy, worried, etc"" (Nick D' Alto). Eventhough we might think we know how someone feels we never truly know what is going on. This technology could help bring in end to the depression that some students are going through alone.

This technology could also open up ways to reconize if people are lying. Nick D'Alto states, ""Faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"". Being able to reconize how politicians or celebrities are feeling would help open up many truths to the world. For example if a student was to be lying you would be able to tell which could help out a lot in the classroom. Students might find it easy to lie which ends up getting the innocent introuble. This technology would bring an end to that.

The new technology called Facial Action Coding System enables us to identify humans emotions. This new technology would bring many different benefits to the world like helping people with their emotions, being able to reconize if people are lying, and it would help students become more engaged in their learning. Facial Action Coding System is a wonderful idea that should be brought into this world to help us get answers and help those who are going through a lot alone.",4,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
"My name is Luke and I have just graduated from high school. I had two part-time jobs. I worked at a bank and a grocerey store. It was 1945, World War II had just ended in Europe. I just had my friend, Don Reist, ask if I wanted to go to Europe on a cattle boat and we would be known as that Seagoing Cowboys. He told me that 44 nations joined together to form the UNRRA. They hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. I couldn't say no, because I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime. Don and I went over to Europe and many other countries and noticed they were left in ruins. Both of us signed up. Don and I did what we could to help out over in Europe and the many other countries in poverty after the war.

Here are some reasons that I think you should join. You get to help lots of animals, mostly cattle. Don and I got our seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster. We ended up with a cargo of 335 horses plus we had enough hay and oats to feed them. Caring for the animals kept me busy. They had to be fed and watered two or three times a day. Bales of hay and bags of oats were pulled up from lower ships. Also all of the stalls had to cleaned. On my second trip I served as watchman. My job was to check on the animals every hour.

Sightseeing was a huge plus for me. We went to Europe and China. My favorite place we visited was seeing the Acropolis in Greece. We rode a gondola in Venice, Italy. Did you know they have a excavated castle in Crete?

The last thing we saw was the Panama Canal in China.

It wasn't all serious work, we also got to have fun. Don and I played games to pass time. We played baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and many others. I'm grateful for the opportunity and that I took it. It made me more aware of people of other countries and thier need, instead of focusing on my needs or other people focusing on their needs. This is why I think that you should take an oppurtunity like this if you have a chance.""",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3
"Facial Action Coding System, a new technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Personally, I think that sounds like a good, well-built, successful invention. There are a lot of technologies and experiments that haven't worked in the past, but I think this could actually get the researchers somewhere. Technology seems to be increasing everyday and I feel like the new Facial Action Coding System is a good step to make and push forward for the future. The process is starting with a 3-D computer to make a model of a face.

That includes all fourty-four major muscles in the model must move just like you see on a real, living human. Without the muscle movement features, people would not be able to tell how this creature persay, is actually feeling emotionally or physically. The fact that the professers, and scientist are putting that much thought and detail into this object, is mind boggling. The author then explains in paragraph six, that the Mona Lisa demonstration is actually intended to make the people looking at it, smile. It also shows how much the computers can do and make. While looking at this newly invented object, it should make you think about how it was all created and how it all came to be.

Personally, I feel like this new invention called Facial Action Coding System could make a good impact on the kids in the future. Most people nowadays love technology and know how it all works. I feel like it's a good invention and could impact not just humans, but also the world. More jobs, careers, and opportunities will take charge with this new object at hand. I think it could become something new, helpful, and entertaining.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Driveless cars would be something wonderful as most people

would say. Driveless would be a good thing to have but it could also cause a lot of problems. It might seem good now as you sit and think about it, but you also have to think about other things that come along with it. Driveless has a lot of things to it to think about. They also have many positive and negative aspects.

When it comes to driveless cars I'm against the development.

To me driveless may seem or sound nice but I think that they will cause many problems as time goes on. One thing is from reading the passage it says that the cars are driveless but you still have to pay attention because when the car isn't able to do a certain thing, it may need human help. This a major problem to me because people don't pay attention to the road now with cars that they have to drive, so this isn't going to make anything better than it was. Another that will happen is that this could lead to many and more deaths if people aren't serious and cautious about what they are doing. These two things are major t reason why there shouldn't be driveless cars, but there are definetly many more.

Driveless cars isn't the way to go if you want things to get better. I think we should keep it the way it is and have human contolled cars. From what movies and television show, driveless car are our future. I just hope some people sit down and think before it happens.",1,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1

The reason why I think it is valuable is because everyone can now know the true meanings of things. In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" I think it is quite amazing that you can now tell how someone is truly feeling. Everyone has their days and you can just tell by their face what is wrong with them but that is the obvious. With this new technlogy, you can go more in depth on how they are feeling by simple facial expressions that you sometimes don't notice. In pictures or pantings you see a person half smilling, but that doesn't mean that they are half happy half sad. It just simply means that you shouldn't always just go off by what you see. With this technology you can see what the true meaning of the person's smile is or what their intentions are. In the article, it states that ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face."" If you have seen the painting, you will notice that the portrait doesn not seem like Mona Lisa is happy nor is it trying to bring us happiness. That just shows how much this technology can do. It is just pretty interesting how a computer can know what you are feeling.

In conclusion, I do think the technology called the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It would really be a helping hand for anybody. It helps detect the true feelings or meanings of things. This can be really useful for those who need a little help identifying what the true emotions really are. It is also very discriptuve. This is why I think this technology is valuable.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear Mr./Mrs. Senator,

In light of previous research I've done on the Electoral College, I would like the opportunity to voice my opinion on how the voting system should work in this country. Based off of the information acquired and with the best interest of the country at heart, I believe that the system should be changed to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

First and foremost, when voters vote, they aren't really voting for their candidate, but a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president. Don't you think that this method is a little impersonal? As well as the matter of possibly having one's chosen candidate not win the presidency-even when they've won the popular vote- as a result of losing the electoral vote. According to 'The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the best argument against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. The system allows room for crisis; technically state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, who could always defy the will of the people. An example, would be in 1960, when segregationists almost succeeded in replacing electors of the Democratic party with new ones who opppesed John F. Kennedy; as well as the case of some faithless electors refusing to vote for their party's candidate and pick whomever they like.

Another valid reason as to why the system of voting must be changed to popular vote is due to the unfair winner-takes-all way the electoral college works. In most cases, candidates do not see all states as important, only those they think they have a shot in winning over. A way to look at this, according to 'In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out desspised method of choosing the President', is that a regional favorite, such as Mitt Romney in the South during the 2012 voting, has no incentive to campaign in states outside of the region because he gains no electoral votes. However, this is also a disadvantage, for he cannot expand his popularity to other regions of the country. If he does so with the new popular vote system, winning the presidency will be guaranteed. Neglecting voters that are potential supporters of one's campaign is, in my opinion, the worst way to go about winning.

In summation, the Electoral College should be replaced with a popular voting system. I assure you that even though this system might have worked in the past, but in the ever changing world of politics, some things have to be done away with, and the Electoral College is one of them; with holes in the way the system works and outcomes that could possibly do more harm than good leave the Electoral College with nothing more to offer the future of this country. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

A skeptical citizen",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"I feel like it would be a great idea to have Driverless Cars. Why? It'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives and also it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways. And marketing would sky rocket. Many people would love to travel places but they'll get lazy to drive, but if they have a car that can drive itself then it would make it better on the humans life aswell.

Many people also agree on how bad it is. Honestly it does have some flaws and miss happs. One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others.

At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk.",1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,1
"As I read ""The challenge of Exploring Venus "" I feel as the main idea is to get people to understand that it is kind aimpossible to get to Venus. It is bassically dangerous to visit because its so close to earth but at the same time so far from it. Earth,Venus & Mars are all close together on the solar system but in real life its impossible to visit all 3 like we could visit states in one day. The authore really wants us to understand how interesting that Venus is because it holds alot of carbon dioxide in bankets,its beyond hot but cold in Venus,and is the biggest planets on the solar system. In the passage, The NASA wants to send people to venus to check out the planet because no human has yet to visit Venus in the last 3 decades. "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life ."" That should just explain to you that Venus is very large soit will definitly take awhile to get there.Hopefully one day in the future the NASA will achieve and get somebody up there to other planets and can show us other non astronstunats what it is like.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars! what a big leap in technology!, My position on driverless cars is that i think that its a very good idea to be able to drive on our own stll, even though the car has acess to be able to drive on it's own. It would make people feel safe to be able to prevent an accident if there was a mounfunction.

How ever the way technology is improving is truly fasinating, but there will be people out there that would like to drive on their own and be able to take breaks often. But like I said in the previous paragraph they would feel more safe if they where able to control on their own as well as wanting to take breaks here and there.

""Within 10 years sensors have become more advanced to detect ands respond to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. the sensors can apply breakes on individual wheels and reduce power from an engine allowing far better response and control than a human drive ever could."" quoted Google Cofounder Sergey. There could be serious monfunctions, we cant predict that cant happen. So i think it would be safer if we had the ability to choose to drive or not.

But in a way this could really help us out in the future, say that a driver is not paying attention to the road and they are about to hit a deer.. a sensor could very well come in handy to keeping anyone in the car safe and it also can prevent damage to the car. In other wods this could go either way it could be good but also have some concerns.

So in conclusion i belive that if we keep working at the technology we could very well have a success at driverless cars, but untill then i think we should really think out the pros and cons of this situation before we advance to the next step. This could very well be and amazing break through but also could lead us in to some complications, so in other words i belive that we should have thwe choice to drive and be able to have this advantage to be able to have this as an easy safe thing.",3,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Imagine if you could realize your friends emotions all the time. Facial Action Coding Systems might be our new way to know how someone is feeling. New software is being developed to better comunicate emotions. What if we had this technology in schools? To better understand our peers and know if they are okay. This would be a tremendous advance in schools nowadays.

If we had this technology in school teachers could better understand their students. Teachers could find out how the student are feeling and adjust according to what the students are thinking. This machine would help classrooms everywhere because if a student is board of the lesson odds are they are not going to pay attention. A student is not always willing to talk to a teacher and tell them why they are not doing well or what they dont like about class. You cant always be perfect at guessing how someone is feeling by what you see because they could be hiding their emotions from you. People would think that the machine would not work right and it would be false information being read. The machine is constructed by callibrating it to recognize all 44 major muscles in the model to move exactly like humans move. The machine has six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. And along with the characteristics are movements of the facial muscles. Each one of the emotions are designed to be read of human facial movements to detect emotion. All the steps to constucting this machine are great and are taken off of human facial movement.

Facial Action Coding machines could help teachers and staff stop suicidal thought or actions from occuring. Teachers are at school to help students and just the regular teacher dosen't always catch a student having a horrible day or getting bullied constantly. This machine could help teachers find the kids that are having it rough and sit down with them and talk. This machine would take away the amount of suicidal thoughts and even suicide at high schools all across the country.

This machine would help in many different catigories. If teachers started using this machine and making kids feel better everyday it would make students want to come back to school and want to learn. This would increase grades and student to teacher bonds. The students would carry that home and that would help parents. Kids would do more choirs and help around the house more. They would stop being so hostile twords their parents. This machine could bring so much good to schools and communities all across the world.

Although this machine would be great to have in schools it could be taken as a privacy issue. Students might not feel comfortable if a teacher or elder has a machine that can read how they are feeling. This could be an issue for many parents as well. If a parent does not want this in the school their child goes to they are more than likely to take their child out of that school. This could provoke other parents as well to get the wrong idea about this machine. The parents could see this as a danger in a school because they would no nothing about the machine or the students could be frightened from this machine.

To conclude my essay I think this device would be a great thing to have in schools. It could prevent kids from being bullied, having suicidal thought or even being board in class. It would help teachers get the right idea of what to teach in class and get the idea of students that might be having a really hard time. All in all this machine would be a great tool to use in schools all across the world.",4,3,0,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The so called ""face"" on Mars is clearly just a natural landform.

If it was a face, then why would it be the only one we see.

If this was a face, would it have been the only living being on Mars.

If it were a face, it does clearly resemble that of a human, but no human has been to Mars.

You could say maybe humans began civilization on Mars but we had to leave for whatever reason and when we got to Earth we suddenly went into a stone age, and that face was from a human that died on Mars, but that would have to have been millions of years ago and the ""face"" would no doubt have been buried in the sand.

If you are not yet convinced that this is just and landform that coincidentally looks like a face yet, then here are some more arguments.

In paragraph 7, it talks about how they took a much better quality photo of the ""face"" and it appeared to be nothing more than a landform.

You could also argue that maybe the sand covered up the facial features, but why wouldn't it have done that a long time ago?

Wouldn't that mean that whatever kind of species it was died recently?

If so why don't we see millions or thousands or hundreds or even tens of this species?

Was it the only one ever to exist on the planet.

If it Mars were sustainable for this creature, then it would clearly be sustainable enough for more creatures to appear just like it.

Also NASA scientists are no doubt more qualified then any average citizen when it comes to topics about other planets, and even they appear to think that it is just a landform.

If it was a face, this would prove that there was life on Mars which could benefit NASA, so they ultimately would have no reason to keep it from us.

This ""face"" is just a landform but people seem to think that it proves that there was life on Mars.

While there may have been life on Mars, I don't think that this landform proves it.",2,4,1,3,1,2,2,3,3
"According to the author of the ""Challenges of Exploring Venus,"" he believes that it is a good idea to pursue more knowledge of the planet Venus. The author feels that getting to know our sister planet is important, and that there are ways to explore this planet safely and effectivly. The author gives great examples of ways too explore the planet safely and effectivly, also he gives reasons why it would be beneficial.

Pursuing and expanding our knowledge of venus is beneficial in many ways and can be safely done. Venus having an average of 800 degrees fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditons are so extreme the author explains that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans."" Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans."" The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.

In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and since it is now 2016 it was about 40 years ago that a face was found on the planet. Some people think it was made by aliens and other people are logical and say it is a natral land form. I think it is just a land form because you can duscern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, we havent found anything else, and it look like some of the landforms here on earth.

First of all, in paragraph 11 it says that as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image up to 3 times its size. This helps prove it wasnt made by aliens because they cal close in on the picture and they didnt find anything else around it like other sculptures or houses or anything. therefore, it was either really old or just a land form.

Also, we haven't found anything else on the planet. If aliens made that dont you think they would have made other things and if they did wouldnt they also be there. It is not likely the face is an artifact because there should be more and if it was made by aliens and they had more it is unlikely that they made them and only that one is still there.

It does look a lot like what the agyptians made so if there were aliens they would probably be capable of doing that but it also looks like some of the landforms we have here on earth. Garvin even says in paragraph 12 ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. hat's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated masa about the same height as the face on mars.""

In conclution, It is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face. We havent found anything else on the planet and the ppicture doesnt have anything in it like a home. Also it looks like some of the landforms here on earth, we have some natural things that look wierd so why cant mars? The face was not made by aliens.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,1
"We need to find other ways to limit car usage. We should stop relying on cars so much. In ""

We all have our perfrences, like maybe you just like to use a car because it gets you from point A to B faster but walking or riding a bike can help you become more fit and active. In ""

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal it states that "" ""when I had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter... as she walked verdant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering childerm drown out the occasional distant motor"". this quote explains how when she gave up her car she seemed much happier and she didn't have to hear the sound of cars, all she could hear is bicycle wheel's turning and just the laughter of children. In ""

The End of Car Culture""

it says "" They organize thier summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" this quote is explaining how teens don't use cars that much they think of other ways to get around then just using their own car. They are trying to be more active in their life life then just using cars for transportation. They walk or car-pool they think of smarter ways to get around.

Although, we may think that oh it is faster but do you know what you are doing to the enviroment due to using cars as much as we do? In ""

Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog

"" it tells the reader "" After days of near-record- pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" This quote is illustrating to us that people are driving so much that they had to ban cars and not permit anyone to drive due to , to much air poulltion. People need to start walking more then use cars a city should'nt be able to ban cars because that means people are using them to much and poullting the air with that. In ""

"In my personal opinion, I think that it would be very valuable because when your having trouble on a problem and you need help but your teacher is busy doing something or you are on your own, it can modify the work down for you. I get frustrated all of the time with my work and I don't alway have a teacher right there with me to ask how to do something or to help me every time i'm stuck on a problem. I think it would be great and super convient, especially for the kids who need a little extra help on their assignments. This essay also goes to show how technology is taking over the world, sooner or later there will be no going to school, it will all be over computers from home. I think that this could really help some kids out but what if you get a text message and you start smiling about that and it thinks you are doing great so it doesn't modify it for you?

"The author supports this claim since he talks about how its very hard to travel to Venus. The thick atmospere is 97% carbon dioxide. The average temperature is 800 degrees fahrenheit. The pressure is 90 times greater than Earths pressure. Their are many earth quakes and volcanoes on Venus.

Many astronomers are faccinated by Venus since they think a long time ago it was covered by an ocean and had life forms living their. NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus to study the planet and its condition. They would send a blimp like vehicle hovering over Venisian landscape It would be hovering over Venus for about 30 miles. The people that they send to Venus would not have any samples from the planet since they would not touch or be in the surface of Venus.

NASA knows this is a big risk but they are still willing to take it. They have simulated a kind of material that would be used in Venus and it lasted for abouut 3 weeks. The computers now are fast, powerful and flexible but they can stand the condition Venus has. Even though its dangerous to go to we should always take risks. We should explore more places but we still dont have thaat kind of technology.

Venus could be a habitable planet. The idea of sending a blimp like vehicle to Venus is smart but dangerous. The blimp would only last 3 week if it was sent to Venus. The blimp has to be floating about 30 miles away from the surface. The computers indie the blimp would have to be srtong and fast to survive. The planet does not have easy conditions but is suvivable for humans.

Venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. Venus is hotter than Mercury even though Mercury is closer to the sun. The reason Venus is hotter than Mercury is because of its gases Venus contains in its planet. Venus is hot enough to liquefy any metal.

Even though Venus is not habitable in its soil we could still live above its soil. We would have to get used to the lightning and massive earth quakes this planet has. Its nearly imposible to live in the soil of Venus.",3,1,2,1,0,1,0,1,0
"You might not like the sea but you would like it when you get to take care of the animals.

You can be an Seagoing Cowboy when you are either 17.

My point of veiw of him being an Seagoing Cowboy is a great experience for him. My friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat ,but I didn't want to say no. I knew if he didnt take this oppurtunity of a lifetime.

I will feel sad for missing out on the oppurtunity.

Seagoing Cowhboys started out when the UNRRA started because the UNRRA wanted them to take care of the horses,young cows, and mules that were to be shipped overseas. If they shipped the animals overseas to a place they would get of the boat and go have some fun by doing a lot of activites. When the Seagoing cowboys went to Venice, Italy they rode and gondola because the streets are filled with water. when they went to Crete he toured and excavated catsle and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.

second trip, I served as a night watchman. My job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night ,after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down the ladder and cracked his ribs.

But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for me. It opened up the world to me .So if you wanted to be an Seagoing Cowboy you could be one if you like to travel a lot.

"Using drivless cars in the future would not a good thing because, it is pointless to have a car that drives itself but still needs the assiant of the driver when the road gets compilcated, and it is a safety issue.

In paragraph seven it says, ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs."" With this being said the driverless cars are practicually usueless because there is no need for them to be driverless if the driver still needs to be alert and aware when to take over.

Paragraph eight reads, ""We have ti interpret the driving fun in a new way."" ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feautire, and safety is a big concern.""

"Well first off Dr. Paul Eckman created a sytem called FACS, which creates affects and changes on human facial expressions for better results. This allows a new form of technology to change emotions and more. This software can identify emotions just like that!.

In my opinion I think that there is no need for this system to identify facials expressions on students. Because first we are young so you know when we are angry, happy, or sad because we tend to show it. Like body language older people and even people my age know when there is something wrong with one another, because you can tell how they usally are from how they are at that moment. Don't get me wrong i like what Dr. Paul came up with this type of science and technology, but i dont think it's neccessary to change pictures and add emotions to something.

I just think using this technology on these students wouldn't do much, but tell you whether or not there sad, angry, happy, confused, excited, and etc. However this technology shounldn't go to waste I mean you can use this technology in other ways like animlas, you can't really tell whether an animal is happy, sad,and etc.

But so far I like the whole idea just not the type of experiment Dr. Paul is trying to accomplish.

"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile""

a computer softaware program called the Facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows computers to identify human emotions is said to be able to help the educational atmoshphere of the classroom. However the use of this software to read the emotional expressions of students is not all that valuable to the classroom.

The use of compters in most schoold is limited at best, and not all schools have access to computers at all, so the use of the FACS program would not impact many students or classrooms. The best way to use the program would simply as a way to sell products to the general public not as a way to make learning more inclusive. A comercial use would best suit this program, and allow it to reach more people for example in the text it states "" if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similair ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". The use of this program in electronic or online lessons would also be detremental towards the social skills that a classroom is meant to nurture. It would remove the human element that young minds need to grow.

Now one might say that the use of this program in schools would better the learning environment and make the lessons easier fro students to understand.

This is the stance the inventor of this technology believes when he said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""then it coud modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"". However this would be inneffective in classrooms and schools that do not have the resources that are needed for this application. There are also very few schools that actively use electronics inside of the classroom while they have the needed resources.

This technology has other ways that it could be used, that would be of more use in todays society besides in the classroom. There is very little need for such a thing to be used in a learning environment. The use of this program would have almost no use in the development of young minds, and would prove inneffective in the classroom setting.",2,3,2,3,1,2,1,2,1

Have you ever thought of the face coming from nobody realizing it when they walk they may kick the dust and it could have formed and it may not be that windy, so it nevers moves. The face could represent that there could be life on Mars.

There are many thoughts as to how the face happened. Also ""few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact."" Not every scientist has to believe the same thing as another scientist. The face is most likely naturally there because there are many things in the universe that are naturally made. Many mountains, hills, cracks, and special marks on things are usually natural, which is why many people believe the Face on Mars is naturally there.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Its just a natural landform because it says in the article that, the landform reminds them about, most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Also scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like Egyptian Pharaoh. Then a few days day later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. And for 25 years some people think the face

is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Although few scientists believed the Face was an ailen artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Sept . 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. They felt this was important to taxpayers, explained Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it.",1,2,3,1,0,1,0,0,0
"In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"". The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it might present. Venus is the second planet from our sun, which makes it easier to see from Earth compared to all the other planets. In this article the author uses the dangers and the old projects to prove that Venus is a worthy pursuit.

The author uses the dangers of studying Venus by using past experiences of traveling to Venus to prove that yes it has its risks, but it is worth it at the end. The author uses past experiences by stating in paragraph two ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for hunams to study, despite its proximity to us."" This quote helps prove that landing on Venus has been a big challenge, but scientist are willing to overcome these challenges despite the dangers. The authour also states in paragraph six that "" Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement also helps prove the point that exploring Venus more is worth taking the risk because researchers are working on innovations to help the trips be more efficent. Which helps the author support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author also uses old projects to help support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author claims in paragraph seven ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. The devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This passage suggest that by the use of mechanical parts can be made more resistant or could be adjusted to pressure, heat, and other things. By tweaking this the author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursit.

In the article the author uses the dangers and old projects to prove that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Also by studying Veuns there could be alot more things discoverd by that panet. Yes, it consits of many dangers but their are mutiple things that have been learned from the past experiences that could possibly help us aviod that in the future. The author idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite some of its dangers.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Many people think that the face on Mars was created by aliens, however that is not true. The face on mars is just a natural landform and it has nothing to do with aliens.

When the sciencetists saw the first picture taken of it they figured it was just another martian mese, that was common around Cydonia. The image was captioned ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head..."" It was just a landform and had nothing to do with aliens. Just because it looked like a human head doesnt mean anything. Very few scientists even belived the face was created by aliens. Which means that most of them knew it was just a natural landform.

When the second picture was taken, all they saw was just a natural landfrom with no alien monument at all. They then took a third picture of it because most people were not satisfied with the second one. The thrid picture just shows the Martain equivalent of a butte or mesa. It looks like landforms here around earth. If their are similar things on Earth that are just landforms then the face on Mars is just a landform too.

The face on Mars was not made by aliens it was just a landform. It just happened to look like a human face in the first picture that was taken. But with the better pictures, It wasnt a face after all. It was just a mesa.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"Places around the world such as Germany, America, Paris, and Columbia are all contributing to reduce the use of cars to help make the Earth a better place. In German they dont allow cars exept to be parked in a large garage (along with a $40,000 fine) so people can transport without using a car. Paris bans the use of cars to prevent smog which was indeed a problem there. In Bogota, Columbia, they pitch in to help by hosting a car-free day every year, once a year leaving people the options to hike, bike, skate, or take a bus promoting the use of excersize. Advantages to limiting car usage is reducing people from having stress and tensadity and saving the Earth from pollution and smog. Saving people from stress can be helped by the vancansy on the roads, things that limited car usage can provide. Limited car usage can also help contribute to the absence of air pollution and smog and saving your money.

""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" retorted Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two. She, Heidrun Walter, along with others is thankful for the ban of cars because the ban reduces stress and tensity. Buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaza can second this statement and does by stating ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". With the absence of traffic jams stress can most definitely be altered to a place of no stress and car-free day can leave the streets devoided of traffic jams, according to Andrew Selsky. Stress can drive someone crazy and it's in everyone's best interest that we, as residants of the world, try and stop the things that can cause stress. Some may argue that not having a car is stressful, but having stress over the presence of traffic jams can over see any other kind of stress to be thought of. Heidren Walker and Andrew Selsky can both support that argument that having a car is a lead to stress that a reduction of cars can elimanate. Tensity and stress aren't the only upsides to a limitation on cars.

Are you tired of not being able to see bevause of smog and having bad particles in the air? Limitation can take away these issues! Paris can definitly be one to complain because in Robert Duffer's article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" they had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter (a little over Brussels counts and almost twice as the amount in Londons). Bogota is also struggling with the presence of smog and are in hopes to anialate the smog by having a car-free day. Car-free day also helps make the air pollution vanquish. Carlos Arturo Plaza gives his opinion by commenting ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Limitating how much you use your car can greatly help places around the world and help your own body.

Almost 4,000 drivers were fined because they chose to invalidate the regulation of not using their car according to Robert Duffer. Is it worth paying the prices? Using your cars overly or when you shouldn't is like throwing away food when you're hungry. It does no good and gets you in a messed up situation. In German suburbs people had to pay a price of $40,000 to pay for a spot to park their car. Is it worth it? People who drove on car-free day had to pay fines of $25. Is it worth it? So much money is down right wasted because of the use of cars so why go down the road of empty pockets? It's not worth it. Save money and live better by not throwing your money down the drain.

Places around our world is promoting limiting car use in places like Germany, America, Paris, and Columbia. Germany and Paris are both bannings cars and Columbia is having a car-free day. Making sure we dont over use our cars can help with saving ourselves from stress, saving ourselves from smog and air pollutants, and saving ourselves from an empty wallet. There are so many advantges to limiting our use on how much we drive cars so do yourself a favor, save money, save your sight, get rid of stress and watch those miles!",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I believe that the integration of driverless cars into the current-day road system would only pose a threat to the majority of drivers. Incorporating a new form of transportation into a pre-existing form would only complicate the roads more than before. Cars have been around for roughly 100 years and society has adapted to this certain form of transportation that is used world-wide. Although driverless cars seems very advanced and the engineering involved in their production is beyond my imagination, driverless cars will have a negative effect on the current-day road system.

Being a teenager, I am approaching a new level of responsibility and encountering a world very foreign to me, driving. Having the ability to drive brings a whole new world of responsibility to teens all over the United States. Although there are many teen fatalities due to driving, I believe that driverless cars will not thoroughly incorporate the new level of responsibility that teens have as they approach legal driving age.

Another aspect of my argument pertains to the current driving and road laws. The reading states that a majority of the driving laws are focused on keeping drivers and their passengers aware that safety is achieved through alertness. Traffic laws are formed based on the idea that human drivers are in control at all times. Integrated driverless cars will interfere with the traffic and road laws that are in place today. If driverless cars became the popular form of transportation, would new traffic laws be incorporated to adjust to the new form transportation? Or since driverless cars are operated by computers, would there be the need for traffic laws at all?

Although driverless cars could bring a very efficient form of transportation, they seem to add too much technology to a long-lasting form of transportation. Driverless cars will take away the aspect of great responsibility from teens and new drivers as a whole. And driverless cars will only complicate rules, laws, and regulations of our road system that have been in place for decades. Ultimately, how much are we as a human race willing to give up to technology?",3,3,1,3,3,3,3,3,3
"Dear Senator, I wish to ask you a favor of keeping the Electoral College or changeing to election by popular vote for the presdent of the United States. First of all, the reason that I want to ask you this is because Most states have a winner take all system that they give to the winning president.

Next, after presidential election, the governor prepares a Certificate of Ascetainnent. listing all of the presidents who ran for president. after the presidental election is heild every four years on a tusedayafter the first monday in vovember. you help chose your states electors.

Furthormore, People should vote for a state of several Democratic electors pledged . On the off chance that those electors won the statewide election. oh yea and senitor under the eletoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president .

Finally, Fromm my opinion the presidental party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the partys nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed. However, it is entirerly possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not winthe nactional popular vote.

So Mr. senator sir im only asking you this one thing if u coud just keep the Electoral college or changing to election vote for the president of the United States. pleez thats all im asking from you to  do for me just one thing. quite sime thing to do right ..",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Facial Action Coding System, is a system that can read expressions of humans. Whether they're lying, sad, mad, or happy. I think it would help with crime and school.

The uses of the Facial Action Coding System would be helpful because it'll make things so much easier with crime and school. In crime the police would be able to use this technology against the accomplice and the thief. It'll be helpful because it would be able to tell whether the thief's lying or not. this could be helpful in many different areas as well such as schools and jobs even sports.

School would be nice to have a Facial Action Coding System because it would help with cheaters and thieves. Schools have many cheaters during tests. They're sneaky and really annoying. It'll just make things easier in school because students wouldnt want to cheat anymore because they'll know that they might get caught. Other reasons why is if a student is lying to the teacher about understanding the lesson or the chapter because they're embarressed of it. The teacher could just use this piece of technology to see whether the student is actually understanding the lesson or chapter.

But american's love for car's have been cooling . so far , so good automobiles have been an important travel for us now and back then for the people. Dufferent things are converging, which that we suggest are witnessing a long term -term cultural shift.

"A Seagoing Cowboy is a cowboy who travels overseas to a different country and take animals/supplies there that they are in need of. This job takes a lot of work. You have to watch all the animals every hour, clean their stalls, and feed them. This job does take a lot of work, but it is a unique experience one will never forget. You get to Help other countries in need after the war, see amazing countries and sights , and have fun with new friends you get to meet while traveling. It is a great experience.

After World War ll, several countries were left in destruction. This meant that someone needed to help fast, and get the people food, animals, and other supplies that were needed. 44 nations came together as UNRRA, also known as the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"", like myself. We help deliver horses, young cows, and mules to the countries in need. It feels so great to help other people, and I will never forget all the smiling faces I saw when I arrived with their animals. It is a wonderful sight.

When you visit several countries, you never realize how wonderful and amazing they can look, even after a war! Places like Europe, China, Greece, Italy, and the list countinues. After we deliver the animals, we get to have a little bit a of fun before we go back, so we get to go to tourist attractions, and popular cities in the country. I was able to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, where the streets are made up of water. I also got to see the Acropolis in Greece. Those trips were pretty special! There are so many great things to see and do in every country, so no matter where you go, you will have a great adventure exploring the cities, and having a ton of fun!

While being on a boat, traveling to a country, you have to watch over the animals every so often. That is not the case on your way back, when the animals are gone from your boat at the country you just visited. Since the animals are gone, you can do whatever you want to do to make the time pass. We do things such as table-tennis, volleyball, boxing, fencing, baseball, reading, and more fun games. You really can't play things games without people to play with, which is a great way to make friends. Since you probably don't know the people working with you, you can get to know them, and make new friends. This is one of my favorite parts of being a Seagoing Cowboy, because without becoming friends with your co-workers, you job isn't fun. It's a great way to open up, and whats more fun then going over-seas with your friends and having a good time?

In conclusion, becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is an amazing experience because you get to help others in need after the war, see amazing places/sights, and have tons of fun while making new friends with the people you work with. You will have so many great memories of your time at every country. Become a Seagoing Cowboy today!",4,4,3,4,2,2,2,2,3
"Although Venus is a very dangerous planet, the author in this article ""In The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", makes it well known that scientists are still up for the challenge of exploring this intimidating planet. For over 30 years now, scientists have been researching, studying, and observing the planet and all of it's functions, in order to find a way to safely study it. Because of it's extreme weather conditons, it has been almost impossible to do that. Attempts have been made, sedning unmanned spaceships to Venus aound 30 years ago, but not one of them lasted more than a few hours, according to the article.

The author says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth, in terms of density and size."" He makes a point here by telling us that Venus is pretty similar to Earth. He goes on to describe it's landforms as, ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" As he descirbes it, it sounds a lot like Earth. The auhtor believes that it is a worthy pursuit studying Venus, despite it's dangers, because, ""not only because of the human insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here, he is explaining that us humans have a curiosity to explore, but also, we have a desire to learn more about the features of this mysterious planet, and see if it is one day habitable, in some form.

Farther along in the article, the author provides us with details about new research and trials that NASA is performing for Venus exploration. He tells us about a new kind od electronic device that can withstand three weeks of Venus's conditions. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions."" Proceding that, he explains to us how a new mechanical computer, made of levers and gears, has been constructed and is expected to be able to be more resistant to Venus's conditions.

Throughout this article, the author gives us readers many great details and insights on the exploration of Venus. A great point he makes towards the end is, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" By saying this, he gets his point across that it is a very worthy pursuit to continue exploring Venus. We will gather new information as humans, and gather new information about Venus.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Have you ever thought something was another thing when it wasn't? Have you ever had to let people down by telling them what it actually was? Surprisingly, NASA has done this before. NASA had sent one of its spacecrafts, the Viking 2, to search for their first protogy named the Viking 1. While it was in search for it the Viking 2 discovered what appeared to be a human face.

NASA unveiled the picture of ""the human face"" for everyone to see. They thought it would be a good way to attract attention to Mars. And, sure enough it was! Everyone loved the idea of the ""Face on Mars"" so much that people started to write books about it, base movies on it, and people on talk shows would even make conversation on it! The only negative side was scientists didn't really believe the Face was actually alien artifact. And it was soon proved that it was only shadows that made it appear the shape of a human face. Scientist described the Face as just a mesa or a butte, and really it is nothing more uncommon than a natural landform. Even in the article they described the whole theory as just ""somthing funny"".

People weren't very satisfied when NASA had to break the news that the ""Face on Mars"" was nothing more than science fiction. In conclusion it wasn't really anything interesting at all unless you find landforms all that and a bag of chips. The ""Face on Mars"" is now just a silly theory we made in the past and nothing more. There's no argument on weather it's real or not because most scientist to begin with were skeptical on the theory of it being an alien artifact. I hope this helped you understand what the ""Face on Mars"" really is.",2,2,2,3,1,1,2,1,2
"I can see that you migth of think that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."". Might be created by aliens but it's not. I have information that this natural landform is not ceated by aliens. ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."". This is saying that the natural landform is formed by shadows.

And another thing is that they went again to see if they could take a picutre again of the natural landform but, they had a better camera they would allow them to see better if it was true that the natural landform was true. "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 metters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo."". That is saying that they got a better camrer, its can see more thing that the other camera could not see.

This is another example that the camera can see that the other camera could not see. "" So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". that us saying that it can focus from farther distance.

The last thing I will tell you is what they found out about the picture they took with the better camera and to see if it was ture or not. That the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."".

Was created by aliens or the shadow was making it look like a face. "" What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte mesa.""

In conclusion all of this ""drama"" was for nothig becuas it was not created by aliens it was just mother nature that did all of this. All it was the shadow that maked it looked like it had a face.",2,3,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To the senator of our state,

The electoral college makes a big impact on our voting system. However, it needs to be changed or even abolished. The manner in which the eletoral college funtions is not fair to the public. By the time you've finished this letter I hope you'll have taken my suggestion to mind.

For one the electoral college makes voting feel unvalidated. It should be the public themselves that choose the president, not a signifigantly smaller group of people. This was the case in the 2000 election, when Al Gore was not elected even though he had a popular vote of 60 percent. This gives many people the mindset that if their votes will be overuled by the electoral college, then that gives them less of a motivation to vote.

This brings us to my next point. If the electoral college is abolished, than more people will want to vote. Now, the public's opinion is just as important as the college's in our current system, but there would most deffinately be a increase in the number of votes if this system was deystroyed. What drives people to vote in the first place is that they want their opinion to be heard, so the electoral college is preventing their opinions from being heard.

Another reason to abolish the electoral college is that I don't think that many people know it exists in the first place or at the very least know how it works. If more people were given the explanation from these articles, they would probably feel the same way; that their votes no longer mean anything by the time election day comes.

To conclude, the electoral college is an outdated concept in our federal system. It should be abolished so that the public will have a greater sense of purpose when they vote. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read my suggestion.",2,4,1,3,1,2,2,1,2
"What a time to be alive, we have many new inventions that have changed our lifes for the good and for the fun of it. There is one new technological advancement that could change our lives entirely, the self driving car. The self driving car is a car that well does what it sounds like, it drives its self. Although there are many positive aspects for this new invention im here to talk about the bad. This new technological advancement should not be develped because, the driver would still have to be alert, if the technology fails who is to blame, and it is just to pricey.

It would suck if you were in a car that can drive itself but you still had to be there alert. The self driving cars requires you to be there constantly holding the wheel. If you are at the wheel aready why shouldnt you just drive the car yourself? Plus the car can only move no faster than 25mph. We tend to go faster than that so you might as well do it yourself. Also it would be like your waiting for your turn to drive. You would only be getting the car to drive in risky or dangerous situations. Lastly it would get boring waiting there in your car with your hands on the wheel.

Say you got into a crash, who is it to blame? You take your eyes off the road for a split secong and bang, your self driving car just crashed into another car. Is the fault yours or was it the cars? See if we make these cars we would have to make new laws on whos to blame. Also it wouldnt be safe for pedestrians and you. If the systems fail you could go crashing into something or someone without a warning. The best way to ensure someones safety is with a human driver behind the wheel.

Most people wouldnt even be able to afford a self driving car in the first place. If and when these cars come out, the average american wouldnt be able to afford it. With all that technology on and in the car it would most likely double the price of cars if not increase it drasticly. Also it will cost a lot of money to send up satillites in space to map our cities and countries. The money to send these up comes form us.

These are some of the reasons why we shouldnt make self driving cars, you would still have to be there sitting at the wheel alert in case something happens, who's fault would it be if you crashed, yours or the cars? Lastly the price to make, sell, and send up satillites in space would be to much. Also the best way to ensure someones safety is with a human driver behind the wheel not a computers.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
"This paragraph is talking about the venus and describing what's Venus mean.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is the closest planet to the earth, about 97% carbon diocide is blankets venus. now Venus still has features that are analogous to those on the Earth.

"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has made their article over the progress of studies done on Venus, the ""Evening Star"" of our skies. They collected research and human planetary exploration of our solar system, and I'll be going over claims and their ideas of just how passionately they support their ideas of studying Venus despite dangers.

My evaluation of the successful writings the author had written is crucially on how they told about the difficulty of the mission would be on Venus, seeing as they inform us the tempatures on the planet average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, with atmospheric pressures there being a startling 90 times greater amount than our planet, and with all this there is little knowledge about what makes up the ground, water or gas of the planet. And with all the probes we've sent last only a few hours each within each landing. On our way to finding a way to overcome these challenges we found discoveries made on the way about future planet explorations that could someday be made by humans on Venus itself.

The author wrote that current discoveries made by scientists show that Venus also had a past of preserving life on its planet, and even having geological landscape features similiar to Earth. The planet's orbit provide nearby space travel making it a possible and easy route for planetary visits, which is crucial seeing how long space travel can take with our current modifications and technology. The article's author then backs this up on NASA's critical ideas and discoveries for sending humans to Venus for studies.

A solution the researchers have proposed for tells of a floating or a blimp transportation vehicle capable of carrying people over the potential dangerous landscape and acidic clouds for closer examination of the planet around 30 miles up in the air. Despite the distance, they would still be in 170 degrees Fahrenheit weather, with pressures close to sea-levels like on Earth, but solar power generation would be easy to obtain, and radiation levels are equal to the safe places of Earth's. Meaning for a difficult, but survivable enviroment for us humans to be in.

As invigorating as that may seem, They then tell on how undeveloped the idea still is, seeing as hovering over 30 miles would definitely avoid dangerous conditions, but also samples and direct contact with critical minerals and materials that could be discovered from below would make studies on the planet not as plentiful as it could be. Leaving options for a need to find ways for a closer, but riskier challenges to get the samples and materials they would need to make far by more accurate studies with the planet Venus.

They go on to tell us about machines capable of withstanding the tempatures capable of melting tin, which would be dire against tablets and cell phones we have on Earth, and how machines we've had designed in 1800's could survive with some modifications, or silicon carbide simplified electronics have been made to withstand the heat and acidic conditions.

I conclude my essay with the standpoint that the author successfully drew in readers, and did an incredible job of telling us the usefulness of missions to Venus would be if we could potentially land humans to explore the planet, and where the studies could take us as an intelligent species.",3,2,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"The article, Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author tells about a new technology called the F.A.C.S. It stands for Facial Action Coding System. The system enables computers to identify human emotions. I think that the use of this technology, to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Yes, there are some aspects of the technology that cause some concerns to people, sure.

Though it may be difficult to except this new technology for some, but in my opinion I would have to say that I think this is a valuable form of technology. They gave the example of how they used the famous known painting by Leonardo da Vinci,

Mona Lisa. This painting includes the portrait of Mona Lisa. She is smiling in the slightest with her hair down and her emotions appear to be happy. The Facial Action Coding System (F.A.C.S.) used the painting to see if it could recognize her emotions. The results appeared to be ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry"". Of course we cannot really know if that was her real feeling at the time but the system concluded that was what she was feeling at the time.

They make the point that we can tell if a friend of ours is happy, sad, angry, fearful, etc.. Though we can not tell for sure, and we definitely would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys all the possible emotions we have. The computer system would make it so we would be able to identify what emotions we were having if needed. The new computer software would store similar anatomical information as electronic code. The F.A.C.S. enables the computers to identify our emotions to an extent that we can not. The system would be helpful in many different situations.

If we had computers that could do such things as they said in office buildings, hospitals, etc..

it would help out a ton. In office buildings they could be used by many people to determine if you're happy with your job or what you're doing at the time being. In hospitals it would be helpful to determine how the patient is feeling. You could put one computer in every room to help and see if a persons facial expressions could tell how they feel at the moment. It would benefit the nurses or the doctors so they would know how often to check up on the patient.

The most helpful place they could be would be in schools. Many teachers give out assingments on the computer most of the time now. If we had the F.A.C.S. in our schools it would help to tell the teachers if we are learning. Our facial expressions give off a lot more information then we would think. As the author said in the article in paragraph six, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" If we had the Facial Action Coding System, it could help the teachers by reporting to them if we seem like we either have the information learned or if we were having difficulties with the homework.

Our face tells a lot, according the the article and Dr. Huang. With the F.A.C.S most of them can all be told. It is a valuable system that most schools should have to determine the emotional expressions each student has. It could raise grades if the teachers would know if we were struggling just by the facial expression we make while doing our homework, test and projects. It is a very advanced system that could cause some problems for sure but the benefits would be outstanding.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his claim by stating that the reasoning for continuing research on how to get to Venus's surface is, because it was once very similar to earth's surface long ago.

Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim. So far the author's claims are, that it is our nearest option and it was once very much like Earth and habitable.

The only problem now is Venus's surface conditons. On Venus's surface the temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. However the author goes on to state that NASA has a possible solution to the conditions on Venus's surface. NASA's possible soolution would be to have a blimp like vehicle hover 30 miles above Venus's surface. Even though the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit it is still survivable for humans. However researchers cannot take samples of Venus's surface by hovering in a ship safely above the planet. The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges.

The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2

"Driverless cars have always been a point of interest as our technology advances. I am for driverless cars because they could make the roads safer.

These driverless cars are not completely driven by a computer. There are certain times where the person in the car has to take over, like work zones or accidents. However, for the most part, these cars have so many sensors and cameras in them that they can drive without the help of a human driver. This could mean that accidents that happen when the driver is distracted or incapacitated, would never happen. Once our technology advances ever furthur and these cars actualy become driverless, then they could prevent accidents.

Cars made by companies like Google or Tesla are not only interested in make a cars driverless, but they want to make a car that would be better for the environment. Google cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a car that ""would use half of the fuel"", and Tesla's focus has been on electric cars. Both of these options reduce or elimate the need for fossil fuels, therefore reducing carbon emmissions and taking better care of our environment.

Although there is some serious work to be done to be able to test these cars to improve the cars to be legally considered safe, I think that the reality of driverless cars is not to far away, and that it is a good thing. They could make the road a safer place and help out our environment.",2,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,3

Im going to tell you 3 reasons why you should join. Hope you like it.

The first reason that I came up with is that if you join you get to see alot in only one trip. What I mean is that if you join you get to sea the ocean, sea and all those wonderful animals that live in the ocean. And if you like animals thats way better. The second reason that I came up with is that if you join you get to visit diffrent places. Like how Luke did he got toured on an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal.

"The author supports the claim very well. The author says many ways how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. For example, paragraph 5 states ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. imagine a blimp-like veichle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet planes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a veichle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

It also states in paragraph 5, ""But the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

It finally states in paragraph 8, ""Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""",1,3,4,3,2,3,2,2,3
"The author makes a good reason why people should study venus is by talking about the certain type of things there is at venus. Also by explaining how it could help others to have a good idea traits, it's also good because of how the author says challenge so others can see it like if it was impossible and try it for themselves. It'll be hard but it won't be impossible for venus to explored even more. Also could be the next thing that we could do experiments on and find out ways to use the planet.

The author makes a good idea that venus is worthy to study because he talks about the comparisons of earth and venus which makes it curious for people to find out what are the comparisons and also could find out the differences too. according to the text it says "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogoues to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This explains that there is things from earth that are relatable to venus, and people could research how they're familiar and how they're different from earth. It's important to know because you'll see what venus has and you'll just learn more from what it is from earth.

Another way the author makes a good idea that venus is worthy to study is because it helps others to have a good idea about venus and traits about itand the challenges. The author makes a good point about how if we did go to search vernus it'll be difficult but it'll be worthy for you to know. An example the author states is "" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. "" this means that if you were to examine venus, you'll be at a challenge with climate while doing research and exploring. Another example is "" Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that it'll be difficult to be able to go out and to see what's the matetrial and objects in venus is like.

The Author helps the people that want to see how venus is and could help them and do research on it so it could be a good exploration to do since it really hasn't been seerched on and why not do it now? Some people could be curious and might want to know how it is in planets other than earth and learn something new from it. That's why venus should be explored by people that give informationa bout space and planets.",3,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear Senator,

I wrote this letter to tell you we should keep the electoral college process. I know you must get hundredths of letters everyday about this,but it is a very important topic to discuss. We did it this way every since the founding fathers created it. Most people wouldnt understand that,but this is a process on witch are nation grow up on learning. Its kind of amazing that we still remeber this way,and still continue to use it. This is just one of the reasons that have yet to come.

Also,wouldnt it be diffucult to just change the system out of thin air,think about it. You also have to think about the people who disagree with changing the system. People can stop voting if they dont like the system. If nobody votes,then are country cant move fourth into the future,and if that happens the USA mint have a civil war. From a diffrent stand point it mint not be a bad thing to get a new system. This is just another reason why we shouldnt change the system of voting.

The system we have now works,so what will be the point of changing something if it is not broken. The system we have now makes sure not one man has more power than the next man or woman. Think about the improving we have done to the current system,before blacks even couldnt vote into they improved the system. Back then their were alot of errors and stuff wrong with the process into they started improving. Now,why would you want to throw all that hard work away. This is just another why another why we shouldnt get rid of the current voting system.

We even made amedements to help enchance the system,without these amedments the power will be uneven. For instance if they didnt make a amedement to stop slavery then,blacks wouldnt even be able to vote. How bout they didnt make a amendment to give girls the right to vote then the power will still be shifted. You also cant forget how many people fought to make the power equal. If the power is shifted in the tighest a civil war can break out,and ruin what we worked so hard to protect. This was the last reason why we shouldnt chang the system.

All in all my letter was about how we shouldnt change the current system we have now. If we do all that hard work will go to waste. We spent so many years perfecting the system. Many people have fought to keep power in check bewteen people. If we made a new system it mint be worse then the system we have. That is why we shouldnt change the system.

"Do you think exploring other planet is worth it even when it's very dangerous? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. To support this idea, the author gave a few reasons. The first support is that Venus is the planet that is most like Earth. The second support is that striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has values. The third support it might be possible to make the mission both safe and scientifically productive.

First, Venus is the planet that is most like Earth. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Even today, Venus still has some feature that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus is sometime even referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Venus also have some familiar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

Next, striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has values. The travels to Venus can be use to expand and meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. That is not the only reason why the challenge of exploring has value, the other value is that the reacher that what NASA is doing can lead to new inventions that can help humanity. Another value of exploring Venus is the insight to be gained on the planet itself.

Finally, the last reason the author gave to support the idea that the challenge of exploring Venus is worthy to pursuit is that it might be possible to make the mission both safe and scientifically productive. If it is possible to visit and study Venus, then why not do it? If people can actually visit Venus, then maybe they will find something that can help humans. They might even find prove that aliens are real. Maybe being able to explore Venus can show how far humanity has come.

In conclusion, In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. To support this idea, the author gave a few reasons. The first support is that Venus is the planet that is most like Earth. The second support is that striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.

"Even though driverless cars can solve many problems, they can also create many problems. Driverless cars can enhance the risk of accidents on the road and put other drivers on the road at risk for danger. They also rise the question of liability. Who is responable if there is an acciedent involving a driverless car? The creation of this car can also promote laziness.

Driverless cars can enhance the risk of accidents on the road and put other drivers on the road at risk for danger. Roads are already dangerous with human error that can lead to accidents, and sometimes death. By putting a car on the road that can drive by itself rise the danger rate. How can you insure safety for other drivers on the road? It reads in the text ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves"" cars are machines and machines have malfunctions, so how can you trust a machine to have control of your life?

However, driverless cars also rise the question of liability. Who is responable there is an accident involving a driverless car? Who should we blame the car or the driver? ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrains safe"" if this is true driverless cars have no liability. Driverless cars open a window to endless amounts of questions, all of which needs to be answered before they are on the road.

Lastly, driverless cars also can promote laziness. Technology is a beautiful thing to have but it can also make us lazy. Technology such as cellular phones have become a dependent for many people. So adding driverless cars to the list of technology that make us move and be active is dangerous. Car driven by people allow them to interact with their surroundings, but driverless cars take away a lot of that interaction.

In conclusion, I do not support driverless cars because of many different reasons. One it has a safety risk for other drivers, two who is responable for a accident involving a driverless car, and finally it promotes human laziness. Until all of the logical concerns have been answered these cars should not be on the road. Driverless cars might be in the wave of the future but not until we are sure their are little to no health concerns.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Something big is beginning. Cars are starting to be a questionable need. Of course we need them in some situations. But the sales of cars are declining. People are becoming more united as one. The way it should be. If we worked together, we could accomplish many things. But besides that, cars give off emission that gets trapped in our atmosphere. We need to conserve the ozone layer. Without it, skin cancer is sure to hit hard with the UV rays beating down on us. I believe that cars are becoming outdated. We still need them, but do we really need so many? So many giving off harmful gases and destroying our home? The smog must be clouding our perception of things because we aren't thinking straight. We're destroying our planet because of money. I get off topic because the truth is here and this essay is a way to spread the truth. United as one. We can do anything. We're all equal. Nobody is better than anyone else. No country is better than any other. Anyone's beliefs do not overpower anyone else's. So yeah, cars aren't so bad, but they're not all that good either. We drive past others every day not wondering where they're going. Don't you want to know what you're doing? Yes. You! We're all the same person.

Great minds think alike huh? Well...shouldn't we address the real problem then? Money is a piece of paper. Material. Why do we need it. We PAY for food and water. The things we need to survive. I can understand why we do. But what if we worked manually for a good cause then got payed in food and supplies for that? It could work. We don't aknowledge eachother. It's like we're scared of eachother. I don't why. We're all animals trying to achieve happiness. We can do it. If people stop boxing in their beliefs and limit themselves. The mind once stretched to new ideas, will never return to its original dimensions. Expand your mind. I'm not saying do drugs. Just be more open-minded as we all go home at the end of the day and wonder what everybody else is doing. How do they live? The same as you. Our body is an extension to our soul and our mind is what puts energy out there. Imagine this, your mind is a garden. Your thoughts are seeds. Decide what you want to grow and let it be put out into the physical world.

I don't care what I make on this writing test because, maybe, just maybe my thoughts will be heard by someone who thinks the same. Studies show, there is an increasing talk about something you'd hear in a prophecy type of movie. Indigo children are being born every day into this life the government has set up for us. These children have a keen learning ability and natural IQ of 140. They won't like this new world we are forced to abide by. I, an indigo child, awoken by my own thoughts and the ignorance of this world, must say that through all the things going on out there. There is a change coming to balance out the world again. I'm about done with this because my hand is starting to cramp up. But how can a 16 year old who grew up in Fort Walton Beach, FL, know all this? It's a big world out there and there's a lot to see and I don't plan on leading a government based life. I'm going to live my life the way I want. Money in my pocket or not.

"Trying to detect someones emotions is like playing the game ""Clue"", it's a mystery and very hard to figure out. But what if there was a software that allowed a chance to put the individual infront of a camera and the thought of guessing was no longer an option, because all the answers are sitting on the screen? Professor Thomas Huang from Beckman Institute has created such a software, a software that has the ability to calculate someone's emotions much like in math class. This new software can open doors for the future, and give us new advancements in the classroom, but could it be an end to simply asking if some is okay? Could this be the end to emotional privacy, or simply emotions?

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has many promising attributes and the ability to open new doors for technology and learning environements in the future. It being able to calculate emotions as easily as math problems, could help us decode a lot of the mystery that is the human mind. The process starts wiht a 3-D computer model of the face, and contains information of all the 44 major muscles in a human face and with the help of psychologists, it can classify six emotions and associate them with movements of facial muscles. This type of technology has the ability to be used in a classroom to watch when a student is getting bored or tired to help the teacher better themselves when teaching. Or maybe even help in real world situations when someone goes in front of a jury, or even during interviews for a job. But how accurate is this new software, and how do we know we can rely on it?

The Facial Action Coding System is seemly flawless with many positive outlooks on what is instore for us in the futrue, but has two big questions sitting on its shoulders. How can we rely on this system? And how do we know that this is even an accurate reading? When thinking about someones emotions, one thinks of the individuals emotions as diverse and extremely different from everyone elses. So how can this software accurately read individual emotions around the world? Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"", he firmly believes that his new software can identify the most mixed emotions with the use of video imagery and emotion recognition. This however, still does not provide us with a good example of how we can be sure that this is a reliable way to read someones emotions and could potetially ruin human socialization and emotions toward one another.

While this new software may seem like the ""next big thing"", there are many ways that this could potentially ruin the human race. Society right now is circling around the phone, it is how we communicate, have a social life, and figure things out. It is in our way of life and we have adapted to the idea of constantly having a phone at our beck and call. So why not add in another way of relying on technology, but this one can help us figure out someones emotions, since simply asking ""Are you okay?"" is too hard and time consuming. Why not just stick them in front of a camera to have it tell them how they are feeling instead of trying to listen to how they feel and talking with one another. This new Facial Action Coding System has the ability to open many new doors, but it could close the door for human socialization.

The Facial Action Coding System is an advancement in technology and has the abilities to open and grow our future. It had the ability to help out in classroom environments and give more support during other real life situations. But with it can come the destruction of human socialization and emotions and make a total mess of how we interact with each other. While trying to figure out someones emotions is very difficult and challenging, it may be better to stick with such ways rather than completly giving up what makes us human and causing a catastrophe in the human world.",5,3,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"Driverless cars seems like a great idea doesnt it? But think about it, people in the future are not really going to know how to drive a car. Cutting the past out isnt going to help in the furure.

First of all, Getting a driverless car you still have to drive. No one wants to drive a driverless car, and thats where a lot of crashes are goin to start. A lot of people are not going to be paying attention. Especially on the highway because the car can steer, accelerste, and brake themselves but cannot drive themselve through road work. Thats where the accdient is going to happen at, if the driver is not paying attention.

Additionally, most states have made it illegal to test computer driven cars. They say the law will be tooken down once the cars are approved. But what if in some states they dont take the law down, if the driver has to go through that state to get to another, there's going to be a problem. The driver then has to drive. But the driver doesnt really know how to and they only know parts of driving because the car did the rest of that.

Also, a driverless car is a very nice kind of car. they steer it self, accelerate , and brake themselve. It can function its speed up to 25 mph. Has a special touch sensor to make sure the driver has control of the wheel. Plus has an alert system to when there is a problem ahead the car can't keep control anymore.

"Driverless cars are a newer technology that has greatly advanced in the twenty first centuary, but they are a long way away form seeing them on the road. It is evident driverless cars have a negative impact on society through safety harzards, lack of legal laws, and unreliable technology.

It is guaranteed driverless cars will be a safety threat to everyone on the road becasue they can not be trusted. Driverless cars would rely only on the car itslef to get you somewhere, and people who no longer have to drive themselves. In doing this people are no longer able to be held responsible for any crashes caused by these vehicles, because they would not be in controll of their own car. It is known that crashes would be much more likely, and this too means more death would occur. Many people will become turned away from driving on the road if they know others are not in controll of their own vehichle.

In todays society there are very few laws put in place about driverless cars, which would create many conflicts if these car were to exist on the roads. It is said in article about the intentions of traffic laws that ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This means it will be very difficult for new laws to be passed which support driverless cars since a human would not be in controll of it. New laws would need to be put into place because it is evident when it comes to accidents with driverless cars people would need to be aware of whose fault it is.

Technology will always have issues where it fails to do its intention, and this is why we can not trust it with our lives. The human brain has the ability to think in a much different way than a machine would becasue they are just robots. If these machines which run off technology were more effictive than the human brain then everyone woudl have robots doing daily activites for them. As you can tell this does not occur in our socity today, because they are unrelliable. When driving a car you have to think and predict what could possibly happen. With the human brain we have this ability, but the technology driving the car has the ability to suddenly break and then the person in the vehicle would have there life potientally harmed. It will always be more reliable if you trust human knowledge over technology.

The safety hazards, lack of legal laws, and unreliable technology are all ways driverless cars will have a negative impact on the roads. Driveless cars may seem appealing becuase of the convience of everyone have a personal taxi driver (the car itself), but the negative impact outweights the prositive impact.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Have you ever thought about what life would be like on Venus? Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star"", is said to be a challenge when it comes to exploring. The author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped.

First of all, Venus, also known to be Earths ""twin"", is a mystery. The author tells the readers about what past explorations have been like and why no one is living or has traveled to Venus in almost three decades. """"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."". The author also tells of why no space craft has been able to survive the landing on Venus. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."". However that does not stop scientist from trying to create more explorations to gain more research.

In addition to the surface being inhospitable, that does not stop scientist from planning more explorations to gain more research. The author asks us, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface?"". Well we are told that, ""Today Venus still has some features that are analogous tgo thoses on Earth."". Which tells us that even scientist are still figuring out how Earth became Earth, and if Venus was just like Earth. Which leads to more research and more information.

Finally, we are told about how a-like Earth and Venus are through the research of the scientists. Which scientist believe we should not stop our travels just because of dangers. In paragraph 8 the author states, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."". This shows that the author does not believe that the danger should hold us back and stop us from exploring. In the same paragraph it also states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

Over all, the author develops a main point that Venus is a fasinating planet by using facts on past explorations to Venus, by using what scientist have found, and by telling readers that our travels should not be stopped. By showing the readers that there is more than what meets the eye when talking about Venus. Also that one should never let danger stop them from exploring.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I think that using driverless cars are a positive thing. There are some negatives that come along, but everything has negatives with them. There are more positives to outweigh the negatives. I think it will be much safer and enviromentally friendly.

Just think about all the drunk drivers out there. With the driverless car you do not have to worry about anymore. There are also a very high amount of people that text and drive or just on there phone. That is a bg safety issue. Again, the driverless car controls everything so you will not have to worry about any crashes or accidents because of people on there phone.

It makes it easy to get places. There is a built in GPS, so the car already knows where to go. People get lost all the time because they dont know what to do or where to go. Yes the car does make the driver actually drive when there is a lot of traffic or construction, but by the time these cars come out I am sure that problem will be fixed. Even if the problem does not get fixed, the car will still have done most of the driving for you. It makes it so much easier on the people using the driverless cars.

The driverless cars are extremely safe. There are sensors all over the car to show it how close thing are, when to stop, and where to go. There is another sensor that uses satellites to give it a map out of the car on the road, and the roads at all time. That is an axtraorinary device.

The car only uses half the amount of gas that a normal car will use. That saves the owner of the driverless car a gigantic amount of money. It is also safer for the environent. If only half the normal gas amount is being used, then it is a geat thing for the Earth. There will not be as much drilling and sucking out of the gas. That will give the Earth more time to get more gas and it will last much longer for us to use.

There are some negatives with the driverles car. If there is to much traffic, construction sight, or just something the automobile cannot handle then the driver will have to take over. That is a problem because why would you need to have a driver driver a driverless car? The cars still are noot fully ready and prepared to be used yet, so that gives the manufacturers more time to fix all of the flaws. There could be technical problems with the car, but that comes with anything there is that is new. There are most likely a couple years before these cars will be ready to sell, so that leaves a lot of time to fix all the problems and flaws.

These driverless cars seem to be very safe, easy to use, easy to maintain, very helpful, and good for the environment. These driverless cars will be a ginormous help for everybody that is on the road. They are definitely a positive product for the world.",3,4,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"This article for me is kind of hard to believe. These people have never been up there to see this face on the red planet. Instead of sending a person up there to actually see it they send a machine to Mars to capture pictures of this face.

Scientist believe that this face is remains of alien structure but, do they have proof that aliens even exist? If they could get a picture of the face then why could they not get a picture of the aliens that were up there to die and have this face on face of Mars. This photo could just be a regular bump on the surface and the way the lighting is might make it look kind of like a face but, they have not yet to send anyone up there so they do not know for sure. If they really think that this is a face then they should send someone up there to capture a legit photo that is close up to prve that this face is really there. The face does not even look like a deformed creature it looks like a humans face and that is another thing that makes me not believe it. The scientist said that this face is a remain of an alien artifact but, if this is an alien than people might as well just start calling themselves aliens and aliens humans. If you look on the right side of the face you can not see anything but the shadow. This makes me wonder if it is just the lighting and makes me wonder if this bump looks like a face because of the lighting. Because if you think about it the scientist may have done that on purpose so people wouldn't say that they could not completely varify this thing but, really it looks like a bump. Also, if you look towards the bottom of the bump there is a ring around it and I do not think that scientist know exactly what aliens look like because they have never captured a photo of one, so how do they know that this is even an artifact of an alien.

These scientist probably have some notes taken on why they think this is an alien but, from the stuff that I thought about this looks more like a human than anything and they have no proof that they know what aliens look like. If they are so sure that this is a face of an alien they why did they not put a picture of an alien in the article.",1,3,2,1,0,1,1,2,0
"Professor Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois has made a great leap in technology that can recognize the emotions one might project. With his collegues, Prof. Huang developed the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS. It utilizes human anatomy to help indentify the intensity of emotions and what range of emotions one might feel. As facial emotions are universal in the muscles that are engaged to produce those emotions, having this technology in different environments can help with productivity and learning. An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, emotional aid through school counseling, and can aid in learning anatomy.

As proposed in paragraph 6, the use of FACS can allow for tailored learning through webcamera software. If the software can be used to detect the emotions on the faces of students, it can identify the emotions associated with success and frustration. If the facial scan sees that a student is struggling with an assignment or is frustrated with it, the lesson plan and the problems given can be altered to maximize what is learned as mentioned in paragraph 6 with Prof. Huang writing, ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This application can aid struggling students and familiarize students with the given material, meaning that the students can further comprehend the lesson given. For students are exceeding the requirements for the assignment, emotions of happiness could allow for students to face a challenge with tougher problems than the ones given previously.

As seen in the paragraph above, FACS can aid in online learning, but it can also help with emotional help provided by a school counselor. Though it is a profession that entails the analysis of emotion in teenagers, emotions can be tough to read for even the most experienced in the field. FACS could play a big role in identifying what emotions students might have in the name of bettering their life. As mentioned in paragraph 5, humans can differentiate between various emotions when looking at the face of an friend or family member. However, the length of that analysis can only go so far to prove what a student is feeling. Employing FACS could help counselors talk one on one with students about what problems they face in school and at home. Talking through these problems can lead to a more positive outlook on life and could allow for more engagement academically regarding the student. As a whole FACS can improve school life and culture.

Lastly, FACS can play a large role in the education of Anatomy, not only in high school, but in college as well. Paragraphs 7-9 provide simple examples of muscles involved in movements that indicate emotions from the zygomatic major and risorius to the orbicularis oculi pars plpabraeus. Utilizing the FACS can help students identify major muscles and their functions by using different emotional expressions. Since emotion is scientifically proven to be evoked by emotional expression as mentioned in paragraph 9, the results of which emotions are present can be more accurate. Having the ability to identify and associate muscles on a personal level with the aid of machinery allows for the knowledge to be kept with personal association, making FACS very important in this field of education. FACS can help memorize those muscles and retain knowledge about their function from a simple facial analysis.

An application of FACS can prove useful in a school enviroment, as it can provide tailored learning, aid in school counseling, and aid in learning Anatomy. As explored in the paragraphs above, FACS provides a wide range of oppurtunities for schools to engage in different forms of learning and measuring progress with its aid. With a universal impact in many different aspects of school life, FACS can revolutionize what teachers and counselors think is best for students. The software provides a scope of use not limited to just science, but to schools and companies who can utilize FACS for learning and for projects in the future.",4,4,3,4,2,3,3,3,3
"January 23rd, 2015

Greetings Mr. Senator,

There is one particular issue that has been boggling my brain recently. It is none other than the electoral college system. Irrational, unfair , and outdated is exactly what the electoral college system is. Isn't the virtues of American's built on foundations such as rationality, equality/fairness, and mobility? The head of the United States government isn't even elected to the standards that we, the American people, hold ourselves to.

Mr Senator, I agree with the clause ""majority rules"" to an extent, with ""winner takes all"" being on the whole other side of the ball park. If Americans had a straight voting system, meaning no electoral college, where simply stated, whichever candidate recieves the most votes wins, the process in which we elect our government head would hold truer to our values. With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The ""winner takes all theory"" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college.

Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president. According to, ""The Indefensible College"", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an acountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the ""swing states"" where they could possibly steal al of that states eleectoral college votes (lines 13-20). Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election (lines 20-21). We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there.

This neglect isn't the fault of the candidates though. Where shall i place the blame, Mr. Senator? There is no childish, frivilolus blame to be placed. Simply stated, the fault lies in our electoral college system. The candidates are just playing the game of the electoral college. The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. Are you saying that America doesn't have the time to recount votes to ensure the prosperity of the American people. Is that the messege you want to project? It sure isn't coming off well.

The certainty of outcome is ludicrous as well. Source 3, ""In Defense to the Electoral College"", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past.

Mr. Senator, I know you are a sensible man who cares about the people he represents. The people's right to vote matters, yes? Do not be so arrogant as to ignore the people who elected you. May I direct you to the preamble to our constitution? Isn't that the sole foundatio of our government? The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. A win by the popular vote is much more commendable by a landslide victory on false pretences.

Thoughtfully,

"I believe that there are many advanteges of limiting car use, people should ride bikes more or walk to places that are near by instead of driving it helps clean the world of all the pollution in the air. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving to places that are close enough helps prevent the build up of smog, also you save money on gas. Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress, and last it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey. If it is ever necesery to use a car, try car-pooling or get a taxi instead of driving yourself.

Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of the greehouse gas in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States. If people who live near stores would use bikes and would walk to the store instead of driving it would help minimize the expansion of smog. After five days of the partial driving ban in Paris the capital of france congestion (traffic) went down 60 percent, the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Also an advantage for limiting the use of cars is you save on the money you would spend on gas. you would be able to spend it on yourself or on important things like bills and groceries.

Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress levels. Peoples stress levels will come down due to the exercise they will be doing instead of driving, for exmaple in Bogota, Colombia parks and sports centers have bloomed through out their city, also not having to worry about if they they have enough money for gas will help the stress go down.

Last but not least a few other advanteges are it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey. It conserves the fossil fuels that are running out fast due to many people driving. It also helps lower emmission from the cars that people drive aroud the United states and the world, which pollutes the air and then creates smog. And it helps improve safety by haing less car sccidents and people being run over by cars. It will help by making the death rate of accidents go down.

In conclusion I believe these reasons are why there are advantages to limiting car usage, walking or riding a bike instead of driving to places that are close enough helps prevent the build up of smog, also you save money on gas. Second it helps lower pollution that is in the air and helps lower peoples stress, and last it helps to conserve energy, lower emmissions and improve saftey.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"They caluclate Mona Lisa emotional they said that she has 83 percent of happyness, 9 percent of disgusted, 6 percent of fearful and 2 percent angry. The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles then Dr. Hung relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS ( facial action coding system).

For example your frontails parslterails muscle ( above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. In a classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored at the same time technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

When feeling down look in the mirror and do these falling steps 1. rasie your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. then squit your eyes slightly to prduce wrinkling ( crow's feet) at the corners of your eyes. 3. holding that rasie the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes that you smiling as a reowned drama coach constantin stanislvsky had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emtions on stage and watching your loves one die will make you cry its the same way watching a movie of someone dieing.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
"It could be of good use. For example say you have a student that isnt having a good week. Lets say you cant fully tell if they are in a good or bad mood right. You could just bring the ""FACS"" Machinery and let that be the judge. We could also say that there are people who know how to hide emotions physically. So looking at them might let you think they are happy but really they are sad, lonely, depressed, ect. That would be another good momment for that to be there. To let you know how the person is really feeling.

There are both pros and cons to having this machine ill go over the pros first. Some pros are that you will be able to tell someones mood. Aswell as that you will be able to tell if someone is lying about there true feelings which could really be a problem when it comes to things like depression leading to suicides and things. Finally being able to know someones emotions could work to your favor as a teacher say someone is confused but to shy or scared to ask. Use the ""FACS"" machine to get them out of there. Some cons would be things like it could take priceless time out of your teaching to use the machine. They didnt give a estimate of how long it takes but i'd expect it to be a pretty long time. Also it could take a big price hit on the schools around the nation, I couldnt imagine this being a cheap device. Finally it could be useless. Some teachers wont take time out of their class to use it because frankly they just dont/wont care. Which would be a total bust seeing that the school would waste so much money just for it to go to waste.

I honestly think its amazing how someone can tell you how they are feeling at that moment. The diversity must be off the walls. it must be 1 in a million to get the same feeling. Its crazy the things we can do now a days with technology. People are coming up with more and more ways to initiate a more satisfactory lifestyle. Its always good to see someone take that inititive and start something like this. Seeing this I wonder what could be next.",2,2,1,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Have you ever had an opportunity to go to europe and help people in need?

First,some reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discoverd. For example,if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which means you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because,you can discover some amazing things. For example, you could see places like europe,china,italy and greece. Also you will be helping a lot of people and animals because,you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next,but for me being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure.''It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it made me look at the world diffrent it might be the same to you or even an acheivment you have accomplished. Their are some reasons you might be scared to go. For example you might be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what your supposed to you wont fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World war 2 was over in europe and many countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRRA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses,young cows,and mules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRRA said that means you probly would be getting paid. Even if you dont get paid its still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion,all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about and it will make you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people,animals,and enviorment. I hope from all the reasons I have given you,you'll join the seagoing cowboys program.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In many places, people drive cars. We know that driving a vehicle can lead to all kinds of pollution because of the fuel we use to power them. Because of this reason, people have decided to stop driving their cars, or take time off from driving them. Places such as Germany, America, and even Paris, France, have stopped using their vehicles as frequently.

In Vaubun, Germany, many have given up their cars and have deicded to walk to where they need to go. Their streets are completely ""car free"", except where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and some streets on one edge of the community. You are allowed to own a car, but you can only park at the edge of a development, but you have to buy a space for $40,000, along with your home. for this reason, 70 percent of the population does not own a car and 57 percent sold their car to move to Vaubun. Some families say they're much happier wtihout a car.

In Paris, France, a partial driving ban has been enforced. On some days, motorists with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home or they would suffer a fine. Then the next day this would apply to people with an odd numbered car. Almost 4,000 people where fined and twenty-seven people had their cars impounded. This ban was enforced because of the amount of smog that is in Paris.

Pollution is a very bad issue, and people driving cars do not help at all. All of the driving is very bad and it needs to be stopped. Programs which stop people from driving cars is very helpful. The partial bans on cars and banning them completely will definetly help the world, the air, and humans too!",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I think limiting car usage is a great idea for america. Studies show that in Bogota, ""the people are generating a revolutionary change."" Says Enrique Riera, the major of Asuncion, Paraguay. People are either walking to their destinations or riding their bicycles. Also the less you use your car, means less air pollution everywhere so the Earth is more healthier.

Limiting car usage could also help people's physical and mental health. Walking could lower your stress levels and let you think about the nature that you see instead of thinking about what your mad at. I know this from experience because I get stressed very easilyand walking anywhere helps me calm down. Another thing about limiting car usage is that the car wreck percentage would be lower than it is right now. There would also be less deaths in the world if they limited the usage of cars.

Did you know that there are aproximently 118 miles of bicycle paths only in Bogota? Well there is and acording to Mockus, the city's major, ""It's the most of any Latin American city."" Also you could use the bicycle paths as walking paths for exercise or just to walk anywhere. People would be in more shape if they limited cars. But the only bad thing about using a car in Vauban, Germany is that you have to pay for the car and a spot to keep it whie only being able to drive it on the main throroughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs.

In conclution I think it would be a great idea for America to go car-free.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"That venus is like a sister or most likely like a twin. "" venus is actually a planet. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. "" ( prg.1 ).

These conditins are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to driving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additionals impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to lans on its surface.""

Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"". ( prg.6 ).

"Do you want to be able to feel more safe while you are in the car? If you answered yes, then you might want a car that can senses all the dangers that's surrounding you before you can. Car is a great transportation to go to places, so it's important that you are safe while you're in the car. Diverless cars are being develop; driverless cars are cars that can drive itself without you touching the steeling wheel.

While you are in a car, it is important that you're safe from all dangers that is surrounding you.Most cars company are developing driverless cars, meaning that the car can drives itself without you even touching the steeling

wheel. Almost every cars have safety featers. For example, in paragraph 4 it said, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" All these sensors will help you be more safe while you are in the car.

Another good thing about driverless cars in the furture is that the car would use half the fuel of today's taxi system and offer far more flexibility than a bus. Another good reason to have driverless cars in the furture is that, say that you are going on a vaction and you are driving about 4-5 hours, but you don't want to take a rest before you would slow down the time of getting there; so by having a driverless car, you can set the car to drives itself while you can relex and rest for a bit. After you got some rest and feel better, you can set the driverlss mode off and you continued driving.

Cars that can detect dangers before you can it's important feater to have. In paragraph 7 it said that "" In 2013, BMW announed the development of "" Traffic Jam Assistatn."" The car handle drivong functions at speeds up tp 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" this means that the car will help the driver focus on the road. Also in paragraph 7 it said that "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves."" meaning that if you are not paying attention the car can stop itself before an accident happens.

So yes developing driverless cars is a good idea in the future. It has a lot of safety featers that can help to stop an accident before it happens. it's important that you are safe while you are in the car. Most of cars company is developing cars that can drives itself without you even touching the steeling wheel.",3,2,2,1,0,0,1,1,0

"Although there are many challenges to face in exploring Venus, the biggest one is ourselves.

We have let our imagination overtake what we want.

we can imagine crazy, bizard things; but that does not mean we can have them.

And once we let our imagination take control, we lose.

We lose what we actually want and trade it in for what we can imagine and know we cannot have.

But our imagination is not the only thing getting in the way.

Exploring Venus is a very risky task.

With temperatures higher than 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure ninety times greater than anything we can ever experience on Earth.

The real question is, ""Is exploring Venus worth the risks?""

Well of course it is!

Every single thign we do has its risks, but that does not stop us from doing things.

We should not turn down an opportunity to explore the great universe we live in simply based of hardships.

Just becasue it is hard does not mean is it impossible.

Venus is the closest planet we have to ourselves.

In paragraph two, Venus is reffered to as '""Earth's 'twin'.""

Venus is the closest thing we have to know what our Earth may or may not turn into.

It is the only thing we can compare ourselves to.

If the conditions on Earth turn into those of Venus, exploring Venus only brings us life.

We can not take away life just because it gets hard!

The fact that it is hard is what should be pushing us to keep exploring.

There is so much we can learn from Venus that we do not even know and probably will not be able to comprehend.

So that is why we need to explore Venus.

We need to explore so that we can learn more about the place we live and the places around us.

Venus is our neighbor, we need to know that our neighbor is safe.

If we do not protect Venus, we are not protecting ourselves.

Through all of the hardships and dangers, we need to keep pursuing to get to Venus.

The more we learn about Venus, the more we can compare and contrast and see if the conditions on Earth are anything like those of Venus.

If we give up on our neighbor, we give up on ourselves.

Venus deserves to be explored and we, as a nation, deserve the chance to explore it.

Not just for the bettering of Venus, but also for the future of Earth.

We need to let our imagination run wild, as well as our spirit!",1,3,1,2,1,2,1,2,2
"The use of the technology that can read emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be extremly valuable. This technology would be so valuable because it would not only help teachers see when students are confused or lost but then the computer could modify the lesson to help the student learn the best way possible. Plus this technology is active and working right now.

The use of technology to read emotions would greatly benifit students. It would allow teachers to provide even more help when a student is struggling with the assiginment or the lesson. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, has been working on a way for a computer monitor to read human emotions. Dr. Huang says that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for every student to learn in the best way possible, because when their is only one teacher, that said teacher will only teach the lesson one way and expect everybody to learn it that one way. Although in reality everybody learns differently, some students learn best through hands on learning while others may learn the best through seeing examples of how to do the disired task. The point is that, everybody learns differently and if a computer can modify each lesson to fit the learning styles of students, students would not only learn better and faster, they may also enjoy learning a little bit more. Which would then help with attendance issues and people not wanting to go to school because it just being ""dumb"" or not fun. Plus this technology is also already working and has been improved on. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" written by Nick D'Alto in 2006, says that, ""She’s 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" D'Alto is refering to the Mona Lisa painting. These said percents, 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, etc, were only able to be obtained through the latest innovation on a new computer software. (Keep in mind that the article was written in 2006.) With technology that can read emotions extremly well in 2006, just imagine how much farther it can come in 12 years. The technology has been sure to have advanced, to it being even accurate. This would teachers to know what students are thinking and how they can help them or how the computer can modify the lesson for the student to help them learn in the best way possible.

With technology becoming more advanced by the day, why not advance the technology in our classroom's to help benifit the students. The use of technology to read a sudents emotions would grealty benifit the student and if it is benifiting the student why not use it. If this new technology helps students learn better and faster would'nt it be wrong for it not to be used. If this technology is available for schools, schools should invest it this technology to help the student learn faster and quicker.",2,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Dear State Senator,

Once a year, people all over the United States of America gather to vote for the most powerful men in the country; our President and Vice President.  We should have the people of America be able to vote for who they want their president to be because the Electoral College has some major flaws and simply because people have their rights.  I believe that we should let the people be able to make their own choices.

The Electoral College has major flaws.  Something bad is bound to happen if we keep letting them make the people's decisions.  Source A in paragraph 12 states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way.""  The election is literally only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe.  It would be hard to believe that the people of the United States would want to be embarrassed because we can't even choose a presidential leader correctly.  The other countries would take us as a joke; we would simply look like fools.  Another thing is, what would we do if there were a tie in the electoral vote.  Source B also in paragraph 12 says, ""Perhaps the most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.""  And with that being said, the election would be taken to the HOR (House of Representatives), where state delegations vote on the president.  And because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing only 500,000 voters, would have much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represents 35 million.  That is the same population as Wyoming only times 70.  That is a tremendous difference in population.  Don't let our country plummit into bad election.  If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it.

Ever since our founding fathers have settled here in America and made the Decloration of Independence in the late 1700s, the Amendments, and everything that gives us the right to be free, the people have had the right to vote.  With the Electoral College, the people of America will not be able to freely use that right.  Source C says, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have a chance of winning, focusing only on the right races in the ""swing"" states.""  Seventeen states didn't even see the candidates during the campaign in 2000.  Those states including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  Voters in the 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see not one, not two, but zero campaign ads.  Just as Source D states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse.""  The state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and keep in mind that those electors possibly could defy the will of the people.  What if a state sends two state of electors to Congress?  It happened in 1960 with Hawaii and luckily VP Richard Nixon validated only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent.""  What if it happened again?  Remember when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency to George W. Bush?  Thank that to the electoral college.  In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gore recieved more individual votes that George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election recieving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266.  This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidency.  And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.  But why?

First of all, Source E states, ""So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small one does.""  But the problem with this is is that it's simply unfair.  The smaller states should get just as much attention as the bigger states do.  This is like saying that on the baseball field, the bigger and stronger kids should be the ones picked first and be able to play but the smaller kids don't get to play.  It is not fair to the people in the smaller states like Wyoming, to be considered not as good as the state of California.  Also in paragraph 20 of Source F says, ""They are the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have recieved the most information and attention from the candidates), and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""  Once again, this statement is unfair.  This is favoritism.  This is saying that the better and bigger states should get all the attention just because they are more ""thoughtful"".  Once again, people deserve to have their rights so I say, let them vote.

People want to make their own decisions.  It's who we are as a person we want to be able to have responsibilities; we want to feel important.  With the electoral college we won't be able to get that feeling because we feel we aren't important enough to vote.  So it's official.  The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.  And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best.  Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind that we have now and there's a pretty good reason.  It's fair.  There's only one thing I have to say to you.  State Senator, please abolish the electoral college.

Sincerely,

"It is equivalent to a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west. Garvin says that its just the shading of the area that makes it look like a face. Over the years the face changes it starts to change shape or crust over and because of that it makes it look like a natural landform. NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars. They most likely sent out on the web to stir up peoples thoughts and to make them nervous about if there really is life on mars.

In 1976 you can sort of tell that there is a face on the rock formation. In 1998 you can really tell that there is a face there, but you can also see a change in lighting which because of that you can see the face more. In 2001 there is no lighting like the first one but its at a different angle so with the lighting on the second one it blocks out the cracks so its ageing over time and that proves that its a rock formation.",1,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"The electoral college is our countries way of voting, but we need to change that and what i mean by that is that i think we need to have our voting system on the peoples popular vote, for many reasons first off, easy to comprehend you dont have to be nervous and accedently vote on someone different you can obviously see who your voting on. secondly, president can win just by popular vote and not worry about the electoral college votes.

To start off, the electoral college is confusing when i first learned about it i could barely understand, but when your voting on a president you dont have to worry about voting on the wrong person because you vote and your states vote is different. also when you vote by poular vote you chboose who you want to be president and not worrying about your states vote. also theyr'e aren't any hassels involved like understanding how the electoral college works. also the vote that you cast can not be who you wanted due to the elctoral college because you cast a vote on the electors and they vote which isn't fair to the people because they could vote for someone toltally different then what you wanted.

In addition, the nominees for president now can get popular vote and still loose which isn't fair to the people and the nominee because he can get tricked and the people do to which is cruel. also if if i was a nominee i would wrather win by a popular vote becacuse it means the people get to vote for who they wanted instead of a elector and it means the people really wanted me as a president so it shows that they wanted me and that i win by there election vote. now instead of that we have a system to where i could be running and get popular vote and loose which is cruel and unright to the people cause it means they wanted me.

To conclude, the elctoral college is our countries way of voting but i would wrather have the president win by popular vote because first, easy to comprehend and you get who you wanted to vote for. secondly, you dont have to worry about winning popular vote then loose cause you didn't win electoral vote.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear State Senator,

After experiencing the dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote in 2000 I realized that the Electoral College is an old fashioned and unfair voting system for our next presidents. The vote of all United States citizens should be taken account but with each state only getting a single vote it is highly inethical for a state with 500,000 voters like Wyoming and a state with 35 million voters like California having the same amount of votes.

The candidates who of course want to win will want to spend there time campaigning in states they think they have a chance of winning over but what about states that they do not think will vote for them? States like South Carolina and Rhode Island during the 2000 campaign didn't even see the candidates at all. This all because of the winner take all system established in the Electoral College.

There are people who still support the electoral college but on what end? They say it has a more certainty of outcome but there have been past cases where the electoral college almost hit a tie. In my opinon the odds of defult outcome in Electoral College is the same as the odds there would be in popular vote for the United States

Past presidents like Bod Dole, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter even agreed to destory the Electoral College. If even presidents want to abolish the Electoral College then what is stopping us from doing so. It's time we make a change to this irrational way of voting and start valuing the opinons of each United States citizen. The only way to do this is to start having direct elections and stop using the Electoral College way of voting. I am positive that this will have a positive affect on how people look up to the government because it will finally make them feel that the government values there opinons.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

"Is Facial Action Coding System valuable to students? Do you even know what a Facial Action Coding System is? Well, it is a program or a system that was made from codes to help a computer identify human emotions. Well, I think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students. The reason I think this is because your video games could have more expressive faces, your PC at home can't handle the complex algorithms, and it can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

The first reason is that your video game could have more expressive faces. Some people enjoy playing video games a lot but what is the point in having this fun video game if your going to have faces that look like they are mad in the game. If the charcaters in game could show expression I think it would make a lot more people into the game. If more people like the video games just because they got expressions then a lot of more people will start buying games. Which means that the gaming stores will get more money, and then the government would get more money. So in conlcusion one of the reasons why it is valuable to kids is because it could make video game charcaters have expressions.

The next reason is that your PC at home can't handle the complex algorithms. The computer system that was designed by Prof. Thomas Huang made the program for a sufficicated computer that can handle the algorithms. Your PC at home was designed not to hold complex stuff on it, it was designed to hold simple stuff. So, if a teacher got this in their classroom then it could benefit the kids and they would probably have a PC that could hold the complex algorithms unlike the ones at the kids home. Therefore, another reason is that your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms.

The last reason is that a classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Having this system on a classroom computer would help the kids out a lot. The reason I say that is because what if there is a kid strugggling really bad to understand the problem they are working on but are too shy and embarassed to ask the teacher for help. What are they going to do then, just take a bad grade and deal with? But, if they have the system on the computers in their classroom then the computer can just read their facial expression, see they are confused, and then help them by pulling up a helpful website. Also if the kid is bored and the computer reads that then they can pull up a helpful website for the material that they are working on but is also a website that they can play games on. This shows that the coding system also can help students in a classroom if they are bored or confused.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to students in a classroom because your video games could have more expressive faces, your PC at home can't handle the complex algorithms, and it can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This system can help these kids in a lot of ways. I think this system will be effective and useful for students in classrooms. Facial Action Coding is a good thing for kids and should be in schools everywhere.",3,2,0,3,0,0,1,1,1
"Do you think driverless cars are a good idea? Yes or No? Driverless cars can have positive effects and negative effects. The cars could change the world or they could not end well.

Driverless cars are not a good idea at all.

The reason is, because the cars really are not fully driverless. if you are in a constrution zone or near an accident the car has you take over. The car isn't full capable of handling driving in a situation like that. The car lets the driver know when they should take over. So the question is "" If the car is driverless how come you have to take over in certain situations""? Why can't the car handle it all on its own since the car is smart? For the driverless cars to be very smart they need a bunch of sensors.

My postion on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. They can't fully handle all situations. Also if the person behind the wheel is drunk or worse and they come upon a bad accident "" What will they do""? "" How will they act""? Since the car can't handle itself and the driver is incoherent I dont think the ending result will be very good at all.

First off, the driver of the car must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed. If there is an accident or the wiring or technology fails in the car.

"" Who is blamed""? ""Do you blame the driver or the maufacturer""? Even though the traffic laws would be changed, according to the driverless cars there would be new laws put in to cover liability in a situation if there was an accident. Also there are special sensors that make sure the driver keeps his hands on the wheel.

Do you think driverless cars are a good idea? Yes or No? Driverless cars are not a good idea at all. My position on driverless cars is I think they are a bad idea. First off, the driver must stay alert at all times and be ready to take over if needed.",2,3,1,2,1,2,1,2,2
"Driverless cars are a new develpment for the future. Driving these cars is known to be a better, and safer way to drive while on the road. Many car manufatures have started to develop cars with many tools that could help drivers who own driverless cars. It is a benefit for new drivers and experienced drivers on the road.

As new drivers learn the rules to the road, they sometimes get intimidated and scared of the multiple events around them. For example, there may be loud honking from cars and trucks, accidents getting cleaned up, or construction workers at work. Driverless cars can help solve this problem as more people engage in them. Although it wouldn't be required to drive in a driverless car, people are still to be cautious and alert while in the car so they could take over when things start to get challenging and out of the car's ability. Having a driverless car is safer than having a manual-driven car.

Driverless cars can cause less accidents for many drivers. For example, in the 21st century, a majority of people are on their cell phones because of work or talking to a family member or friend. Sometimes they feel that they have a very important email or text message to send and the message can't wait. They pick up their phone and shoot them a quick message and by the time they look back at the road, they are too late. They had already ran into another car.

Most deaths on the road are caused by texting and driving. Driverless cars are said to be safer because they have certain gadgets that help the driver know when to take over and when there is danger ahead. For example, driverless car manufatures developed dirver's seats that vibate when the vehicle is too close to an object while backing up. Having that source of warning can help the person in the driver seat know when to take over. Another example is the in'car entertainment and information system. This replaces the need to text and drive, which is something not available to people who own manually-driven cars. This develpment is safer than the cars we use today.

As this new develpment is processed, there are many ways that driverless cars could help people who are in a hurry to go places and have many things to do. For example, if someone is in a rush to get to work and their tie is not tied or their make up is not done, they could just start the car and not worring about driving and waiting until they get to a stop light to finish getting ready. With all the gadgets that the driverless car has, it benefits the many people who are used to running late.

Driverless cars benefit people of all ages, who can drive. New drivers will have more confidence as they go on the road for the first time and experienced drivers could finaly relax in a way that they haven't before in a car that requires manual driving. Driverless cars are in ways safer that many manual cars that are sold today. Although there are many steps to make this new develpment officialy real, and with the help of new technology, it can happen real soon.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains that researching and exploring Venus is a risky challenge to do due to the dangers of it, but he says that it would be worthy to do it.

So the dangers of Venus is that each previous mission was umanned and that was for a good reason. ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (Paragraph 2). The atmosphere of it is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

But even though that there are these dangers on Venus Astronomers are not going to stop with this. Venus must of had been like Earth once before in the solar system. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Paragraph 4). The planet has a rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters that are on Earth today.

So the question is what are the choices that is going to both keep the mission safe and scientific productive? Well The National Aeronautics and Space Administration known as NASA has an idea to this solution. Since there is terrible conditions on the surface of Venus. The only was to survive is to be above the ground. So the idea is that having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape. Thus, even being above it would still be hot around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be kind of like Earth's sea level. And there would be plentiful solar power. And since sending elctronics there would melt it mechanical machines would withstand the dangers of Venus.

Overall, Venus is a dangerous planet and dangerous conditions. Thats not going to stop us to explore Venus. Our curosity drives us to do it.",2,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,1
"Driving is one of the most dangerous everyday things that we do, and we dont need computors to help make it anymore dangerous. In this article they bring up the possibility of having hands free driving. This is a subject that has been tested and fantasized by humans for quite awhile now. Google has had this technology since around 2009, and has allowed them to test it. However in these tests the cars have not been truely fully aoutmated my a computer. There has been a driver behind the seat everytime.

The tests that have taken place have proven that the computors have the capability of driving under the circuiumstances that they were presented with, but if they still require the driver to be alert whats the point? The time that the car has spent driving still required the driver to remain alert behind the wheel once it ran into issues. I belive that this is just a tool that is asking for trouble. Most people dont have trouble driving by themselves, and this tool is just another peice of technology that is going to make us more lazy. I feel like there are far more chances for the computors to calculate wrong or malfunction and possibly hard or kill the passengers and drivers behind the wheel as well as others on the road.

I feel like people might also be misinformed if this was ever released into the public, and feel like the computor is to be doing all the work, but as of right now thats not the case. This can ultamitly lead to more accidents and deaths behind the wheel. As The article states if this were to happen who's really to blame the driver or the manufacurer? This leads to more issues than conveniences in my opinion, and could do far more damge to large companies that would be relasing this hardware into the world. There would need to be a total redesign of safety laws and additions to the laws that are already in place.

In conclusion i dont feel like cars need an autopilot feature because it has more cons than pros at this point, and is a danger to the public until tested on for a longer period. Im not against it in the future possibly, but at this point in time its far too dangerous and adds to the chaos that is already in place on the roads. Hopefully by the time that tesla releases their vehicle they have done enough testing to make sure that its as safe as possible.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,2,1

They had fun work,Luke was a watch man witch is not as hard as othere jobs. But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than a adventure for Luke. It opened up his world

Luke probably liked helping with the animals,because He helped his grandmother with her farm. Luke helped horses,young cows,and mules. When that was over it opened his world and his heart.

"I beileve that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports the idea of studying Venus because the author says that Venus could have been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system and the curiosity researchers have to Venus, but thinking about the dangers and doubts that can occur. In paragraph 4 it says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""

The author talks about how NASA has a idea for sending humans to go study Venus and has a possible solution to do that, but it will be risky. In paragraph 5 it says, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Vernusian landscape. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.""

Another reason, the author talks about how NASA and researchers are working on other ways to study Venus, doing innovations to contribute the knowledge of Venus, and doing comparsions on how it will affect them or improve on while thinking of studying Venus. In paragraph 7 it says,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditons. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

In conclusion, the author explains some of the ways researchers think about when wanting to explore Venus. They also think about the consequences, but really thinking on how to overcome them. This is a challenge and also a valuable way to gain curiosity and information about Venus. In paragraph eight it says,"" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" This is why I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents with the supporting details of the author.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"If I were a scientist at NASA and I was disucussing the Face with someone who doesn't think the Face was just landformation I would say, it is because of what other scientist in NASA believe it was a landformation that looked like a real human face.

The Face was just something formed by the planet because the artical says, ""huge rock formation... which resemles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Which means that is was just a rock that was formed a different way to look like it was a face. Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, but there were more scientist to prove them wrong. Another piece of evidence was when they were taking pictures Garvin said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of the butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. This evidence goes with my argument because if it was some type of alien siglnal the camera would of picked it up and they would of seen what it really was, but they didn't all they saw was a landform like the ones around American West.

In conclution it was not an alien signal, or artifact, it was just a piece of land formed differently. Now you all know it wasn't from aliens. All it was, was an illusion that looked like a real human face with a nose, eyes, and more. Don't assume everything on other planets are always from aliens because for now we don't have proof aliens exist.",2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

belives that exploring Venus is a worthy challenge despite its challenges. Based on how they have written this article I can say the that the author succeeded at laying out his claim and evidence.

The author starts off by stating facts about the star in our sloar planet from nicknames, temperature, as well as atmoshpere. The text states "" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky"". the author also states "" on the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet"".

Later on in the passage the author starts to ask the reader a

questions and provides answers to them. The text sates"" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"". and answers with "" Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, moutains, and craters"". This body paragraph is another eason why I believe that the author provided a good claim.

The author then continues to NASA's ideas on further exploring the harsh surfaces of Venus. The suthor states "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"". Then gives more detail about the process. The text states"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"".

The author then discusses the problems about the idea that NASA has come up with and the other possible solutions for exploring Venus's harsh surface. The passage states"" peering at Venus from a ship or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limit insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffectve. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". The author also states"" NASA is working on other aproaches to studying Venus.

"Driveless cars shouldnt be allowed there a bad sign of bad luck to anyone who drives them at all. They are also not safe even though some people think they are. Think about it why would you want a car if your not really driving it??? What type of sense does that make thats the whole point of having a car and your license is to drive your car. If your not driving it then you should have it its really a waste of money if you buy it. Driveless cars are a bad idea and there not safe.

First of all they can cause a wreck and as it said in the article if somebody gets into a wreck who can they blame it on. The driver, or the car who knows who acually did it. And what if its the cars fault what if it catchs a glicth or something. What if the car has a glicth and blows up who's fault is that the person who made it right??? Who's gonna pay for the persons funneral if they so happen to die.

No one knows you see regular cars dont catch glitch. Regular cars dont drive there selfs because the person behind the wheel drives the car not the other way around. Thats the whole point of them making a car is for transportation but what is the point of having a machine drive you around and thats the whole point of you buyin it. Is for you to have fun driving it if you make driveless cars then teenagers are going to think that they dont need a license to drive a car. There going to get in the car and let the car drive them around.

Theres no fun in buying the car if you cant drive it thats why you bought the car. Whats the point in getting your license if your not the one driving. And also if you havent noticed your putting your life in the hands of a machine. Also 90 mph is fast if you didnt know 90 mph can kill somebody in a mature of seconds if that car gets a glicth.

This whole idea should just go out the window because it cost alot of money to build a car. And now by them trying to build a car that can drive itself is going to cost even more money. Also what if a old person is driving the car and they see the windsheild wipers blink. That could cause and accident real quick who knows whats going or in there head when they see that they could get scared and start swerving. And these are some reasons why they shouldnt make driveless cars.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"So to start here is a letter to my state senator, in which I argue in favor of keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.

The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportion representation"".

Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.

Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.

The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.

Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. Okay to end my letter, my con conclustion is that this is my letter to my state seator.",0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

One of the reasons is because of the opportunties you have to discover new places . This is a lifetime opportunity and we want you to join us . I have been to so many wonderful places like Greece , China , Panama and Europe . Imagine if you could get the chance to go there, would you say yes to the opportunity?

You don't just get to see beautiful landmarks but you also get to help people who's homes , cities and towns were destroyed and left in ruins. To them , for helping there homes recover you would be a hero . You can take care of animals when you are on seas . Those animals are shipped to the people who's homes were destroyed .

Thats not just what you do on the job you also get to mentally help yourself . I saw the poor families that lost almost everything during World War II . You will understand that you are lucky enough to have a strong and protective country that protects you from enemies . It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. And that awareness stayed with me, leading my family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years .

You really won't find it boring because Don Reist and I came up with thing to do during trips. For example we played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed after they were unloaded . We also played table-tennis tournaments, fencing,boxing, reading, whittling and other games that helped pass the time. You can also be creative and make up your own games .

"Benefits Without a Car

Could you imagine your life without a car? It seems impossible if cars wouldn't exist. Did you know that there are cities where people have'nt used their cars for a whole day? While in others people dont ever use cars. People think that without a car they're nothing, and that life is totally different. But there is something very interesting happening around us, in other countries which is the reason why they've stopped using cars for a while. The polluted air due to cars in doing no good for us. Think about it, maybe you could might live without are car for a day for an important cause.

First thing first, we should learn how people live in other countries without a car. It sounds weird to us, but it's something normal for them. There is forbidden to have home garages and to park cars on street in Vauban, Germany. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has gone from a city with cars to people giving up their cars. ""street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss borders""(Rosenthal, paragraph 2). This place is ""car free"" except for the downtown area and a few streets of the community. She also states that other countries like the US experiments more problems in pollution.""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50%

in some car-intensive areas in the US""(5). People walk way more in Europe, they dont suffer much from air pollution.

Additionally, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. These cities have stopped using their cars for a while to help calm the air pollution. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)"" (Robert Duffer, paragraph 11). Although that people were not supposed to us ehtier cars that day, 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. The cause for not driving for that day was because the cold nights and warm days caused the air to trap car emissions. Another reason for car free in Paris is because of the micrograms found. ""Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London, Rueters found""(Duffer, 17). Its an advantage to prevent car usage because the smog is clearing in these cities.

In similarity, millions of Colombians hiked, walked and did many other activities without touching a car to prevent the smog. These cities are working together to make the world a better place. ""In a program that set's to spread to toher countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday""(Andrew Selsky, paragraph 20). The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog, and they achived it. That day without a car was an improvement camapign in Bogota. Surprsingly, in the US recent studies have stated that Americans are buying fewer cars and driving less each year that goes by. ""if the pattern persists- and many sociologists believ it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emmisions and the environment""(Elizabrth Rosenthal, paragarph 34). There has also been changes in the US. Driving less has stopped air pollution.

In conclusion there are benefits without a car. Benefits for the world around us, and well you might get some stress out if you start walking, hiking, or riding bycicles for a while. It's incredible just to think of the idea that many countries have stopped driving for a day to make their country or city a better place. While in cities like Vauban, Germany people live without cars. Thats what makes their city different. Even though they do also let these things happen for a right cause. I think that we could live without a car for one day, it's not a big deal, really. It's to make the US a better place.",3,2,3,3,0,1,1,1,0
"After releasing the photographs about a mesa on Mars or now known as the ""Face of Mars"", theories have come up claiming that it is in fact a face of an old extraterrestial. This is completely false claim that has no evidence or support to be supported with. This mesa is a common natural landform that can be found commonly around. This is a mesa that happens to look like a face. Although it can look pretty convincing and decieving, it's something common. Like mountains on Earth, it's something that triggers your brain claiming it to be something it isn't. It's like seeing a shadow pass by the corner of your eye! You claim you saw it, but it was just a fragment of your imagination. It's something our brains trigger.

As it states in the article, praragraph two and three, it states that the face the public saw was just an illusion forming eyes, a mouth, and a nose. ""There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" This sentence supports the claim that the face was a simple fargemnt of the brain creating an illusion of something. It's a common landform that naturally is created. Although many theorist's claim that it had to do something with aliens and extraterrestrials, there is no evidence to support or back up that claim. Where else have you seen something out of the normal on Mars? Where there any prints or traces leading to something else? People just need to understand that it's was a landform and a landform only. In paragraph three, it supports the claim that the face was a natural landform. ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation. . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.' The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Not only did the face gain notorious fame, but the story got a lot of publicity and gained a lot more attention than it should have. All the face was was an illusion that the brain of many created. Although many knew it was a natural landform, many supporting those scientists wanted the outcome of the story to take a COMPLETELY different turn! Many wanted the face to be the result of an ancient civilization on Mars, which also couldn't be possible. There were a lot of crazy theories and rumors, but the truth was the one that people denied to believe in.

This story took many turns, twists, accusations, false claims, and more incredible stuff made up by the public. Although it was a simple landform, many denied that to the core, and many defended that statement with their live's. The simple truth of this whole mess, is that it was a photograph taken of a natural landform near Cydonia, that was mistaken as a face with eyes, nose, and mouth by the illusions of many theorists or confused and intruiged viewers. To think the public thought a landform would be a face.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"My position on driverless cars would be that i think we should not have them! Why? Well because everything has it's up's and down's but some are more important to life than others. Some of the technology used for driverless cars would be helpful.

First off if you are in a driverless car and it wrecks or has a malfunction is it going to save you or put you in the hospital, and who woyld be at fault? It is easier to control the outcome of something if you are in control of whatever it may be. If you were in a vehical that you actually have to drive you can catch on quicker and prevent wrecks and damage. Either way you go weither you're driving or the car is you still have to be focused on the road to prevent accidents. Plus think about all the people that will be put out of jobs, and how it will not only impact us but our income and environment too.

For example: "" If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or manufacturer?"" This quote does not only point out that driverless cars can be more dangerous but that no matter what humans are still required to stay focused and take responsibility. Whats the point in having a driverless car when you have to worry about staying focused and be at fault for a wreck if technology fails. I'd rather drive a regular vehical to where i won't have to worry about technology failing or relaxing while the car drives and wake up in the hospital with a fine.

Driverless cars would be better because it gives you time to get some coffee in, eat, or contact someome whom you need to catch up with but don't normally have the time. You won't have to worry about wrecks because driverless cars warn you ahead of time so you are prepared. Stressed out? Well than you can relax while your driverless car takes you where you need to go. These cars can navigate, drive, us the breaks, and alert you.

Driverless cars would be taking a huge risk. Why? well because technology can crash at any given time and especially during big storms. What is more important relaxing or being safe? Therefore i would drive a regular car it is safe where a driverless care is not. I would rather take the risk of driving myself than having to worry about something not functioning right because the technology went out or is not processing right!",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In this story, the author talks about how humans are capable of landing on Venus and checking the planet out. He states that there are many dangers like the high atmospheric pressure Venus has, and that Venus has the hottest temperature surface in all of the planets. Each mission they had was unmanned, and no space craft survived a landing for more than a few hours. The author supports his claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers bad because he explains that there are more dangers than possibilities and they have just conducted research and never tried or invented anything he states yet.

NASA says they could create a blimp- like vehicle that hovers about 30 or so miles above Venusian landscape. This would work out because they have liveable conditions from where they are floating at, but they couldn't do anything with the info they get. When they are 30 miles above the ground it makes it difficult because most forms of light can only cover the dense atmosphere. The text states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This is saying that scientists wouldn't be able to take substances form Venus back home to the US and the scientists would mainly have to explain all there observations from sight. The author also talks about how scientists are working on innovations and certain inventions that have not happend yet so he can't explain more details on how they could make it to Venus but many things have to be innovated first.

NASA is also working on other approaches to get to Venus, but we can't start sending people to Venus if we don't even know if the invention or approach could work. There are more dangers than ways to get to Venus safely in this article so that is also a reason why I think he does a bad job supporting his claim. Venus to me is not really worth researching for just because of those conditions that the planet has, but if the blimp-like thing works out, I still think the scientists wouldn't be able to see what they wanted and get no good evidence. Like I said, pictures and any light source would be hard to get when you're in Venus. NASA and other researchers should focus on a different planet than Venus because It would be way to difficult to get people there, yet alone get reseach from Venus.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Venus, the second planet from the sun, can be seen shining bright in the sky. However, not much is known about the neighboring planet. The authors uses information about Venus and possiblities for the future to help support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Venus is referred to as the earth's ""twin."" Though Venus could not be any more different than Earth, it poses a possibility that it may have been similar in the past. ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" (paragraph 3). ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (paragraph 4). To explore Venus and find connections of Venus to Earth could lead to future breakthrough of a habital planet.

To show the exploration of Venus might not just be empty hope, he proposes ideas atronomers may have to analyze the planet. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (paragraph 5). However, this may restrict close observations, especially since limited light can penetrate the planet's atmosphere. To solve this problem, the author proposes another solution. To overcome the delicacy of modern computers, astronomers are thinking of going back in time and using mechanical ones. ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (paragrah 7).

In the passage, the author presents both solutions to complications with the mission and possible breakthroughs that the mission might bare. Either by staying out of range of Venus's atmosphere or using mechanical computers, the hardships of surviving on the harsh planet could be overcome. The rover or blimp may bring back valuable information that may indicate a Earth-like haven from back in time. With endless hope and possibilities, the author has shown the worth of a mission to Venus.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Pardon me, but i would like to disagree with you. What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The Face on Mars is just a natural land form. The Face on Mars is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Just like we have many lanforms here on Earth, infact there is a lanform in Idaho. It is located in The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain, is what reminds me most of the Face on the planet Mars. We have more lanforms like the Face on Mars in the American West.

Conspiracy theorists say that the people of NASA are hiding the evidence of life on Mars. I mean think about about it, why would we hide evidence that would benefit this whole organization? Most of the people here at NASA wish that there was an early civilization on Mars. If we did find life on Mars we would share it world wide, it would be one of the greates scientic breakthroughs in history.

Do you understand what I am saying? The Face on Mars was just a Natural land form, not a monument built by aliens.",1,4,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"The electoral college is a very important this to keep when desiding the presidend. Our founding father established this process in the constitution. The presiden has to have trans-regional appeal he cant just have a lot of states on his side. it is true that public voters dont directly vote for the president and sometimes the electores may not vote for the right person.

The process of the electoral college is writen in the constitution by our founding fathers. Its a compromise between congreses votes and the peoples votes. To win the electoral votes you have to have 270 votes witch is the majority of the votes. Every candidates has his or hers own group of electors that are choosen by the political party.

The presidental candidate has to have trans-reginal appeal because a candidate with reginal appeal is unlikely to win. If a candidate were to campaign heavily in one region he or she will gain no electoral votes. so the candidates have to go croos contry and not stick to one region to actuly gain anything. A candidate can make every person in one reginon vote for him. But the candidate that go cross contry have a better chanse of wining because they have more electoral votes.

Yes a puplic vote does not go direcly to helping a person win but it does help. if there were no elctoral colled a candidat could go to all the hevily populated stae and get all those votes and be puy in to office like that. Just because you are voteing for a slate of electoros doesint mean you are not voting. The publics votes go twored helping choose the electors that vote for the president.

The electoral college is a good thing to have when voting for the president. Its a compromise between congress and the citizens thta was set by the founding fathers. It makes it so that a candidate cant just win over one part of the contery and win; he or she has to win over the majorety of the people.

"Dear State Senator,

The purpose of me writing to you is because, i agree that we should change the way we vote for our president. Everyone has a right to vote but dont you think a easy prosses would be much bette? there are many reasons i disagree with using Electoral Collage but there are way to many reasons so im only going to give a three. my three reasons on why we should not you eletoral college is because the prosses, the problems, and finally because its old.

The electoral collage lets be honest is a huge big unfair process. There are very many steps to the Electoral collage and i belive there are many more ways we can vote. Picking the hardest one in my personal opion is just not to bright. We should have a easy way to help the people running the electoal collage and also help the citizens. There are many resons why doing this wil;l halp the process so we will have our president voted faster.

The eletoral collage has very many problems in its system. a few of them are that when the citizens vote they are not voting for the president they are voting for the elcetors who vote for the presidents. Another reason is Eletoral collage is very unfair. The peeople or the electors that are voting are not always the right ones also depending on which side you are on rpublican or the decmocratic sometimes een for example you are a republican one of your electors could be democratic as i said before very unfair.

Finally everyone gets tired of crummy old boring things! Have you ever hear it is good to try new things? lets face it the system is really old. I believe would shold try differant methods of selecting the president. If for any reason it does not work out we can always try something else or go back too the same way. i belive that we should try something new and not the same old boring unfair way we have been using for years.

All in all i belive  that we should change the way we vote for the president. This eletoral collage from my understaning is not something we should keep using. As i said there are to many reason that i would have to write down but here are my three reasons to change the way we vote. First the prosses of picking the president, second the problems that the eletoral college has, and last because the system is old and needs to change so, no that you have read this are you going to help me and everyone else change this system?

"There was one cloudy morning in a Monday afternoon. The day was a busy day. It came to Tamala's (one of Professer's scientists) attention about the ""The Face on Mars"". She showed the scientist, Professer Lryc while she was observing a sick frog, new high-resoultion images and 3D altmetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa.

""What is this that you are showing me?"", said Professer Lyrc

""Well, said Tamala. This is Viking photos from a Mars Global surveyor from 1976, 1998, 2001.""

Professer looks puzzled. It came to her attention that she learned about this from college. She remembers that she did a project on this long time ago.

""Very interesting, said Professer. I think we should have a discussion about this.""

""You think."", said Tamela

""Yes, because this is very interesting.""

So, Tamela called everyone to come to the court room to discuss the interesting news.

"" Ms.Tamela, I was really trying to get my project over with."", said Niguel

"" No time for that right now Niguel, said Professer. We have some business to discuss. Now Ms. Tamela has some business to tell you. And it is very interesting.""

""So, you know I was looking all over the internet about Mars, said Tamela. And I have found this."" Tamela struggles to turn the projector on. After a couple of seconds it show the photos. The visitors were looking surprised and confused.

""That looks familar."" said Niguel.

""Very familar. Is it the...the...um?', Sam hesatated.

""Face on Mars?"", said Dave.

""Yes, it is. Thanks Dave. said Tamela. So I've called everyone here because...I believe this is real."" Everyone gasp.

"" How can you prove that, Ms. Tamela."", said Professer.

""Well, Professer, Tamela explains. Twenty-five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's VIking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called...Cydonia.""

""Wow, so that's what you researched."", said Professer.

"" Basically, Tamela said. The ""Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazine, radio shows, even haunted grocery checkout lines for 25 years!""

""Oh really."", said Professer.

""Some people think the Face is ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rater hide."", said Tamela.

Professer looks surprised. "" Any final words. Because I have a class in four minutes."", said Professer.

""Oh, what the picture acutally shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around th American West. That's what I've learned.""

Another thing that is interesting is that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and in size also in distance. Also no spacecraft has survied to land for more than a couple of hours in more than three decades. One of the few things that make Venus a dangerous planet is that it's the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system as said in paragraph 3.

This quote shows that when a person is confused on what the other person is feeling , this machine will help someone know exactly how the other peron is feeling.

Second, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Alto writes,"" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate"". This quote shows that this machine is not only detecting facial emotions but it is a great way for humans to comunicate with computers.

Thirdly, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for Modifying the lessons based on how students are feeling. Alto writes,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson"" . This quote shows that the computer could pick up if one of sudents is getting confused , bored ,etc. and it could modify the lesson so that the student will not be confused or bored anymore.

The Facial Action Coding system is valuable to have in a classroom , Although many say its not, These three reasons is why having the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a class room. In the world today many people struggle knowing what someone is feeling so they know wheather to help them or not so this machine could really help someone in the future. "" whoever thought that makeing faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions"".",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"The big debate is wether we should use automated cars that are operated without a use of a driver controling it. I believe that this may be the way to create driving easier and safer for everyone. Driverless cars are going to be a great thing if the big companies like Google and General Motors keep developing this concept of a car drving on its own.

The whole idea of having a car drive on its own just seems like a dream. Well in today's world we already have driverless cars in use in states like California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. I believe that this is a big long term plan. It isn't just going to change in a year or two, this process in going to take time to develop. In today's world there are car wrecks that happen every single day, but what if we could stop the amount of wrecks with automated cars that sense danger and bring down the percent of wrecks a day. If we would be able to do this, it would make it safer to be on the roads and the streets not having to worry about other cars crashing into you.

Now there are a lot of people that are highly against this idea. They believe that it will take to long. That we should trust our instincts while driving. Another thing is this process would have to be allowed by the law and government. I have to argue that this going to take a long time to covert everything for automated cars, and yes it will be expensive for the starting years. Think about it long term, everyday we use up natural rescources of our planet. Scienctists say that there are only so many natural resources and that we need to start conserving these resources. Cars fill up for gas everyday and use up these resources. Google's Cofounder Sergey Brin envisions that these automated cars will use half the fuel of regular cars today. That is a big difference and it will save us in the long run.These car can keep a safer environment for people. The human's can't rely on one another while driving. Too many people die every year in car crashes because someone was drinking too much or had some impairment while driving. Just think, the automated cars can't get drunk and swerve into another car.

When this discussion comes up later in life remember this. These cars can hold the key for more resources in the future, and make it safe to be on the roads again. Be on the side of this argument that can make a difference in today's world and society.",3,3,2,3,1,2,1,3,2
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is speculated to have been the most similar to Earth, studying it can be done at reasonable expectations, and combatting the difficulty of studying Venus will have great benefits to our knowledge on the planet itself and space exploration.

It has long been a conspiracy yet to be proven as to if Venus is one of our known sister planets that are the most similar to Earth today. Space explorers long ago predicted that Venus was likely covered with large oceans and had the potential to possibly support multiple forms of life. Without an indepth study of Venus at a close and personal view, nothing can be predetermed factually. In paragraph four the author explains that ""it [Venus] may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that the possibility is there but without extra measures taken to pursue an indepth study, the question remains unanswered as to if Venus is a sister planet of Earth.

While an upclose, indepth view of Venus is not predictable due to the harsh environment, NASA has found potential ways to make exploration dueable to an extent. In paragraph five, the author states that: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This helps widen the idea that exploration of Venus can be done and met at a reasonable expectation and limit safe for explorers. The author proceeds to state that while the conditions are not particularly easy they are ""survivable for humans."" This helps detail and push for the idea of the exploration of Venus because it is and has been discovered that the study can be done safely.

The overall study of Venus can prove to be extremely beneficial to our knowledge on the planet alone, and our knowledge on space exploration at most. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value."" In which it does, combatting the challenge of Venus proves to be tough, but if done, it can mean more to the exploration of other planets that are tougher than Venus alone. Further in paragraph eight, it is said that ""travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Once we begin to limit our exploration and discoveries due to the dangers and doubts, we take away from our progression of knowing what is out of our way. With the study of Venus we can extend our doings to meet every innovation and curiosity about our solar system all together.

Studying Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. With the study of Venus we can determine if Venus is a sister planet of our planet today, and if the planet was once inhabitable for organisms and humans. Studying Venus is also worth the pursuit because the study can be done, and if the study is done, it will benefit us far more than the study of any other planet has yet to. The study of Venus will bring our knowledge and our future immense benefits in all aspects.",5,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"My position on driverless cars is that they should be used when needed not all the time. They are not as safe as people think they are for the fact that they cannot think for themselves. They will have to have way to many sencersto be able to try to keep every one safe. Safty is a big concern because of all the sencers that are there and one of them go out the othere sencers cant see that spot so if something were in that spot then they would have died.

Some people think smart cars are going to be the next big thing but i dont hink so safty and money are way out of the safty range at the moment and i dont think it is a very good idea because where are you going to get all the money to buy a smart car, I know i would not have enough money for that because i dont have money for a regular car at the moment because wll i just got my job. Just take a minute and think would you want your child playing on the street and this driverless car comes through that same street and the sencer on that part of the car is not working and it does't see your child and runs he\she over?

So in conclusion, Smart cars are not as smart as they seem. They will not be cheep cars to have and if they get themselfs into an accident think of all the money that you would have to

put into it to fix all of the damage that it would have caused itsself. Think about the insurence bill if it accidentaly kills someone because one of the sencers were out. I think that they would bee good to have if you are sick but not any other time i think it would be stupid to even try to have them but that is my opionion on the matter i just wouldn't buy one because i do not wat to be responsible for something tragic happening to anythingor anyone.",1,2,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"greenhouse gasses have always been a problem that riddled america and also politics, but many other countrys are limiting their usage of cars. paris even made there be specific days where people will keep their cars at home or be fined. paris is among the most densley polluted citys on earth, and they thought it might be good for everybody to take a break from polluting the city and maybe breath easy for a few days. almost 4,000 drivers were fined a total of 31 dollars (US) and 27 people had their cars impounded because they were upset about the fines. Its nice to see a country actually care about what it is doing to the enviroment, but it might take something big for other countrys to follow suit.

the small city in columbia bogota also took part in reducing the emmissions in the air. bogta encouraged the public to stay inside and anyone violating this rule was fine 25 dollars, many people would take out their bicycles and ride those around opposed to driving and polluting the air. the campaign in bogota bagan in the mid 1990s and has constructed 118 miles of bike paths ever since. other countrys should follow what bogota is trying to do, because if we dont pollute the earth too much then we can live her longer.

president obamas ambitious goals to curb the united states greenhouse emmissions, unveiled last week ,will geta fortuitous assist from an incipent shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that america is buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer liscenses as years go by. that has left researchers pondering a fundamental question:has america passed peak driving? the united states with its broad expanses and suburban ideals, had been one of the worlds prime car cultures. it is the birth place of the model T; the home of detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""mustang sally"" just kidding im not gonna copy all of that. but really america has cut down on the use of cars and we should be proud.

"Imagen just looking at your computer and your computer telling your emotions. Do you think that is a good think? I believe that it is i good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring to you, help you understand what you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

One reason why it is a good idea because it can help you learn something that is boring for you. The computer can help find a video or something that can help the work be for fun or extced for you. For example, say that I do not like math or i can not figure out what the answer is because i am bored the computer can find a video to help me.

Another reason, is it can help you learn something you do not know. For example say the teacher does not explain a problem correctly and so the computer looks up a video or something that can explain the problem.

Last reason, is the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.

For example the computer will look at your face and will see that you can not do a problem and sees your frustration and the computer will look uo an article,video,etc.. that will help you and it will give you instuctions on how to do something.

In conclusion, as you can see the technology to read the emotinal expressions of student's is a great idea because it can help you something that boring to you, help you understand something that you do not know, and the computer can give you instructions on how to do your work.",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"I am against the driverless cars,beacuse most of our people will be without a job if they enforce these cars.The people that drives the buses where would they work how are they going to make a living for themselves and their family.What about the people that drives the taxis that we now have,if they enforce these cars what will thses people do to make a living.How would children get back and forth to school everyday.We have school buses that we dont have to pay for.

Technology is not always reliable,for instance what if the driverless car goes out or messes up then there will be an accident and someone will be injured maybe even death.Accidents happens now and we have people driving cars but like i said technology is not always reliable.they even said it in paragraph 9""If the technology fails and someone is enjured,who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer(the creater or maker of this car).Who will they blame if this car creates a problem such as an accident.I think that they will blame the driver of the car becuse they were behind the wheel.

They are probably going to say that the driver should have been paying attetion.To me an driverless car means the driver dosent has to anything but fill the tank up with gas if the car contains gas.They say the car notifys you when its needs human assistence,but what if it doesnt say anything then that will be an accident.The BMW is good enough there really hasnt been any accidents

"Why should we limit our uses on car usages, some people se the limiting of car usage as less tense. "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said heidrun Walter, a mother of two. when you have a car you'll have to find space for it as well as a house to buy. There are only two places to park at the edge of a development, where a car-owner has to pay $40,000, along with a home. passenger cars are responcible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in the United states. with less cars people have the advantages of being a walk away from a store instead of a highway. With less cars that give off gas emissions the less our ozone will deplete. More and more people are using hybrid cars because they dont give off as much gas emissions than regular cars that take diesel. Depending on the weather of the night and day could really effect the greenhouse effect of our planet. If ther was a cold night and a warm day this could help the warmer layer of air to trap the car emissions, which depletes the ozone layer that is protecting our planet.

Paris one of the most leading countries in the world with the car emissions ended making people stop using their cars because of all the smog that was  being created. People who used their cars were fined $31 and if they complained about that their car would somethimes be towed away. While the rule of no cars was in effect the traffic jams in france were down over 60 percent. Think about what this could do to the United States. The smog had cleard so much that Paris eventually allowed odd numbered plates to drive again on Tuesday. "" 'It's a good oppourtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution'  said Carlos Arturo as he rode with his wife on a two seat bicycle"" ( Andrew Selsky, Source 3). The no car rule is sweeping over the nations, because of this rule there has been over 118 miles of bicycle paths in Bogota, Colombia.

"" Municipal athorities from other countries came to Bogota to see the event and were enthusiastic 'These poeple are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders' Said Enrique Riera, the mayor of asuncion, Paraguay. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly down by 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January of 1995. Part of the explantion lies in the recession, because cash- strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unimployed weren't going to  work anyway. These people could not afford cars but they could have afforded a bike if they wanted to. They could have rode to work on a bike or could have tried to find a job on a bike it's that people are starting to get to lazy to do important things like ride a bike. With cars theres gas you have to pay for along with the insurence, that's a lot of money.

Lucky for us Americas love affair twords vehicles seem to be coling down. When the number of child growth grew, the number of miles driven dropped steadly down in 2005. With cars the rodes are more dangerous anything could happen to anyone or anything. The percentage of 16-39 year olds that are driving dropped, while older people retain thweir licenses as they age. A study last year was found tha driving by younger people dropped by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

"Technology able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because we could detect different type of moods even by making faces that wouldn't necessarily indicate a certain mood just by looking at their face. This sort of technology can benefit in more way's as well such as helping video game designers make their graphics more realistic and having characters resemble actual and more expressive moods.

Reading students emotional expressions can determine how they could possibly feel and perhaps help them out if they're feeling low or having a bad day. A simple computer program could tell if a student is in need of help by determining if the student is in a state of confusion or stress. Then if the student is confused or in need of help then the lesson could be modified and altered to be made more understandable for the student. The student could also be helped by a digital instructor that would trigger when the student is confused. Technology like this could give students better understanding of whatever is being taught knowing there are students that are too shy or scared to ask questions it could finally help them learn without having any fear of raising their hand and causing attention.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can really benefit students all around the world who would use it and prepare and give students more understanding in our future causing it to be brighter and more vivid ,therefore, the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable piece of technological advancment that could impact our future in a positive manner.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear, state senator

I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

Because it's easier to read when voting, everything is label right, and the President has alot of trust in people.

First of all, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because it's easier to read when voting. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President"". This shows that when all the votes are tallyed up theirs no need to go through so much problem, when their's basically a rubric to go over the electors and the electoral votes. For example, if this wasn't invented, we would have our own people just sit their on long day and nights. Without any sleep and count all those votes. This could lead to alot of miscounts. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the presidnet of the United States.

Furthermore, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because everything is label right. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register, it states that ""Under the 23rd Amendement of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors. . . ."". This shows that whatever the 23rd Amendment is under, that's what the District of Columbia is allocated. This is just like an case at court or when you getting arrested. For example, when you are pleged guilty for murder. The judge is going to read every amendment you broke and what's your charges. And everything that's she's reading is made up. It's all labeled in United State Constitution. This is why i strongly believe we should keep the Electroal College for the president of the United States.

Lastly, I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the

United States because the president has alot of people to trust in. In source one, by the Office of the Federal Register it states that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors."" This shows that whoever the president of the United State is choosing for his or her own group of electors has put alot of trust on each and one of that individual. And it's time for the President to see who or who he can't put his trust in. For example, A president has alot of things that we depend on him or her to do for our Country. And the Electoral College is the best way to see if he or she could do it. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.

In conclusion, I strongly believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States because; One, it's easier to read when voting. If the Electoral College didn't existed their would be alot of miscounting. Second, everything is label right. Their's no need to get things from the top of your head. Third, the presdient has aot of in trust in people. Us humans gets to finally see if we could depend on him. If he choose's the right group of electors. This is why I believe we should keep the Electoral College for the president of the United States.0",1,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Around twenty-five years ago something obscure was found. NASA's Viking 1 was circling Mars and taking photos, little did they know that the would discover the Face.

The Face is indeed a natural landform. The Face is a rock formation with the characteristics of a human face, on the red planet Mars. The article states that the face is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.

NASA has been trying to prove the face is indeed a real life occurance. They have worked real hard to get pictures. Mars Global Surveyor is mapping a spacecraft that looks straight down to scan the panet in a narrow 2.5 km-wide strip. They often do not passover the face but when they do they make the most out of it.

Many people have gone crazy for the Face. The Face has appeared in Hollywood movies, novels, magazine articles, radio alk shows, and even grocery stores during halloween. I guess you can say the Face has become the Face for Mars.

Scientist has proven tha the Face is real. The Face represents wha has been or whose to come onto Mars. It has been twenty-five years since the discovery of the Face. Let's hope there is more to come.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.",5,4,2,3,1,2,2,3,2

"Dear Mr. Senator,

The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electors vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another cadidate. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way"". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College.

Aside from causing issues in the United States, the Electoral College is extremely unfair to voters. The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. '

To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!""",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Many people have been asking themselves the same question, ""Should the electoral college stay or go?"". Having the electoral college is not a fair way of choosing for presidency. People want to vote for a president, not a slate of electors to have them vote for the president. Some people worry about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. Changing the way we Americans vote is a fair way for citizens to see that their vote truelly does count.

The electoral college is unfair to voters. Accoriding to

Source 2 , ""Having the winner-take-all system in each state, canidadtes don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winnning, focus only in the ""swing"" states."" Seventeen states didn't see the canidadtes at all during the 2000 campaign and some of the largest media companies didn't get to see ads for the campaign. That was a way for people to change their mind if maybe the canidadte did visit their state. Citizens in their state shouldn't be voting for someone else to go vote for president. People are into the idea of choosing the right leader for our country, so having the popular vote shows what people think on the canidadtes.

People do worry about the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If this does happen we know that the House of Representatives will take charge, where state delegations vote on the president. Since having the electoral college, each state shows only one vote, so for example, 500,000 voters represent a state and then having 55 representatives from another state, who then represents 35 million voters is not a fair of choosing a president. And the House's selection can hardly be expected to represent the will of the people. Bradford Plumer states in

So maybe changing to popular vote instead of having electoral college is a good and easier thing.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Mars has many landforms, but there is a particular one that is peculiar. The landfrom is known as The Face. The Face was spotted by a space surveyor in 1976 and has been a mystery to the world ever since. Some people say that this landform was made by alien life on Mars, but with facts from NASA and other sources you could see that those people are wrong.

The Face has had many theories made up about how it was made and if it is even real. One of these theories is about how or who created it. This theory is about how NASA is hiding the fact that the face was made by some type of alien lifeform, which logically makes no sense at all. Finding life on another planet would bring in a gargantuan amount of money for NASA so it would seem completely illminded to hide something like this from the people. NASA can only wish they knew about an alien lifeform.

With this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof on how it was made. Throughout the knowing of this landform three pictures were taken of it. The first of pictures was in 1976 when they first found it and camera quality was not very good. With not a clear image, and the need for answers, NASA sought out for another picture and got one during a cloudy winter day in 1988. This picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people to be one-hundred percent sure how it was made. So the wait began to get another picture. Finally in two-thousand-one NASA used a new, high-resolution, three-dimensional camera to take an outstanding clear photo of what they concluded to be a mesa, common in the American West, just with the physical pheatures of a human face.

In conclusion this outstanding land form on Mars had the world stuck asking this question, ""Is there alien life on mars?"" The Face was a mystery to science for almost thirty years only to be proven to be just another landform on Mars. To conclude, this landform is nothing more than a naturally occuring lava dome.",2,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I think that that the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of people is valuable. I think this because sometimes its important to know someones emotion, and if they are faking or lying. This technolgy could be helpful for people to indicate wheather they need help or not. I also think that tis technology could help save lives too. I'll explain why.

First reason on why this technology is valuble is because it can be used in the classroom to know wheather a student is confused on the lesson or not. A shy student sometimes wouldnt want to ask for help about the lesson. So using this technology for would be very useful because teachers would now know who and who needs help. It could also help teacher to know if a student is angry, sad, etc to know how to help them. That one reason why I think this techonolgy is useful.

Another reason why emotion reading technology is useful because in paragraph 8 the article stated "" to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isnt being truthful"". This means now we could know if a leader is being real or not. It could help with votes during an election to choose the correct politician. Not only that but in genral to knoe if people are lying or not.

last reason why I think the use of this technology is valuable is because it can save peoples lives. using this technolgy would let you know how a person is feeling. If a person is depressed and on the edge of doing something that they shouldnt , using this emtion reading technology could alert people on how others can be feeling very down and thode people could help them. It could also help parents knowing wheather their child is happy or not and I think a parent should know their childrens emotion because half the time we dont express our selves to our parents. So thats why I think using technology that can indicate your emtion is valuable.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"I think that having driverless cars would be a good idea because many people text and drive. Even though its against the law people are still going to do it but with driverless cars you could text if you want and it wouldnt matter because you wouldnt be the one driving. This also goes for drinking and driving, thats another big issue around the world. People like to drink and then leave in there cars which causes many wrecks and harms many people, but with driverless cars it wouldnt matter if you were drunk because, again, you wouldnt be the one driving. I think that having driverless cars would also be kind of weird. More like different. Having to drive your car is all people have ever known. It would be knew to everyone but im sure it wouldnt be difficult at all but i dont know. I hope that one day in my life time driverless cars are created. I think that it would be a cool sight to see and an experience for everyone. I think that they should invent the driverless car and let people try them out and see if it would a good idea to make them more popular and let more and more people start driving them. If driverless cars do become a new thing, im sure it will take quite sometime for them to be completely ready to be drivin around and used daily. Thats if it even happens which I hope it does because I think it would be cool.",1,3,0,2,0,0,0,1,1
"A new software has been developed that improves accuaracy in perceiving the emotions of others. This new software has promsing applications for a variety of industries. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it can make learning more interesting, it's accurate, and to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

Using the Facial Action Coding System in a learning environment could help make education more interesting. To make learning more interesting, a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. The same technology can make computer -animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Dr.Huang states,""Most human communicaton is nonverbal,including emotial communication so computers need to understand that,too.""

This means that computers would need to know nonverbal communication.

Along with making learning more interesting, the Facial Action Coding System is really accurate. The FACS begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr.Paul Eckman classified six basic emotions and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Dr.Huang even observes artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely

enough to convey specific emotions.

In addition of the FACS being accurate, it develops new ways for humans and computers to communicate. The FACS developed new ways to communicate in various ways. It tracks facial movements by weighing the different units. The software can identify mixed emotions. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology is valuable because it can make learning more interesting, it's accurate, and it develops better ways for humans and computers to communicate.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,1,2
"The author says that studies Venus would be beneficial to the world. He says this because Venus is sometimes the closest planet to us and would give us insight to other planets outside our solar system. We could learn about how water works on planets and if Venus ever hosted life. If Venus did at one point have life on its surface that would be the greatest discovery ever made. Next is how we would explore Venus.

If we were to explore Venus NASA would allow scientists to float above the roiling Venusian landscape by having you in a blimp like vehicle above 30 miles. We already know the Venus has had oceans in the past. We know this because of the valleys, mountain, and craters. The valleys are by the oceans Venus had. The mountains are caused by the movement of tectonic plates, and the craters are caused by space debris and asteroids hitting Venus. Furthermore is the life that could have been on Venus in it's oceans.

Now if there was life on Venus that would be the biggest discovery of mankind. There was definatly a possibility of life on Venus in the oceans. Basic life was found on Earth as far back as almost 3 billion years ago, that would have been a good time for Venus to support life on its surface as well. The surface of Venus is so inhospitable now that spacecrafts sent to study Venus haven't survived for more than a few hours. That's because of the atmosphere of Venus which ia almost 97 percent carbon dioxcide. The pressure of Venus is higher than the pressure in the deepest parts of our oceans.

In conclusion, Venus is a really good place to research despite the dangers. We could find life outside Earth for the first time on Venus. NASA has offered a way for scientists to research Venus by putting them into a blimp like vehicle that would be hovering at around 30 miles high. THe only danger is the pressure but in that vehicle NASA would provide it would be like a submarine in our oceans. That is why and how the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2
"The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He has classified six basic emotions - happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness each characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raise your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris(around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion). ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor."" The same technology can make computer -animatedfaces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. I belive it can read your emotional expressions better than a average human can because it can scan your face and see what your emotion is even if you pretend to be happy and your not. I think its a great creation soon everyone will use it and believe to.",0,1,3,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I think the Facial Action Coding System technology that allows computers to read emotions could be valuable to students in a classroom.

One of the ways this technology could be valuable is because it would help students who are confused or bored, like Dr. Huang predicts,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" That would be valuable because students are sometimes afraid to ask for help so the computer could either inform the teacher or provide extra information to the student that needs it.

Another way that technology in a classroom could be valueable to students is because it could give teachers feedback on how their students are liking the assignment. If the students become bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicted, ""Then it could modify the assignment, like an effective human instructor."" So that would give the teacher feedback of how their students are liking the assignment. Then they could modify the assignment to be more enjoyable or less confusing for the students if needed.

The Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions could be valuable to a classroom for many reasons. It could help students that are confused on an assignment by reading the student's face to see if they are confused. It could also give teachers feedback on how their students are enjoying the assignment. If the students aren't enjoying the assigment or are confused the computers could inform the teacher. The teacher then could modify the assignment to make it less confusing and more enjoyable for the students. Those are some of the reasons why that type of technology could be valuable to students in a classroom.",2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1
"I want you! as one of my seagoing cowboy's, Why? because It's a good cause for other people of course but that's not the only thing you can do being a seagoing cowboy.

If you join the seagoing cowboys then not only are you helping people but your also gonna have fun in the procces, Like sightseeing. When you join the seagoing cowboys you get to travel to all kinds of places like china, italy, ireland, everywhere that's been damaged or low on resources you get to go there.

Secondly after you join and finish your first mission on the way back you get to have a fantastic time in the animal stalls (you also get to transport animals but thats next paragraph) just hanging around playing fencing, table tennis, basketball, volleyball, boxing, reading, and whittling but that's all they we could think of down in the stalls. But I bet if you joined maybe you could think of a way to spice things up down in the stall's don't you think.

Finally If you join our seariding cowboys then you also get to take care of all the animals that were transporting for other countries that lost practically everything to ruthless attacks in world war II and the pacific war. It's also a benefit to you guys who loves all animals, hey you can even say they love it when you play and mooooove around with them.

But what I'm saying is that joining the seagoing cowboy isnt that bad but the exact opposit infact I went to many places and still find everything around me interesting and new like the adventure will never stop.

"Fellow citizens should know the advantages of limiting their car usage of drivng less car can reduce the pollution, For example the article ""In German Suburb,Life Goes on Wihtout cars"" it says ""expert says its a huge impedmient to currenty efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpopes. Cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission"". Thats why its important to cut back, If not... They could ban driving. For Example the article ""Paris Bans driving due to smog"" Paris almost of near the record pollution, so paris enfored partial drivng ban to clear the air of the global city. And there was 1 article about ""Car Free Day Is Spinnning into a big hit in Bogota"" talks about banning cars and only transportation is bike, walk, and busses.

In the article ""German Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars"" people who ownes house has to pay for Parking space stated ""Car ownersship is allowed but they must buy a parking spaces which can cost up to $40,000"" cause of this people who dont have money rather buy a house instead of a car so they dont have to pay $40,000 for a parking space. 70% of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57% sold a car to move to germany.

""Paris bans driving due to smog"" Paris bans driving becuase after days of near record pollution, Which made Prais enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mortorists with even numbered license plates were order to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine which is $31 in USD. And some drivers dont even enfored the rule for example ""4,000 drivers were fined for not coperating with the rule enforced by paris offical. Diesel fuel was the blmamed since France Car which is made up of 67% of cars fueled with diesels. its a good idea for Paris to ban driving for certain amount of days because it can clear the air up with pollutions.

In ""Car free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" they have banned driving for 3 straight years. the only transportation you could get around is buses and taxis is permmited for the day without cars in the capital city of population of 7 million. People who violate the banned of driving could faced a $25 fines, the turn out was large, despite gray clouds thay dumped rains showers on Bogota. As the mayor says ""its a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" in this case i agree with the mayor because having a stree-free pollution can lead to a heathier state and a clean enviroment.

""The End of Car Culture"" President Obama ambitous goals to curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions. Many sociologists believe it will have benefical implications for carbon emissions and the enviroments, since transporation is the 2nd largest source of american's emission. For example companys like ""Ford and Mercedes have been rebranding themselves as a mobility companines. with all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habits. Company who offer transportation for example in New York theres a new bike sharing program to reduce car transportation.

So as a fellow citizens its a good idea to cut back and save on money, and pollution to our planet earth. everyone wants a clean and safe enviroment. One thing you dont want is your country to ban or limited driving which makes you take the city bus or call a taxi.",2,1,3,2,0,0,1,0,0
"Have you ever wondered what will happen to earth once it becomes over populated? Well one soultion might be going to Venus. The reason why we could go to Venus is because its like earth and in the article in paragraph 2 it says ""often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". Now it is hot on Venus yes as the average temperatures are over 800 degrees and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth, we could still use venus as a back up planet for when our own planet gets overpopulated and we run out of room. Or we could also discover some new life who knows but we would still need a way to grow crops there and raise live stock if we wanted to survive or even grow crops on Earth and fly them over to the people who lives on Venus.

Now some people could wonder if we cant even get spacecraft on the planet how are we gonna know if there is anywhere to live or if anything already lives there. Well if we send a human there floating 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape they would be above the storms and the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. But it would still be hot there so we could maybe give that person a special aircraft or suit that would not get so hot on the inside.

We should try to explore Venus because you never know what could be there But also that could be a backup planet for when our Earth gets over populated or maybe even something worse but i guess we will just have to wait and see what NASA does. Hopefully they find out a way to explore Venus in a safe way because at the end of the day we all just want to be safe and never stop exploring.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Technology has been vastly improving these past couple of years. With all these new technological improvements it can also play a major factor in classrooms. All teenagers these days are very ""tech-friendly"". Therefore it would only make sense that we should incorporate some of these technological adavances

into the classroom so students could be more engaged during class. It would greatly improve many homework scores, quiz scores, and even test scores

thus overall having many improvements to their grades in all.

The new software "" Facial Action Coding System"" has been a huge technological improvement to this time.

In the passage it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements---in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotion."" This can show how in a classroom if students are being active during a lesson and participating. Or if they are dozing off somewhere else with the help of this technology then the computer can change its algorithms to change how the lesson is being taught therefore making the student pay attention during class.

In a classroom filled with some kids that just can't focus and/or do not understand then this technology can come into great use. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" the passage states. This technology could help students that have trouble with some classes or just are not paying attention whatsoever, in the passages it also states,

""Then it can modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" With this technology it can highly improve on keeping the students attention at all times, this can help the students with making sure they know whats going on during class at all times instead of zoning out then missing something very cruical and overall messing alot of things up but instead keeping them highly engaged at all times.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is greatly valuable. The use of this technological advancement would greatly improve students comprehension of some classes in school that they might've not understood before. It would be more personalized to that specific person, the more confused you look the more different ways it would look to make sure you understand the concept. Thus making the student very proactive and improving their overall grade.",2,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,1
"is it right whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable. The software is the latest innovation from prof.

"Dear Senator:

Many people say that electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. Even though I agree with this position in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Despite the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; I belive that retaining the Electoral College is what is best for non-liberal or conservative reasons.

The Elecotoral College avoids the problem of electons in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For instance, one of my sources told me"" In 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College.

The Elecotoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution. For example, another source"" In 2012, the popular vote was very close in Florida; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" Large states gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does.

"I say that making driverless cars would be great you would be able to talk in a car more efficiently, watch your kids, play games do all the things you've ever wanted to do in a car, done! Technically the technology has been out since the 1950s so why not let's move towards the new age!

Google seems like the company leading in this technology so far. In 2009 their cars could already handle everything but pull in and out of driveways and navigate through roadwork or accidents. Originally many thought that self-driving cars would begin with smarter roads. Back in the 1950s General Motors (GM) made a concept car that drove on a track embedded with electrical cable that sent radio signals to a receiver on the front end of the car. Engineers at Berkeley thought magnets would be the answer, using alternating polarity. The car read the positive and negative polarity as messages in binary code. Both of these systems worked well (and I know you're thinking ""then what was the problem) but they were way to expensive.

Now back to Google. Google has recently produced a modified Toyota Prius equipped with lots of sensors. One on the rear left wheel,one that rotates on the roof, an inertial motion sensor and four automotive radar sensors but the most important sensor is the one the spinning one on the roof named LIDAR. LIDAR uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of its surroundi",1,3,3,2,1,2,2,1,1
"After reading this article, I have grown a nutreal side of this topic. The reason why is becuase I found a liking for the discovery, but there is also some things that I dislike as well. This tech can become useless and useful in many situations.

One reason why this is a good piece of technology is for court cases or things such as that. People could check if a persons emotions are set of fear, anger, sadness, and other emotions as well. If this technology becomes advaced we could see if a person is lieing just by their facial actions. This could help court cases become justified and more crimes solved.

A reason why this is bad is due to people and their privacy. I would like it to be scanned just to see my emotions, many people would agree with me on this as well. People who could get their hands on this could use it too much or go over the top with this tech. Also, since there is people who probobly don't like this type of technology, they would throw a fit it they would have to use it.

Also another reason why this is bad is the portablity of this technology. For this to work they would need a high end computer to check someone, and not everyone can just wheel in a computer like that and check someones emotions out of the labatory. This technology is usless without a lab becuase you need a lot of tech to do this expierment on someone.

Another reason why I partly side with this technology is for old painting, such as this article explains. The artcile talks about finding the emotions of one of the most world wide known paintings in the world, the Mona Lisa. We could find out people emotions from years ago, dating back from the first detailed paintings. This could also work on not just paintings, but old photos. Imagine seeing what emotions people had in pictures from World War 1 or other wars. Seeing this could bring a new sight into history.

One of my most favorite reasons why we need this is for classrooms. Many people get bored in school, so this computing could help out. The article claims that it could tell if a student is bored or confused, and could change the way the lesson is in seconds. This could help kids out with learing and could future their education. But with that computers would have to understand if a student is making a face to confuse the computer into thinking the kid is confused or not, because we all know that one student that would play with the computer to mess up peoples education for the day.

Another bad reason for this is becuase people could fake their emotions. Many people know how to act on stage, so they could easily do that to a computer to fake their emotions. This could trick computers to doing things that it really shouldn't. This means that this technology could become tricked, making it usless in many situations.

A good reason for this is for advertising. The article states that ads can be modifyed to show things that make you happy and could make you purchase it. If you see a ad you don't like you won't get ads like those anymore, insted it will supply ones that will possibly make you happy, if you still don't like those ads, the process will repeat will you do find a interesting ad. This could lead to higher sales, but also lower sales.

Lastly, my final reason is how hard it will be to access this tech. It states in the article that a home PC will not be able to handle to algorithims to understand facial emotions. Many people will not be able to expirement with this nor use it at all. So this technology will not be know to the public unlike other technology.

All in all, this technology will recive mixed opinions, manly due to the fact that people will not be able to get their hands on it unlike phones, laptops, PC's, and consoles. This item can be very useful, but needs to be polished to be absolutely useful in every situation. This technology will grow as long as they work hard enough to make this tech one-hundered percent useful in this world.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"As a scientist I had to discusss the overall topic about extraterrestrials and the creation of the face on Mars giving the mosts reasonable and lucid -something clearly shown- ideas. There is many reasons why this ""face"" was not made by aliens. As a scientist I had to explain some evidence that would show what this ""face"" is classified as. Also I had to show the main ideaology on these speculations or conspiracies that ""know"" what NASA is doing. My main job as scientist is to observe, study, and explain many mysteries but I had to use clearly expressed qualifications for the face to be created by aliens.

For my first reasoning on this topic I had to discuss this person how this landform is classified as mesa or butte which occurs normally in many environments. Like Garvin said in paragraph 12 in Unmasking the Face of Mars, ""It reminds me most of Midlle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" showing how this type of landform isn't really rare or unique to find. Could this be something created by aliens, too? Well of course not because a mesa can be locationalized in many parts of the hemisphere of Earth around the globe!

After showing the person what this is exactly, I needed to explain how these landforms are ACTUALLY formed. In paragraph 12 of Unmasking the Face on Mars like Garvin said, that the mesa called Middle Buttle in the Snake River on Earth is actually a lava dome that take the form of an insolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face on Mars. Proving that these mesa landforms are not as unique as anyone could think as vividly as possible and are actually formed naturally on Earth. This is acutally scientifically proven by research done over the years on many mesa landforms in Earth.

Another type of reasoning this ""face"" is not made by aliens is proven by photographs tooked by probes above Mars's atmosphere showing clear images of this landform in which gives another reason that this landform is not even a face. First of all this ""face"" was taken by Voyager 1 on 1976 making this photo not revelant for the accusations made by this person. Best of all, the Voyager 1 had a poor quality camera with 43 meters per pixel making the image pixelated and not advance enough for high definition quality compared to the 2001 image tooken by MGS which had 1.56 meter per pixel giving it better quality and rendering of the landform. Also, the more revelant and sufficient evidence contrast to the unrevelant photo for the idea of the ""face,"" shows that the ""face"" is a normal mesa instead of the physical view of a ""face"" on the surface of Mars's rusted iron soil shown by Voyager 1.

Though my reasonings are supported with evidence and proof, the person may accuse me saying that NASA is hiding alien civilization from the public peers and have the alien technology used for goverment power as said so by many conspiracy theorists. Well I'm not going to lie, defenders of the NASA budget actually WISH there was an ancient civiliztion on Mars. This proves that NASA would show the public, due to the fact that it will help fund NASA with more public support and would make NASA use that money funded for more research and expeditions.

So in conclusion, there are many proven reason why the ""face"" on mars is not made by aliens. Since the mesa landform is not unique and there are plenty here on Earth, since there are also many types of evidence and research done on how these lanforms are made, and since there are also details shown more easily through the revelant photos from MGS showing the ""face"" to be just your average mesa. Also that after all this time, defenders of the NASA budget actually hope for ancient civilization on Mars.",4,3,3,3,1,1,2,3,1
"the autor suggestds that we should explore venus, personally i think it not a good idea but the author really does not support it and gives great examples to why we shouldt go out a study this beautifle planet called venus. on paragraph 3 the author really gives us great exam-les of the problems of exploring this planet one great exaple that i think will convince people from not going is that the authomosphere of venus is really thick and it is 97 percent carbon dioxcide which is bad for us , and also the temprature on average is 800 degrees which is pretty hot. As i saw read this part i noticed that the author isnt really against studiyng this planet he supports it.

On paragrapgh 4 he tells us that venus is simaller to earth becasue they have terrains just like ours, valleys,mountains ,and craters. The author also shares with us and writes that Nasa's possible solution to exploring or studying this amazing planet without having to touch the surface is float above the fray use an aircraft that is like blimp. This will only help them see the surface but they wont be able to collect rocks or soil which will be harder for them. One way Nasa is already working to be able to collect rocks is by using the computer used during World War 1 called mechanical computers. they can make calculation by usinf levers and gears. that way when they are up ther and send robots these can last longer and take data in, casue the modern computer tend to be fragile to heat. And in venus there is alot of heat. i believ the author really gave good details to why it is a good idea to studybthis amazing planet and really supported it now will see what time will show us. if we are the right thing like the aouthor writes ""we should meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Driveles cars are on the rise and should be allowed everywhere, but only after all the problems are solved. These cars are what soccer moms and very successfull bussiness men been praying for. The self steer aspect of the car helps moms tend to their crazy children who wont stay seated, without the consequence of a crash or worse. Bussiness men can hold conference calls and maybe even do some paperwork during their drive. When the car comes across a difficult terrain it asks you to take over, this may be a problem in the future. These cars will evolve and so will the people who drive them. Humans may be so use to not touching the wheel, that when the car needs their assistance they wont know what to do. Driveless car would be a magnificent addition to the evolution of technology but in my mind I think the driveless vehicle should be a mode that the cars can go on not just the whole car being independent. Put it in this perspective....fifty to hundred years from now the driveless cars are the most distributed brand of transportation and isn't looking to depleat. A particular person is on the highway and is on their way to work. They fall asleep because ithe road looks clear anf they figure they car won't need their assistance, but little do tehy know its a enormous crash a mile ahead. The car is asking for their assistance but their not waking up. What would the car do? Stop right in the middle of the highway or continue to drive.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,3,1
"Today, there are advance technology in the society such as computers, cars, cell phones, and etc but no one ever tried to develop an driverless cars. Today in our society, many people tried to develop new technologies because things are getting more advanced an effective. Driverless cars are one of their plan, where the cars has sensors and know what to do. I agree the development of driverless cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there is still alert in the car.

The driverless cars should be develop and introduced to the soiety because the cars uses less fuel than the cars we used today. The text states, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" From this example we can tell that the cars is great because they used less fuel than the the cars we sued today. Thus, people do not have to worried about they will ran out the fuel when they're driving. Most of the people loved to use cars that used less fuels because they do not have to spend much money on the fuel. The text also states, ""Offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This example shows that the driverless cars have more rooms than a bus. People to sit in a place where there is not croweded because it's comfortable. Driverless cars solved the overcroweded the problem because it got more spaces. Thus, I agree the development of the cars.

While the driverless cars used less fuel, the cars can drive million miles without a crash. The text states, ""Their cars have driven more than half million miles without a crush."" This example tells us that the car is safer than the cars we drive today. If a car can drive million miles without any crashing then we considered it's an great car because most of the cars were not safe and it gets into car accident very often.

The most important is that there are still alert in the car. The text states, ""...Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of hallways."" This example shows that when there is something happened to the car, the cars will alert the driver that there is something going on but most of the cars do not have that kind of technique. Second, the text states, ""Dealing with comlicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This example shows that when there is an major accidents or traffic issues then the car will alert you to move out the car quickly before anything happened. In other hand, people disagree to develop the driverless cars. The text states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless cars that still needs a driver?"" They claimed that the driverless cars should do everything by itself instead having the dirver controlling it. They think there is no difference if we use a normal car. I disagree with them because it's safer if we have a real driver in the car, they'll prevent anything bad happened.

Driverless cars can have more advanced technique in the future when there are more people supporting it. Thus, we should not give up on developing the cars because the cars uses less fuel, less car accidents, and there are still alert in the car that helped people to know what happened.",4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The author does a good job supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains how Venus is the most similar planet to Earth.

The author also points out that Venus is sometimes Earths closest neghboring planet which would help with the time of space travel. It is made clear in the artical that scientist want to learn more about Venus and that the author supports them, now lets see examples the author gives us to support these claimes.

In the artical ""The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus"" the author describes how Earth and Venus are the two most similar planets, as shown in the text ""Astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This exerpt shows that Venus is a very special planet that needs to be reserched even though it is dangerous. In the artical the author says Venus is sometimes the closeset planet to Earth making space travel easier. ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.""

The last point I have is it is clear that scientist and the author both share in the fact that they think it is important to learn more about Venus, an example of this in the text is ""Striving to meet the challenge ppresented be Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" That exerpt shows how not only the author feels but also how scientist feel about exploring Venus.

I think it is clear that the author has done a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. The author used several different examples listed in the before paragraphs to show how the reward was greater than the risk.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"Having a car that will drive on its own is cool and all, but when you think about it it could be very dangerous. People in todays society are very lazy. All most people do now in days is sit at home, sleep, eat, or watch televison. So I dont think having a driverless car is such a good idea.

See people today get used to things quick without really noticing that they are used to it. For example television, its a great invention but people over use it. Some people make television their top priority. People even use television as an excuse. It stops them from making interactions with the real world, because people have grown to be lazy.

Another example is a cellphone. Everywhere you go everyone has a type of cellphone, wether it's a smartphone or a flip phone. People are so drawn to their phones especially teenagers. Everyone is on some type of social media sight, wheter it's facebook, instagram, snapchat, etc. Again everyone is making technology their top priority.

Having a car that can drive itself isn't really a good idea. We as humans get lazy over just little things, so imagine having a driverless car. What if someone in the driverless car falls asleep? In the passage it says this ""driverless car"" isn't so accurate. Meaning it can't drive itself completely. The driver still has to be alret of whats going on. So knowing us as humans and how we are why would anyone want to make a driverless car.

I honestly believe this car will be dangerous. SOmeone could fall asleep from getting too comfortable, again us being humans and getting used to things, causing the driver to possibly get into a car accident not only risking themselves but other pedestrians.

I am not in anyway shape or form trying to say technology is bad, but if it isnt used correctly it can be a dangerous thing. I beleive only people who are responsible and mature and know right from wrong are the ones who caan handle this type of technology. These ""driverless cars"" are not for everybody.",2,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"Why do you think the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit disregarding the danger that is being presented.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth which is why it is referred to as the Earths ''twin''. Most people study geography which is all around the world such as Earth. Meanwhile, others are studying or learning more about venus . Such as , venus is more dangerous because of how close it is to the sun and carbon dioxide that revolves around it.

The temperature is also an effect on how dangerous it is .

Even though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet . This can result in erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes .Others on the other hand are fascinated by Venus because it has been the most Earth - like planet in our solar system . Earth is covered of different bodies of water and that could support different forms of life. Venus a very long time ago ,was also covered in large oceans which help others to adapt to . Planetary visiters put the option of venus out there because of its physical features such as valleys,mountains and craters. The NASA is sending people who are intrested in studying space and planets to visit Venus.

The people who are going to traveling on ship will not see as much due to the dense atmosphere .You aren't going to be able to take sample of things from a distance because of the risk that will be taken . Risk like taking resources from the planet can harm you . They are making different ways to travel to venus so it would be worth the time period and not limited.

The authors has used a good choice of words by saying ''that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presesnt . The trip would be very observative and informational . The danger in getting over there and staying there for a long time would be harmful . It would be a good to learn about because it has so many things to offer and inform you about .",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it represents because it been known that Venus is similar to earth. Venus is a extrodinary planet and humans can survive there . This planet is excellent for flying in outer space. Venus has impacted the way humans are exploring other planets.

Venus has had bad reputation for the extreme temperatures ,but the good side of is that you can still survive. It states in the text,"" At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degress fahrenheit ,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This is explains that the conditions are hot ,but it won't be that harmful to your skin. You can take cold deep showers and see the happiness of others. It would also be healthy for you because the sun will help you get in some of your vitamins. Another reason, why Venus is a good place because of the rocky surfaces. In the text it states ,"" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life, just like Earth.Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky features such as valleys,mountains,and craters."" This was very long time ago, but since sciencetist haven't been sent always up there is there a possible chance that you could play around or touch the ground,how or smell your surroundings. Also, you could even ride your jet airplane because you will able to avoid the conditons like snow and rain since your above the sky . Another reason, would be that using your phone could be a possiblity. The cool thing that no one has ever invented a device that can stand in hot conditons you could be the first person to have people live there. It states,"" Modern computers are enormously powerful,flexible,amd quick ,but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just image exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin."" This is trying to say that the phones of computers will bust into flames because your exposing so much heat into the technology. The bright side of that even though it can cause damages you'll be able to explore nature without always being dependable on your phone. People will stop being so addcitive they can be more social with other humans. Venus has a lot ways it can change humans and also the inventions that can be invented.

Venus is planet that has been related to earth and its totally true because you can live their without dying . People could use their own imaginatons make up anything.The planet could be more of a green planet. Yes , Venus has it's risks , but what is the ponit of living if you don't know what is furher ahead than earth like Venus. Venus has a way of livng new experriences .",2,2,1,1,0,1,0,0,0
"I believe that NASA or any other space organizations could have a chance to visit other planets, or such as the ""Evening Star"". Just by reading this article made me think on how this could realy work but only in a matter of time could this happen. My claim to ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a positive response because

the author talked about in the story on how thick the atmosphere is, the temperature and the enviroment is like. Venus is a risk to travrel too, but in the long run it'll be worth it.

Earths twin is most likely a deadly plant for right now we could possibly try another solution by visiting it. In paragraph 5 it said ""A vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian Landscape"" to avoid the 170 degrees Fahrenheit surface its good to make suggestions and try it out on earth before taking it to venus. I agree on having robots visiting venus first before letting humans try for themselves is way better and safe. Robots are made to survive longer then humans for these types of missions, They could bring us information that humans probably could not and would last longer in different climates.

Venus is a deadly planet, But is the second choice if planet Earth would ever

be in a dangerous sitituation and would have to evacuate. Better now then never, If i had the chance to expeirment id take that chance because evenatually Earth wont last forever. It would be a great idea to start now and help our future to be in a safe place. I would make the most of what i got here on Earth to help my grandchildern be alive in the future. Thats why i strongly believe on Venus to being a second home for us to live and see our gerenration of humans live long and forever and keep expanding.",1,2,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Driverless cars are very interesting to disscuss. They can be so helpful, but there are downsides to them. Thoughts about whether they are great or horrible will vary from person to person. Some people might think both. I would be one of those people that think both are true. There are many arguments both ways. All of them seem logical. All is understandable to think what everyone is thinking about them.

One reason that they are great would be that it means the driver would be able to do other tasks instead of drive. The person in the car could do their own thing rather than focus on all that comes with driving a car which can be a lot to focus on at one time. One major reason that it could be a bad thing is that anything thats made can malfunction, which could cause many things to happen. If it did malfunction people could get hurt or possibly die. Then the question comes down to who would be responsible if something like this were to happen. The driver owns the car yet wasn't actually driving so would the manufacturer be responsible? The manufacturer can't be held accountable because things that are made break and mess up constantly. The driver also can't be responsible, because they were not driving and they have no control over if the car does something it's not supposed to do.

Both sides of the argument make total sense. They can be so helpful, but they have a possiblity of causing harm to innocent people. Once they figure out who would be responsible if something bad were to ever happen or they can promise nothing will ever happen, which they can't, everything would be so much easier. Driverless cars could potentially be a great idea. It just depends on how you look at things like this.",1,2,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irration. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The electoral college is unfair to voters, because of the winner-take-all system in each state. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders.

The electoral college also has some good reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. In the 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Obama won cause of the electoral college. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a lanslide electoral-vote victory in that state. So one good reason is the certainty of outcome.

Also another awesome reason is that the electoral college requires a presidental candidate to have transregional appel. No regions has enogh electoral votes to elect a president, so the south cant elect a president that will do something in favor with the south only. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. it avoids run-off elections.

My final answer is that i argue in favor of the electoral college. It would be hard to let every single citizem chose, because some people dont think about others and what it is good for all, people only think about themselfs and what it is good for themself. Plus the even thogh the president will win no matter if he/she won the popular vote. The electoral votes think for the state and what is good for the people.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Think of this, ""car-free cities"". To about 90 percent of Americans this idea may sound outrageously retarded. why? well, for those who own a car their car is extremely important to them because it's their form of transportation, but also think of the harm that cars have done in just the past decades. Our global warming levels have rose dramatically and cars are one of the so many reasons. Not just that, think of all the deaths that have been involved with car accidents. All this can be stopped if we learn how to manage our car usage.

I'm not saying that cars should be banned or not used at all in our country, but we most definitely do need to be less dependent on our cars. Some places have already started the movement of car-free cities like in VAUBAN, Germany. They have given up their cars and have adjusted to a whole new life style. In the article ""car-free cities"" paragraph 3, a women named Heidrun Walter shares her opinion. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Not only can it be beneficial, but some people actually like the idea.

Now lets think of air pollution that has rose our global warming levels. If you were to ask someone ""what's the biggest reason for global warming""? The first thing that would come to mind to almost everyone would be air pollution caused by cars. This isn't just in the US, this is going on everywhere in the world, but some places are finding solutions for this problem. For example, in the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" paragraph 1, it says ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"". That's a perfect example of limiting car usage that can be extremely beneficial to us and our earth.

Some people may ask, ""how can you limit your car usage"" Well, you can ride your bike to work, take public transportation, and also walk. Riding your bike to work or walking to where you need to go can be an advantage to yourself. Many Americans are so inactive due to their cars because it can take you anywhere, but if you go out and walk or ride a bike to where you're going you're helping yourself out, and no it's not like you have to do it every day, but its just a way that we can manage our car usage and it would be more helpful than you think.

If we all take that big step and want to make a difference to our earth and its air pollution, we can achieve it. We don't necessarily have to be ""car-free"" we just all have to learn how to manage our car usage to make the big help. There would be less air pollution, our global warming levels would drop, there could be less car accidents, and less deaths. These advantages of limiting our car usage could just about save our lives and our earth.",2,2,3,2,0,0,1,1,1
"After a presidential election, citizens soon start to realize that their word doesn't matter. The Electoral College are the voters that mean more to the presidential candidates, and it is a disrespectful system to be the face of our ways of democracy. In these sources citizens and governors want to abolish this system of voting and deciding a blind fate for America. The people vote for the electors not the president, the electors elect the president not the people, and the possibility of the disaster factor happening on future elections. Popular vote doesn't seem to have much of a purpose anymore because the electors seem to be making the desicions in this country.

Starting off, the people of this country need to know on what they are voting on rather from what they thought they could of been voting on. The Office of the Federal Register state,"" You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president"" (soure 1). They insist that we are basically voting for a possibility to get the candidate we want or to be betrayed and vote for the other party. Truly this means that this system is cheap and could backfire. Not only that but half or a little over half of citizens seem to take responsibility to vote, in that case it makes it harder to get the electoral votes to go in favor of popular votes. Our votes only exsist to help choose votes.

Asisting the first claim, our votes are unexistent. Richard A. Posner claims,""it is the electors who elect the president , not the people""

(source 3). Right of the bat the Constitution and it's preamble is disrespected by this system. The preamble says that we as citizens of this country are the voice of this land and would further on insist or choose what we want it to be known as. But, that can't necessarily happen if we don't vote. Posner also says "" ( and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (source 3). Even though this is a fact there is still the possibility or the potential to be nailed or betrayed by the electors. If there is a possibility in something unfair to happen by law it should be taken down and changed for our safety. Yet this happened in 2000 , when W. Bush aquired more electoral votes than Gore but Gore had more popular votes. A plurality only has a chance to win electoral votes.

additionally, the system could supposively allow for much worse tricks and grief. Bradford Plumer describes ""The single best argyment agaisnt the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor"" (source 2). The disaster factor includes legislatures replacing the Democratic electors with new ones and this happened in the 2000 fiasco. This is were the popular votes and higher that the electoral votes given to the president. Knowing that the legislatures could succesfully replace or revise or votes into the opposing party. Voting campaigns seem to just be a game , the electors want to win so 17 sates didn't even have the chance to see the candidates at all. This is the system sudgested by our founding fathers and it is a mockery to let it stay and bring judgement to our votes.

It is humorous to and unfair to see the electoral college take over our votes. It seems that our votes are only seen as jokes. As if the whole preamble was a way to joke around with the citizens and give them hope. Many governors want to Abolish the electoral college, and most of us should take responsibility to vote for this and dismantle the electoral college from ever taking over our voice. The disaster factor, the way on how the electors decide, and how we vote for the electors not the president, are prime examples on how irrational this system is. The only way to get our voice back is to ablolish it and start over fresh with a new system in mind.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I would hate driverless cars. Now the only reason why I would hate it is because, I love to drive it is one of my favorite things to do.

"The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" presents a well written case on why mankind should continue to look for ways to explore Venus. The author presents the article starting off with information on Venus and how its challenges inhibit scientists from exploring it. They present the challenges in an orderly way, how scientists may be able to counter these challenges, and why it is so important to get there.

Getting to Venus will be the easiest part of the task that scientists are faced with. In paragraph 2 the author states ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus"". Getting to Venus is the easiest part of the task, but staying there will be exponentially harder. In paragraph 3 the author presents the many challenges scientists have to face to be able to stay on Venus following the logos method. These include but are not limited to ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide..."", ""clouds of of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."", and ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". That is just the atmosphere, not including Venesian geology and weather.

Despite all these challenges, the author believes scientists should keep trying to study Venus and shows some ways that scientists have already begun to take on the problems presented. In paragraph 5, the author cites NASA's possible solution on how to counter the surface of Venus. NASA wants ""scientists to float above the fray"" in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". Despite getting here the author presents another problem in paragraph 6 with scientists getting ""only limited insight on ground conditions"" because of the dense atmosphere. To counter that problem, the author cites another NASA approach to studying Venus which includes ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide"" and ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"".

With all these challenges and oftentimes complicated solutions the author supports the idea that through all the trials and errors the payoff would be significant to satisfaction and provoking of human curiosity. In paragraph 4 the author claims ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". Being able to reach Venus's surface would enable explorers to look for life no matter how big or small and see if it was possible to survive the harsh environment. Even more so, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" which would help scientists to determine how Venus was formed. The author appeals to pathos in paragraph 8 stating ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". The author wants the reader to understand that mankind as a whole should not shy away from the challenges presented no matter how dire the situation and should face it head on, if for no reason other than the question ""Can we do it?"".

The author presents their information in an orderly fashion, makes their article easy and clean to read, and appeals to pathos and logos. They go in-depth on the situation, the solution, and why mankind should worry about it in the first place. All in all it is a quick and concise article that was well done and well supported.",5,4,4,4,2,3,3,3,3

This describes that Venus is a very challenging place to study. No one has been to Venus in less than three decades ago. ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"" This will be hard for anyone going to Venus and studying the planet because temperatures are very dangerous up there considering it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is a worthy pursuit to study dispite from its danger it presents in many reasons. Venus is a part of our solar system, and it's also important.

Earth is often concidered just like Venus, they are like twins but only reffered by density and size. Venus had ben proved a very challenging place to examine and to study. It may be the closest to the sun but safe vantage point of Earth. Mars and Venus are actually Earth neighbors.

Concering that Venus is by the Sun it must be hot there. Well that's correct, on the planet surface the tempeture is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atomsphric is over 90 times greater than we experienced on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface in any planet in our solar system although Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is 10 times hotter. With that type of heat it's like erupting volcanos, earthquakes, lighting strike, and even more.

You might ask yourself why do scientists want do travel to Vensus at all for new imormation with that type of heat? Well they are fascinated by it as well as you are reading this story. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration also know as NASA, wants to be able to sent humans to Venus, but wiht heat like that it is impossiable. Even sending a rover wouldn't last a day. Over 800 degrees is very hot for a 30 or so miles vehicle. Wouldn't be easy conditions for the rover or humans.

In conclusion, Venus is the brightest and dangerest planet yet has to be the most fascinating , most information ever. Venus is the cloest planet and the hotest. Studying the planet Venus is very interesting. Striving to meet the challange to be on the planet is dificult. Our travel to Venus will soon come to being able to live on it. Scientists are trying to find more imformation and figure out what can be done and what can not. For these reasons i think studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Germany-Residents of this rising community are suburban pioneers, Leaving in where few soccer mums are at or commuting executives have ever gone before:

they must have giving up their cars.

""It's about forbidden border lines and in this experimental"". The new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, of the French and Swiss border not to say ""Vauban's streets are completely Car free"". There is to be said to be a dowtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on on edge on the community.

However the thing is there is Car ownership it all comes down to  only those who have $40,000, along with a house. As the result states, only Vauban's families don't own cars the estimate is 70 percent. And the other half has 57 percent cars to move here. ""When I had a car life was always tense. I'm say that ""Heidrun Walter you Sir, haven't enjoyed life as much But atleast you are still in shape that't is for sure !""

Vauban, completed in 2006 , is the best example growing trending topic in the roots of Europe, the United states have much different ways to travel then else-where to separates suburban life from the the life style the U.S(United states) and made it a chance to start a new begining a new era, with car's to make a new component that is givin to them is called ""smart planning.""

The Automobiles are linchpin of the suburbs, where the middle-class families are from Chicago to Shanghai to have the nerve to make their homes. And as we know that, that's what the experts say, for now they shall say that. And there is a huge impimentation to current efforts to decrease life's drastically reducing greenhouse from the tailpipes as it was said to be done . . . .

Passenger cars are resonsible for 12 percentof the gass emissons in Europe . . . and it's said to be that, ""50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""

While it has been two decades to make the cities less denser then before, and better for walking , plans are all falling into the concept of the suburbs . . . Vauban, home to the 5,500 residents within a rectangular squre mile, it might be the most advanced experimentation in low-car suburban life has had. But its still a change as we precepts are adopted around the world to make the suburan race to be more compacted to get more accessability to public transportation, with less space for parking.

In other words in this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on the main street  that is, If rather than in malls along some distant highway. The artical states that ""All of the development in this same old War in World War II to center their main attentions , That the car will have to change"", said by David Goldberg, an official Transportation Licencing for the America, a fast-growing coalition of hundereds of groups in the United States . . . who are premoting new communities that are less dependent on cars, Mr. Goldberg says adding on: ""How much will you be willing to drive as it is important as you whether you have a hybird.""

Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread-out homes with private dreams in towns in the late 1950s and still exerting a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more Vauban-like, not only did the developing of the countries but also in the developing of the world, where emissionsives from such in increase number rating of private  cars are owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities and such.

In other words, In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency (U.S.E.V.P.A) are premoting ""car reductions"" communities, and the legistlative branch are starting to take an act, if cautiously is what it takes. Many experts expect public transportation is serving the suburbs to play a much more larger role in a new six-year federal transportational bill to be approved this year, Mr. Goldberg claims and says.

In previous past bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by gone to law gone to the highways and only 20 percent to other of these highly organized transportaions. Hopefully this contant won't be Copy righted as it says by the Autor Elisabeth Rosental all of this is for educational practices. Hopfully you guys will enjoy this essay.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some people argue that a new technology callled the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read emotional expressions of students. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom. The use of the new technology to read students expression should be used because it can help communicate, it can help identify certain things, and it can help teachers.

The new facial techonolgy could help with communcation in classroms. In paragrapgh 6 it states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang."" ""So computers need to understand that, too"". This shows how this new technology helps communication between other humans be more understanding. Also, knowing what someone is really feeling when a conversation is being held in a classroom. Instead of students hiding their emotions teachers will really know how kids are feeling.

FACS, the Facial Ation Coding System is improving other techonolgy. According to paragrapgh 8 it says that to an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. This reveals how identyify humans emotions could be accurate even when they face may look like something else. Also, being in a classroom it would help determine if a student is lying by a guilty look students may try and hide. This technology could help the classroom in many other situations.

The FACS could help out teacher in various situations in class. In paragraph 6 it cites that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This shows how the coding system could help teachers spot out the right students who needs help. In some situation where teachers may ask students do everyone understand something and someone is not brave enough to speak up and say no and move one without knowing what to do this could help teachers know wether students truly understand or maybe not on task. The new technology, the Facial Action Coding System gives teachers relieable and accurate information about students which will help out teachers tremendously.

The use of the new electronic device used to read students expression should be used because it can help communicate, it can help identify certain things, and it can help teachers. Using the Facial Action Coding System in class to determine emotional expression of students is valuable.The techonology provide helpful use according to Dr. Huang.",3,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Dear,

State senator

I am righting to you today about about a very important topic, I am here to tell you that I believe we should change from Electoral College to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. There are many reasons why we should do this transaction.

First reason, why we should change to election by popular vote is because Electoral College is very unfair to the the people running for presdient, and the people voting. Its unfair mostley because of the winner-take-all system in each state. This system is ridicolus because a lot of candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. I know a lot of crazy systems like this are making people not want to vote anymore, which is not good.

Another great reason, why we should change from the Electoral College to election by popular vote is because of how out of date and irrational the Electoral College actually is. Us the people of the United States don't even get to vote for our next president directly, you help choose your state's electors when you vote for president because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. The way the Electoral College handles ties is unprofessional to many, becasue all they do is throw the election to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.

In Conclusion, As you can see Mr. Senator Me and many others would really enjoy if the Electoral College was changed to election by popular vote. The reason being is because of how the Electoral College is unfair and irrational.

Sincerley, PROPER_NAME",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Car usage is very popular in this world we have come to know. It used for many means of transportation like going to work, school, social events, or just simply going shopping or hanging out with friends. Those are some up sides to having  and using a car. But they are some down sides as well. I will be explaining the down sides of using a car as well as the advantages of limiting car usage.

My first reason in this topic that i have chosen to tell you about are ""Car-free"" cities. what are Car-free cities? well the name says it all is a new project they are working on in europe of this city who is car free. This new city has no cars, no street parking, no driveways or or home garages. Why do they exist? well the obvious answer is to minimize car pollution that are creating green house gases and are polluting the air and more places can adopt this idea and have more ""car-free"" cities so we can save the planet and ultimately save our selves from extinction because we did not know how to maintain our planet clean. Also a thing a like about this new ""Car-free"" city is that  theres a main street where theres all the stores at a walking distance like how great is that? u can just take a ten to twenty minute walk and go shopping for anything like grocerys, shoes, clothe, restaurants instead of driving to a mall along some distant highway and ultimately that is where everybody is so hanging out with your friends and meeting all up in one place is at a walking distance and if you dont have any friends well you make new friends at this main street because that is where everybody is.

Another great reason for considering less car usage is less traffic. Who does not like less traffic? everybody hates traffic is slow, boring, and annoying. Now if we have less traffic that means we have less commute time when trying to get to work if you have a job that is far from your home and that means you get to work sooner and on time and hopefully get a raise because you feel like you dont get paid anough to do what you do. Also if we have less traffic we have less commute time and what does that mean? well it can mean multiple things like having more time to sleep because you dont have to worry about waking up early to beat the morning traffic like my mom and plenty of other people do. At the end of the day you will be able to get home quicker so you can spend more time with your family and do stuff you usually cant because of the time you spend at traffic.

My last reason is a very important reason and it is simply ""safety"". Think about it, it is simply just common sense. if they are less cars in the road at one time then the chances of car accidents decreases. Now i dont know about you but that sounds like a win win to me. One theres less accidents so theres less people in the hospital so they dont have hospital bills to worry about and less accidents means less traffic as well. And also if you ban the cars for a day or have one of them ""car-free"" cities you have less drunk drivers; one because they dont have a car so they will probably just drink at home and two if the bar or where ever is that there going to drink is close enough then they can just ""walk"" there sober and ""walk"" back to the house drunk instead of being in a car a causing a fatal accident.

Ultimately i feel that the usage of cars should be limmited because of many reasons. This reasons are as follows. Less car pollution. living in a car-free city so you are able to walk everywhere. Less traffic, less commute time, having more time to do stuff. and last but not least the safety of drivers. personally i think we should supervise the usage of automobiles and have more ""car-free"" cities and have days where car usage is baned or restricted by some amount.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Driving cars are something that many people are looking forewards to in the future. These driving cars are being invented and take alot of money to make. Some of the questions that you may ask yourself are how do they work, where will they work, and are they safe? I personally like the idea of having cars drive by themselves. The reason why is because ther wouldn't be that many accidents, people wouldn't have to worry about getting ran over, and if the driver is drunk or ill they wouldn't cause any wrecks.

They started to put these cars together in the late 1900's. In 1950 GM made a concept car that would run on a track with an electric cable that sent radio signals to the receiver on the front of the car. GM tried to imput these electric cables on the roads but it costed to much to remake the roads. They tried many different methods to make these cars drive but they didn't succed. Until around the year 2000 when technology was starting to advance and played a huge role in our society.

Now these cars have highly imputed sensors that help the car run and keep the driver alert if something malfunctions. These cars also have implied brakes to stop the car in an emergency and vibrating sensors to notify the driver that it needs human skill to help it. These sensors will help detect that something is wrong and to keep the car on the road. There would also be less accidents. Teens would have help from the car and parents help too and wouldn't get in many wrecks.

Finally these cars have pass certain laws and have certain laws put in order to put the cars on the road and also help if the driver gets in a wreck.. Driveless cars have to have a lot more technology imputed so in case of a major emergency it will be able to protect the driver and passengers in the car.

In conclusion many car companies are starting to make driveless cars so we have to be more opened minded and keep up with technology, because our world is going to be changed dramatically and we have to be ready for big changes. These cars are only the beginning of something big. That will change our society in the furture. So what are your thoughts about all this new information?

Are you for or aganist driveless cars?",2,3,0,2,0,0,1,1,1

Also the Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in france , compared to a 5.3 percant average of the diesel engimes in the rest of western Europe , according to reuters. Still however indicates The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog and the Violators faced $25 fines. The Article also states As April  2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below th peak and equal to where the country was in januart 1995.

One Reason, Fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of controll because in the article Ingerman Suburb,Life Goes On Without Cars states Automoblies are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle- class familes From chicago to shanghai tens to make their homes and that , experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpies for the passenger car are responsibe for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50 percent in sime car intensive areas in the united states. But in paris bans driving dur to smog takes about while exceptions were made for plug in cars,hybrids, and carrying three or more passengers.

Another Reason,fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage are going out of control because it incates President obamas ambitions goals to curb the united staes greenhouse gas emissons, unveiled lastweek, will get a fortuitios assist from an incipient shoft in american behavior also recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each years goes by. the days without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in bogotoa in the mid 1990s.

"Dear senator in the sources ""What is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defences of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer  and also ""In Defense of the Electoral College: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" by Richard A. Posner, the authors of the article discuss the pros and cons to having an electoral college. The citizens of the United States would be more pleased if the electoral college stayed as opposed to it being ebolished.

To begin, having a electoral college will be better for the nation and people.

for example, the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing a president"" the article states ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is very possible- it happened in 2000- but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" this claim provides a true statement on reasons why we should keep the electoral college. This statement means that disputes are less likely with their method and their is a certainty of an outcome.

Although keeping the electoral college is a valid idea, there are some problems associated with keeping the electoral college as well. Of course, there are difficulties with in the curcumstsance where we keep the Electoral Collage opposed to disspose of it. the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Plumer made several claims opposing of the electoralcollege, such claims include ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters"" and opinons like ""Its official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irration"". While Plumer did put his point across as to how the system is unfair we must take into consideration how it is more reasonable and appropriate, in ""in defense of the electoral college: five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" the article states that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal"" which is fair and less stressful.

in summary, the best option would to keep the way things are rather than changing things up and and creating a more stressful, unorganized system. Although Plumer made accurate claims as to some of the faults in the system, there was far more proof in keeping the electoral college and keeping things the same.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Venus or the ""Evning Star"" is one of the well known planets in our solar system.on previous missons to venus not a single spacecraft was able to survive landing for hours.This may explain why the callenges NASA is having for humans to study this planet,eventhought venus is pretty close to Earth.Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,that makes it even more callenging for humans to land on venus.

"There are many ways you can do things without using cars as transportation. In these two sources, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars,"" and ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" they all explain how you can do things without have to use cars for transportation.

In the source, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars,"" it explains that in Vauban, Germany, people have given up their cars to live a better, suburban life. In paragraph 3, Heidrun Walter states, ""When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" This shows that people can be happier living a suburban life by walking, riding bikes, etc. without having to use a car for transportation. Not only does has this made it easier, but has made the city denser.

In the source, ""Car-free day is spinning intoa big hit in Bogota,"" it explains that in Bogota, Columbia, people started a campaign called Days Without Cars, which basically is supposed to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This is a good way to lower air pollution and help make transportation a lot less stressful. In paragraph 20, it states, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" This shows that without using cars for transportation, there will be less traffic jams and it will be easier to get to places.

In conclusion, people prefer to live a suburban life and use transportation without cars rather than with cars. This makes transportation a lot easier and you can get to places without being stressed out by traffic jams. This also keeps the country less poluted.",2,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"The idea of driverless cars is exremely crazy, and doesn't make any sense. Creating a 100% hands free car is just another way to make America more lazy than we already are. Completely driverless cars are too big of a leap considering all the accidents that still occur with the drivers hand are on the wheel, and manufacturers still want to create a car that mimics the skill of a human? What if a malfunction occurs while the car is in motion? What if someone gets injured? These things must be considered if safety is a big concern.

The most important thing when driving is keeping your eyes on the road at all times. However, manufacturers are planning on inserting in-car entertainment which is more than likely going to result in the drivers taking their eyes of the road. What about the flashing lights on the windshield? That sounds like a great idea! No seriously, how dangerous is that? If they're too into the in-car entertainment they may not even see the flashing lights. Or the worst case senario the driver could be sleep, bored from having to wait their turn to drive or just sitting there in general.

"All around the world different countries have been noticing some things in life that are just better without cars or atleast less cars. With less cars things are more calming; its also better for everyone, including the enviroment.

To begin with, things can be way more calm in a life without cars. Many people happen to beleive that cars can change how you feel for example ""When i had a car i was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(3). Heidrun Walter always felt tense with a car now she feels calm and relaxed. Life with less cars can be so much more relaxing without all the loud annoying noises cars make. In Vauban they are making some changes to how the people live so they can live more easy and calm. ""Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in a low-car suburban life.""(6). The way this civilization is all the people live close by and everything is close by so you dont really need a car. If everything is close by everything can be more fluent and calm.

In addition, it may be more calm without cars but it is also better for you and the enviroment. ""passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emission in europe... and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""(5). Wherever you are in the world greenhouse gasses will most likley affect your environment in some unnatrual way and that is not the best thing for you, the people you know, or all the plants and animals. Without cars polluting earth we would be way more healthy and many animals may not be endangered or extinct like they are today.""how much you drive is as important as whether you have a hybrid.""(7). If you drive less its not just better for the environment and your health it can also be better for your wallet. If you drive less you save money on gas that you can use for many other things. Overall driving less turns out to be better for everyone.

In conclusion, people driving less can make life easier and calmer, it is also better for people, plants, animals, and don't forget your wallet.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In today's world our environment is not as healthy as it was year's ago. There are many green house gases disturbing our atmosphere and our ozone layer. One of the main reasons this is happening is due to motor vehicals. Car's, trucks', motorbike's, gasoline powred or diesal powerd, they all hurt our environment. There are some place's that are trying to stop the gases from hurting us and it is helping.

Owning a car is an important way of transportation. It allows us to get from point A to point B in time's that would be much slower if we did not have a car. Yet car's and truck's can sometimes be hurtful. Owning a car can be cost effective, you must pay for the fuel that is hurting the atmosphere, if it breaks down you must pay for expensive parts and service. Even if you have the money and the time to own a car, you are realy still hurting the environment by burning fosil fuels and causing green house gases.

In some place's in the wrold they are reducing car usage. They are having national days where if you use your motor vehical you are to be charged by ticket for some money. In paris there was a week of regulated driving to reduce smog emision. On several day's of the week car's with even numbers on their tag were not able to drive. The next day the odd number did the same, if caught using a motor vehical you would be fined 22£ ($31). People were outraged and some were so angered they didn't like he law and got thier vehical impounded. That is how Paris did their part in helping the atmosphere.

In Bogota, Colombia they had a similar ocasion, but only for one day of the year. They have done the same thing on that specific day for the past 3 years, they too have been charged with tickets for $25 if found using a motor vehical. They also had this day in two other citys in Colombia, Cali, and Valledupar joined in on the fun of helping the environment.

In the U.S President Barack Obama has had goal's to also reduce emision's of motor vehicals. The United State's being one of the main counrty's in car production see's owning a car a culture, they see driving, working on your own car, and racing as a way of life. But some american's have had enough of trafic jam's, stressed out lives in a jam packed city full of car's and truck's causing green house gases. They have reduced the miles driven since 2013, and a good amount of people don't even want to have a license. In crowded city like New York they have started a new bike sharing program, their tolls for bridges and tunnels have skyrocketed. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009. This means people are getting more involved in helping the environment and reducing hurtful gases that hurt our ozone and our atmosphere.",2,2,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"I want to create an argument against these driveless cars. i believe that these cars are not safe , because i think that all the technolagy in the car can like screw up and it could cause a explosian or a circuit. It may sound really cool to have a driveless car but there is some negative stuff about these cars. For instance when you have a teen thats learning how to drive , how are they going to learn when this car does it for you.

I mean yeah the car can tell us when to stop or when to drive with caution but what if and elderly person was using this car, they wouldnt be used to the car telling you all of this and whats gonna happen? , crashes are gonna happen and people are going to die because of these cars. Also what if one day you forget to pull up your window and it starts raining, all that technical stuff is going to get wet and it may stop working or when your getting ready to drive it and it messes up and tells you diffrent things , like ""turn here"" when your not sopposed to .

These smart cars are not going to be good because the motor they have are to silent and your not going to be able to hear as loud as a normal motor , and that means thay when you cant hear a car coming your going to want to cross the street and your going to get ran over.

If your bind or you cant hear then your not going to know when these cars are going to be coming. What we need is car that slows us down when we are going to fast or a car that doesnt let you drive it if your drunk. Lets say your driveless car one day stops working for some reason , or like something goes wrong with the elictrical stuff, that would take alot of time and money to fix because your not just fixing any car or getting in to just any motor, these cars are going to have a lot of wires connecting everywere and its going to take a person with alot of expierience with these cars to fix , not just any machanic is going to be able to fix this car , and since theres going to be alittle bit of people that know how to fix these cars there going to want to charge alot of money to leave your car nice and running again, and if they cant find the part you need your gonna have to waite more time until they find it and that means your not gonna have a car until its ready.

Yes this car sounds fantastic because it tells you when to do this and when to look out for stuff but my oppinion is that if you want one of these cars your going to have to be REALLY careful my friend.l",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,1

If its so dangerous is there reasoning behind wanting to learn more about this red hot planet?

Is there a chance that something could possibly live there again?

Venus, a planet that is much like our own in many ways, is a very dangerous yet mysterious place.

NASA says that at one point, according to paragraph 4, Venus could have been largely covered by oceans.

Meaning that if it had water there is a slight chance that Venus could have inhabbited living things such as plants or bacteria.

So now that NASA believes that there is a possibility that life could have occured on Venus at one point in time, why would they want to continue to explore it.

If Venus had life on it some point in the past then there is a possibility that there could still be something there or that maybe even one day in the far future something could live there again, possibly including the human species.

Then instead of vacationing to another country for a break you could vacation to an entirely different planet.

If they continue to explore they could figure out so much more about this planet and possibly what we could do to save Venus and be able to have oceans and landforms and living creatures back on our sister planet.",1,2,1,1,0,1,1,2,2
"I dont feel that FACS is valuable it has lots of things that can go wrong with it. Its a computer trying to read a human by the muscles of that persons face. The muscles on someones face is just to unpredictable to be read by a computer to the exact amount of happiness or sadness ect. a humans face can have false emotion.

The human face can show false emotion. Say that you and your friend are at a fun event or are having a good time and you see someone you dont like so you give them a dirty look with a mad face your not really mad you still happy but you have to have a mad face towards the person your mad at. There are so many more examples just like that. The robot cant predict what you are actually feeling cause there is alot more emotion behind a smile.

There are things they can do to make the system plossible such as making a part that scans your brain. If they made a brain scan with this technology it would be way more accurate and be able to see inside your head and see how you actually feel. If they add this technology it would prabaly be used alot more by companies and sold by retailers cause its would be inovative and way more accurate, but until then its not good enough for me to be convinced.",1,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"I agree that this technology is hepful, I believe it can help a lot of different people in many ways. I believe that this could be helpful because some kids/adults go through hard times and turn to death as an option. Many others may not agree with this technology because they don't want help nor do they want their emotions being able to be detected. This type of technology could help others in a various amount of ways. Here are some examples, a kid at home could be upset and the parents will never know because they don't pay attention to their childs emotions.

The parents would be required to do an everyday scan so they are aware of their childs emotions. Some parents could find out how their kids really feel and get them help. This technology could keep the suicide rate from uprising.

Doctors could use this in their offices to help patients. Especially infants, infants can't state how they feel. The doctor could scan the babies face and see their emotion.

"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.""

Those six emotions detectors could be very helpful. Who knows they might even come up with more emotions to detect. This could help large amounts of people. So I agree with this technology.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"What exactly is the facial action coding system? Well it enables computers to identify human emotions and expressions. This is an interesting way to understand a indivuals emotional expressions. Children in this mordern day have a tendency of hiding some deep emotions and expressional feelings from their peers,friends,and family. Being able to figure out some of their emotions could save a lot of problems long term.

The worst thing a person can do is hide their emotions from people. This can really lead to a bad depression or other sad emotional syndromes. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it stated that ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, etc."" This shows that a person understanding someone emotions is very diffucult. People can hide their feelings really well especially students when even they are having their worst day.

Facial action coding system can really help adults to understand the true emotions of a student. The story says that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insturctor."" This by far is an excellent idea. In the US in today's world a lot of students homework is online. Not even just homework at school but in everyday life it has something to do with technology.

By being said the students that can't comprehend the lesson, there can be an alternative assignment that they can to so at least they are learning something. Doing something that you kind of know and bettering yourself at that is way more benefical then doing something you have no knowledge of. A lot of students don't ask for help when they are struggling with a assignment. Most of the time they either skip it or copy down answer without getting the full structure of the material. If the students are not understanding something in a lesson the material is only going to get way harder for them without any help.

In the end, the facial coding system is a great creation and will be very benefical toward students. Teachers a very educated and have the Knowledge to help the students. If they don't know who is struggling though at all times they can't help every student.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"What's the Electoral College? Many people don't understand or don't know what its used for either. Its mostly used to decide who the president is going to be, but also for the popularity. The Electoral College is a helpful but harmful method, due to not updating the regulations of it. We should keep the Electoral College because thats what we've used since the beginning of our nation. Many people dont relise it but it does help us a lot when we have to decide who we want for president. My few reasons on why we should keep the Electoral College are, what happens with your vote, why we use the Electoral College.

Firstly, when you cast your vote it goes directly to an office to be counted and store for later. The Electors who cast the Real vote for the state look over the balets and decide who to vote for their state. Billions of people cast their votes but really only 270 count and those are the representatives for the states. You many think your vote doesn't count but in reality it does to the Electors of your state. We need to keep the Electoral College for our voters and to keep our tradition.

Secondly, we use the Electoral College to guid our electors on who the people want to lead our country and to help lead our country. Many people don't vote cause the lines are too long or they claim they don't have time but we really know that they don't care. Everyone should care cause we need everyone to vote and help the state electors choose who we want for president or who we want for other helpful positions.

Inconclusion, we need everyone to vote and we want them to know what happens to their vote. So Mr. Senator please dont take away the Electorak College.",2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To whom it may concern, I have recently been enlightened on what Electoral College is all about. According to ""What Is the Electoral college?"" Electoral college is a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and the election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. It consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress. As quoted also from ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register.

First of all, the Electoral College should be kept because no, one region has the ability to elect a president. A certain region can gather all it's people to favorite one of the candidates, but it still won't be enough to reach a biased conclusion in the final election. The candidates also cannot count on one of their favorite states or rven regions for them to win because, with only regional or state appeal, it will become unlikely for them to be a successful president.

In addition, having The Electoral College will ensure that the larger states can't overrule the smaller state based on population. It balances the weight of more populated states to smaller populated states. This is good because now, the smaller populated states will feel that they actually have power in the Election process instead of feeling left out due to a larger population. This is also significant because now the candidates won't aim their campaigning only towards the higher populated states. They will go all around the country trying to emphasize their importance in winning the campaign.

In conclusion, the obvious solution here is to keep using the Electoral College process. It not only ensures that one state or region does not have enough votes alone to sway the election, it allows the smaller populated states to have just as big of a say in the election as the larger states. The procedure of using The Electoral college has been around for quite a while now and it's clear why. It is the most beneficial way of ensuring that the right candidate will get into office, based off of the right terms.",3,3,0,3,2,2,2,1,3
"Dear, Florida State Senator

Right now there are many disputes and arguments over wether or not to keep the electoral college. Personally where I stand, I think that the electoral college should have less power, but not be totally rid. Reason for my opinion is that alot of times the electoral college has too much say, and we the people dont have enough say. For example, Barack Obama recieved 61.7% of the electoral vote compered to 51.3% of the popular vote. The electoral college had the most say and impact upon the outcome of the election. Most of the time electoral college makes mistakes on who they pick.

Everything they say is based of an intellectuall standpoint. The pick shouldnt be based off of all intellectuall. That doesnt mean the electoral college is bad, if it werent for them I think we the people are too stupid to make the decisons just ourselves. we need intellectual. Most voters dont even know much about who they pick. We shouldnt be trusted with all of the say in the election. Thats why we need electoral college to balance it out and make it right in the end. Alls im saying is dont give them all the say in who wins the election just lower it a bit to be 50-50.

Sincerely,

We the people ;)",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"Dear state senator,

Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twenty-two reads "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twenty-three states "" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.",3,4,2,3,1,2,2,1,1
"Cars may be a good source of travel, but, unknown to some, are dangerous to Earth and it's inhabitants.  Limiting car usage to bicycles, walking, or any other option is a good idea.  The reasons for this being that it makes traffic safer and, more importantly, reduces pollution.

To begin with, limiting use on cars makes traffic less of a hassle.  For example, in the text, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" the author of this source reports that the effects of not using cars is, ""-leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3 Selsky)  Notice how, even in a big city, the effects of not using cars are extremely noticeable.  If that car-free day makes it to EVERYWHERE in the planet, no more traffic-related nonsense will occur.  Furthermore, in the passage, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" a citizen by the name of Heidrun Walter states ""'When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.'"" (Source 1 Rosenthal)  Even she finds that the lack of a car makes life easier for her.  This statement, though some would prefer not to admit that they were tense drivers, is true, as being behind the wheel in a large amount of traffic could be stressful.  It is agreeable that the effects of not using cars shows how much better life would be if they were removed permanently.

In addition to reducing traffic, limiting the use of cars could decrease the amount of pollution.  To illustrate, in the excerpt, ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" Robert Duffer reports that, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Source 2 Duffer)  It is shocking that the amount of driving in that city caused so much pollution that they needed to enforce a law banning driving, a TEMPORARY law.  It is baffling how Paris didn't keep that law intact.  To add insult to injury, according to ""The End of Car Culture,"" Obama plans to curve the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, seein how ""-transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" (Source 4 Rosenthal)  Wow, driving causes such a large amount of emissions to the point that it is near the amount of power plant emissions.  It seems rather unbelievable, and some would wish that the article wasn't true, but the use of cars is practically killing humanity.  The point is that car usage is damaging Earth and preventing use would reduce the damage.

To wrap things up, reducing car usage would make traffic less of a risk and decrease pollution.  Perhaps it will make the planet a better place, or fail in the end and continue to hurt the land some would call ""home"".  Just remember this, when you continue to use whatever car you use, remember the dangers it may bring.",3,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,3
"Exploring Venus has its pros and cons. Both have its challenges and risks. Venus is a very interesting planet to study due to the fact that it is the only one like earth, but there are risks. throughout this essay I will tell you my reasoning on why the author didn't exactly prove to me that Venus is worth taking risks for.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way. However in the sixth paragraph the author states,"" Therefor, scientists seeking to conduct a throrough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This statement shows how the trip to Venus would be a waste of time if you cannot get on the surface. There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

In conclusion the author did not convinve me that traveling to venus is worthy expidition. The author mainly explained the cons of the study and did not provide too many pros. The author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"The electoral college must be replaced with popular vote because it's unfair to the people. The leaders are meant to be elected by the people and the electoral college elects electors to vote for you and they don't always vote for who you want. Most states have a ""winner takes all system"" in which the presidential candidate who recevies the most votes gets all the electoral votes from that state and even that isn't guranteed.

Some presidents have won popular vote but haven't won the election because of the electoral college. Some electors have even refused to vote for the candidate that they were elected to vote for. The worst case senario is that the election will be thrown to the House of Represntatives where the vote of millons of people now rests with less than a hundred. The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the ""winner takes all"" system. Candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't  get to see a single campaign add.

In source three it states that ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" There is no certainty that if enough votes go to a certain presidential candidate that he/she will be elected. Presidents Richard Nixon, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in ther time, agreed on abolishing the electoral college. When it comes down to it, the founding fathers had good intentions in trying to make it so that the people elected a president but, instead electors elected by the people get to vote for the president. It is unfair to the popular vote when more people vote for a certain presidential candidate but, they don't get elected. The electoral college is unfair and should be replaced by the popular vote.",2,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In the artical "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" It talks about an intracit software that is able to detect the emotions of someone just by their facial exspression. For instance they used Mona Lisa, they were able to detect she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted, and 2 percent angry. This software could be the begining of a whole new era. We could implament this into shools, webcams, security cameras and much more! We could use this to make more money and make people more happier in general.

I beleive if we evole this around a classroom atmostphere it could better the students of america. We could detect if a student isnt likeing a subjest, loving a subject, or just doesnt care. This program could work if we installed a camera in the fron of a classroom, Every student should be looking toward the front of the room anyways and should focus on the teacher. She could then look at the software on her computer and see if she needs to teach the material diffrently or with more inthusiasm

If she sees she is teaching something and most of the kids are unhappy, she could implement more activites change the tone of her voice, or even change the subject and come back onther day This software could be valuable for our future generation and make things easier to see what teachers need to change, or what the students should change. Overall this would benifit the shools of America and could make the educaion apect much more respectable.",1,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it helps us to define how exactly you are feeling. According to the passage it says ""In a real face or in the painted face of Mona Liza. The software can identify mixed emotions"". This technology was made by Prof. Thomas Huang, ""an expert at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate"" as said in the passage.

In my opinion i think Prof. Thomas Huang did a great job on making this project for humans and computers to communicate. Lets say if your happy, you smile to the computer this ad will pop-up and they will add another one to keep you smiling and if the next ad frowns you they will do their best to keep you smiling. The project is called Facial Action Coding System, which can detected your expression Human vs technology.

The computer detected

The Mona Liza expression, she intended to bring a smile to your face.

In conclusion these are my reasons why i think the use of this technology (FACS) to read the emotional expression of students in classroom is valuable.",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.

Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.

In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day. These our all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions.",1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0
"I don't think the ""Unmasking Face on Mars"" is true or really believable. Okay so maybe in 1976 you could sorta see a face but as the years go on, the face fades away, so how would there still be life on mars or anything on mars for that matter. For one why would you believe everything you saw on a movie, tv show, or in a magazine. People right fake stuff all the time to get more views or ratings. People crave things that aren't true.

Nobody that is human has ever lived on mars or even walked on it.

There is not any scientific proof that anything is out in outer space. If people want to believe that there is life on mars, then I guess they are just going to go into outerspace themselves and take pictures of whats really going on up there so the whole world knows. There has not been one person who has visited all the planets, so no one can really give ""facts"" or imformation about space. There is still a lot to discover and a lot more to find out. For all we know aliens could be real or unicorns.

I think the ocean and outerspace have a lot in common because, they are like worlds of unknown living things. Hopefully one day someone will be able to explore all of outerspace and give us the real imformation and prove who is right and who is wrong. Just before you start giving out imformation to people make sure you know for a fact it's true. Also we all need to do a little research about everything. We barely know our left hand. So as I end this I would like to conclude that no one in the world really has the truth on whats really out there, we don't really know if there is life on mars or if it's just a bunch of crap people feed us to take our money.",1,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,1
"Limiting car usuage is an advantage to all citizens.  All around the world people are trying pass new laws to band cars.  When people do not use their cars the world becomes less polluted, clear skies would be nice.  Also this will promote a safe lifestyle as a pedestrian. Creating people to walk everyday will be a good habit to the society.

Countries all around the world are realizing that reducing the use of cars is a big success.  "" When i had a car i always was tense.  I'm much happier this way""!  Even people love the lifestyle without their cars.  People are selling their cars and moving to Germany just to live in a place without vehicles. The people that disagree to this decison have no choice but to be fined thirty-five dollars or to be towed away.  People created a more enclosed habitat to citizens so it was not a great distance to walk to the store or even the mall.  "" In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a mainstreet,  rather than in malls along some distant highway.""  People around the United State are becoming less dependent on their cars.

Therefore, the less you use your vehicle the less populated the city will be.  The air will become clear as the car usuage lessens.  In Paris they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.  People were fined thirty-one dollars if saw on the road.  The smog creates congestion in the air.  Also as the seasons change the warmer layer of air traps car emissions.  Seeing a clear picture is more important than driving a car when it is not necessary.

In addition, banning the use of cars will improve the safety of our citizens.  Creating cities in which ""pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to improve our safety.""  Not worrying about traffic and when you can or cannot cross the street would be very meaningful to our lives.  Accidents happen everyday, most deaths come from terrible car crashes.  There are a lot of dangerous things about driving, why would we need to risk our lives?  Stay safe and walk, run and rollerblade instead of wasting your life in a car that can risk it.

In conclusion, there are many advantages of limiting car usage.  People are now considering to band vehicles which will improve the safety of citizens and make a less polluted economy. Nobody would deny the advantages of being more eco-friendly by decreasing the usage of cars. Everyone wants a safe enviroment and clear air to breathe!",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program because it can be a life changing experience. It can be a life changing experience because you can visit places,help animals as they travel over sea,and you can have fun while on the job. There are several reasons why people should join but i'll explain the major three.

My first reason why people should join the program is because you can travel to places you'll wont see everday. In the text it states that Luke said the cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small town boy. He also said he had the side benenifit of seeing Europe and China, also he said seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special.

My second reason why people should join the program is because you can help animals grow,help them stay healthy, and and get them to their destination safely. In the passage it states the animals had to be fed and watered two to three times a day. The text also states that bales of hay and bags of oats had to pulled up from the lower holds of the ship,and stalls had to be cleaned. Also the text states that Luke helping out his aunt at her farm as a boy helped prepare for hard work.

My final reason why people should join is because you can have fun to pass time. you can find things to do to keep you entertained. In the text it states that Luke also found time to have fun on board. The text states that the cowboys played baseball and vollyball games. They also had table tennis tournaments and boxing.

In conclusion joining the Seagoing Cowboy program can change your life in many ways you can care for animals and go places you will enjoy and have fun at the same time.",2,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Imagine being in a car, going to work, school, or out to eat, and not having to drive. Well many car manufacturing companies plan on releasing driverless cars in the future. While these cars are not completely driverless like they suggest, they rely on the driver only in certain situations. With these cars soon to be on the market, there are many benefits these have over regular, self-driven cars such as saved money, less reliance on the driver, and in-car entertainment systems.

A big part with any new technology, is the cost. With all these new sensors and gadgets placed on the cars, it is surely going to cost a good amount of money. However, in the long run, less accidents will be caused as these cars will know when to break and when to turn which can help save the money someone would need to repair their car.

These new cars will rely less on the driver altogether which will limit the amount of accidents as most of the accidents are due to human faults, not the car. With this new technology, the driver can sit back and let their car do most of the work, and then grab the wheel when alerted such as in a work zone or around other accidents. While the driver is waiting for their turn to drive they cannot simply just sit there and wait or they would get borded, so what would they do?

These smart cars are going to have in-car entertainment systems to keep the driver amused. When the driver needs to take over, these systems are simply turned off until it is the car's turn to drive again, something not available in phones while drivers are texting. So the driver could be watching there favorite movie or playing a game, when it is time for them to grab the wheel, it will temporarily shut off, and when they are done, they can continue watching or playing. So in a way these in-car systems are actually a safety feature in these new cars.

Some people will say that these new cars simply will not be possible due to the law. Most laws are written with the assumption that a car is being driven by a human and many states have it illegal to test computer-driven cars. However, if the states that do not have a ban on these cars test them, and they work, then other states will lift the ban and laws will be made to go along with the new cars.

New technology is produced everyday, and one day humans may not have to drive. If this is the case the benefits of this would include saved money, less reliance on a human, and in-car entertainment systems. So do not be surprised to go out on the road tomorrow and find people watching a movie and driving a car, as this new technology, is right around the corner.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Many people have different oppinions over driverless cars. Some may think that driverless cars are dangerous or just outright wrong. While some people may think that driverless car is a big step for this world, and could be very helpful. Now both groups are neither right or wrong but there are pros and cons to driverless cars. One pro is that nowadays out technology is very advanced so in driverless cars they're putting the best sensors and technology in the cars to make them as safe as possible. One

con is that these cars can handle normal driving functions but when it comes to workzones, traffic jams, or backing out of driveways they need a human to assist. I believe that driverless cars could very well help this country. Even though there are cons i think the pros out number them. So in conclusion, driverless cars may scare some but in the future these cars will be perfected and the accident rate will decrese.",1,2,0,2,1,1,2,1,2
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that Venus is a worthy planet for us to examine more closely. Venus is unihabitable and its impossible, with the technology we have today, for a human to step foot on venus. So why does the author beleive its a good idea to send humans to study this dangerous planet?

I beleive the author supports his idea that studying Venus would be a good idea very well. Although Venus is uninhabitable and dangerous for humans the author shares many solid facts that throughly support his claim. For example the author states in paragraph 4 that ""it may well once have been the most earth like planet in our solar system."" The author also shares that Venus may have once supported forms of life. I beleive these two facts alone could spark interest in the reader and get him/her to want to know more about whats on Venus. In paragraph 4 the author also states that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. I beleive this fact supports the authors claim very well. Not only does the author provide facts that sparks the readers interests he also provides logical ways and evidence of how scientists can get humans to Venus. In paragraph 5 the author says ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" meaning NASA might be able to create a vehicle that can float above all the dangers of Venus.

Despite the dangers and extreme conditions of venus the author still supports his claim with logical facts and resonable ideas. I beleive he supports his claim very well.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it is similar to Earth, the place we live. There are some similaraties of Earth and Venus, which means there could be life in Venus. If there is life at Venus and things are the same as Earth, humans could go live at planet Venus. Scientist should study Venus because they could find more similiaraties between Earth and Venus, there could have been life in Venus long ago, and We could one day live in Venus.

If scientists studied Venus they could find many more similarities. On paragraph 2 it says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance to,"" this means that Venus is pretty much Earth's twin, they have so many similarities. On paragraph 4 it mentions, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"" what this quote is saying is that not only does Venus have the same density and size but it has things that we are familiar to like mountains. These two quotes shows us we have to study Venus more to see what other similarities it has to Earth.

Scientist should study Venus to see if there has been life at Venus long ago. On paragraph 4 the author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" this means that it once was the most Earth-like planet. On paragraph 4 it also states that, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,"" this is telling us that long ago it was probably covered in water and it supported various forms of life. if there is water on the planet, there was probably life long ago.

If scientist study the planet they could find out if humans can live there or if it's to dangerous to live there. On paragraph 2 it says, ""Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for us humans to study, despite its proximity to us,"" this is telling us that going to study Venus could be very challenging. On paragraph 3 it says, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth,"" this quote is saying that it is something very extreme for humans. It might be very dangerous for us to study the planet but there could be life there.

In conclusion there could be life at Venus but it could be very dangerous to study the planet for now. We know that there could have been life at venus long ago and that it's very similar to Earth. Scientists should study Venus because they could find more similarities of Venus and Earth, there could have been life at Venus long ago, and Humans could one day live on planet venus.",3,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"I belive that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I believe that it is valuable because you can tell what a student is going through and how they really feel even if they are trying to hide it.

In the article it states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this could help teachers out a lot. If the computer can show that many students are bored or confused the teacher can see the results and help the students undersatnd more or just change the lesson plan and spend more time actually trying to help the studens instead of just making them understand something that they dont know how to do.

It could also tell you if the students is going through a hard time in their life at the time. The author states in the article ""the software can even identify mixed emotions"" so if a student gets scanned on the computer and it shows they are sad you can ask them if they want to talk about anything, or you can just be there for them to make sure that they are ok, and they they get through whatever is going on safely and not by themselves.

have to make sure the animals are healthy. Also you hav to give them watter on very hot days on borad the ship.Last you have to check on them every hour.

The first

reason luke wants people to join is to help people in need. So they can have more help and more hands to feed the animals on the journy ahead.And so there is more clothes and more aid to help injerd people.

and to help unload animals. that is the first reason people should join.

The second reason people should join is because of the great seanery. You get to play games on the way back to get more supplys.And it can open the world.It can make people aware of the suffering of other people that lost there home. And maybe lost family in the destruction that the war made.

The tird reason to join

"Dear Mr. Senator,

I am fed up with the electoral college. The system allows for so much disaster to occur. It isn't strict at all and it allows a varity of things to happen that wouldn't end well. The people deserve to make the decisions. Because the electoral college systems has so many holes and problems with it.

One of the best arguments against the electoral college is what we call the disaster factor. One big example of the disaster factor is the 2000 year election. In this election Al Gore had more votes than George Bush, but still lost by 5 votes because of the electoral college. In 1960, segregationists in Louisiana almost succeeded in replacing the democratic electors who oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded and the popular vote went to Kennedy, it would not have actually gone to Kennedy. (""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" Plumer)

Second off, one of the most worrying things is if there is a tie in the electoral vote. If that happens the election vote would be given to the House of Representatives, where the state delegations vote for the president. The vice president vote is given to the senate. Each state only casts one vote which insures that 55 million voters and 500,000 have the same power. Given the size of those numbers, and that people in those states may vote one party for president and one party for congress, the House's decision could hardly reflect on the peoples choice. We have come pretty close to this happening too, in 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted differently. (""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses are wrong"" Plumer)

There is a few reasons that opposing opioninated people use to justify wanting to keep the Electoral College around. One of them is that the president has to appeal to multiple regions. A candidate can not just be a favor of the south and get elected, he has to campaign and be desirable to all the regions. This is good because a president that was popular in just one region would not be successful, because everyone else in the other regions would feel like they do not regard their interests. Unfortuanitly this is solved by popular vote, since it is by individual not by state. Other votes in other states balance them out. (""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Poser)

The Electoral College has many reasons for it and against it. But I strongly feel that we should get rid of it for the reasons shown above. From the ""Disaster factor"" to the threat of a electoral tie. Of course other people feel differerent and have different opinions but I feel like popular vote is for the best. Thank your for taking the time to listen to my opinions.

Thank you,

"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. So weather or not theFace is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the Red Planet. However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive.",1,3,4,4,1,2,3,3,2
"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers? The author of the ''The Challenge for Exploring Venus''

supporting his idea very detail and well by descriping and comparing with others planet and how challenging it is.

First,he talked about how the Venus looks interesting and challenging, in the text its state that, ""Venus is simple to see from the distance but safe vantage point on Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"", also said its not an easy condition but survivable for human and also Venus is the closest planet to earth. But even though he said that he also state how, is state '' NASA is working and finding the best machanical and computer for to last longer in Venus and helpful to use.

Second, the author also state which is very well to support his idea it said, '' A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere''. which means that the Venus temperature and atmospheric is grater compare to our planet. He even state '' beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its suface"".

And

at the third, the author questioning to support his suggestion; ''why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?'' also he answer '' Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system''.

The statement prove that,he support his idea with details and well. The challenge must be not easy but as he said there's some people who is finding the solution and how to get better to prevent our world.",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"No one knows what the future holds and we never will.

Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, has developed something that people have always wanted to, but have never accomplished.

According to resources, Google has had cars that can drive independently, under specific conditions, since 2009.

Now, in everyone's head is ""Oh I can fall asleep behind the wheel with no worries at all"", this is not true.

Even though the car can drive itself it still gives the driver alerts to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

So with that being said, will driverless cars be around in the future?

This argumentative essay will be about the positive aspects of driverless cars because even though it has flaws, with the technology that is present today manufactuers will defientely find a way to fix every last one of them.

Almost everyday human beings come in contact with reckless drivers.

Reckless drivers are a danger to the rode, but what if sensors were put on cars to make them stop at the time they are suppose to.

Well, senors back in the 1980s could probably never do that, but now in the present they are way more advanced than ever.

Sensors detect and respond to the danger of ridiculous skids or rollovers causin the sensors to apply brakes on the individual wheels of the car and reduce the power from the engine.

This will have a better response on things than a human being driver could do by themselves.

Safety is defientely a big concern in this world so manufacturers do have to take extra precautions when making this product.

Things are still be remanufactured as the days pass, but these driverless cars are not really driverless so to speak.

Drivers will still have to pay attention to the road in case of any danger that the car can not simply do by itself.

The car does give signals like vibrating seats or annoucing over a speaker.

That might sound boring so Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW prohect manager driver, is trying to interpret the driving fun in a new way.

Some manufacturers want to discuss possible car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.

This would help with texting and driving, so with that being said this is actually a safety feature.

People purchasing the driverless vehicles have many different questions, as expected, but with the amazing progress that manufacturers are having there will be none.

Every safety hazard is put into play with making this vehicle, even the enivornment.

If they can achieve all the needs of drivers then there will be less public transportation and instead a driverless car public transportation taxi system.

Googles cars have driven more than half a milion miles without a crash which means the accident rate would certainly decrease.

With the way everything is looking, as far as safety wise, driverless cars could be a possiblity in the future.

To conclude this argument on why the world should invest in driverless cars lets go back and look at all the positive aspects.

First the sensors, then the dereasing of texting and driving rate, and last the enivornmental aspect of it all.

Automakers are continuing to solve some minor problems that occur over time as they test these babies out.

It is said that Tesla has projected a 2016 car release with the car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time.

Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to release cars by the year 2020.

Will driverless cars make a huge sucess in the future and will they stay around if they do?

We have to see what the future holds.",2,3,2,2,1,1,2,1,1
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the studies that have been done on Venus and why scientists feel those studies are so valuable to our furture.Our planet Earth provides a safe tempature and oxygen enviroment for human life. However, even though Venus and Earth are close neighbors, Venus is not safe for humans to live in. Scientists continue to learn more and more about this planet to get as much information as possible.

One of the major reasons Venus is studied so often is that it is closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. With Venus having such a thick atmosphere thats mostly made of carbon dioxide, and deadly temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, It is not able to allow any human life to remain on it. The weather on Venus also pose some issues including: volcanoes, and lightning.

Scientist have sent normerous un-maned spacecrafts to

explore Venus. With most of these trips resulting in damaged or losts spacecrafts, Astronomeres managed to learn alot about the Planets history commpanded to the way it is now and also compared to our planet Earth. This type of information can be very useful.

Astronomeres belive that long ago, Venus might not have been much different than Earth. They think that it had large oceans and could suport life. Still to this day, Venus contains a rocky surface made of sediment very similar to Earth. Along with things like valleys, mountians, and craters. The value of having a second planet safe for humans is rather large, but making the trip now is impossible due to the deadly conditions on Venus.

NASA formed an idea on how to make a safe travel to Venus that includes floating above the fray. A vehicle hovering over Venus would allow the ship to avoid the dangerous atmosphere. Despite being thirty miles above the planets surface, tempertures would still reach a boiling 170 degrees Farhrenheit. The air pressure however, is safe and livable for humans.

With alot of work and research still needed to be done on Venus, people at NASA and other companies are still striving to make life on the mysterious planet Venus possible in future years to come.",3,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The driverless cars are coming is a statement that I would not like to hear.

If there is going to be driverless cars on the road it is going to turn to a dangerous place.

If the drivers are not driving the car themselves then they are not paying attention, could cause a serious crash, and the car could malfunction.

All of these are dangerous for other drivers.

If a driver is not paying attention to the road, things can go down really fast.

Just taking your eyes off the road for a second, the car could run off the road and hit someone or just damage your car without hitting someone else.

To drive a car you need to be sure and watch where you are going because you are not just driving for yourself, you are driving for everyone on the road.

A driver must focus on the road and not anything else, or they could cause a serious crash.

Looking down to read a text message can cost a life, it may be yours or someone else.

There have been many crashes in the past year from careless drivers that do not pay attention to the road and have killed innocent families.

The alerts on the car may not work, or they may give out.

If the car was ran by technology, where does it get all of its technology?

What would happen if that technology failed?

There is always a question of what could happen or if it is going to happen.

With a driverless car, it could be a lot worse for the driver not to be driving or it could be a lot better for all the drunks that drive.

But if someone was doing something else and not watching the road, like they said the seats will vibrate if something is on the road or something wrong, if someone is not paying attention or trying to reach for something in the back they will not feel that. They could run off the road and hit something or someone.

The law has not even passed so these cars can be driven because it is a disaster to think of a driverless car driving on the road.

A part in the article even says, the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour.

There are not many roads where people will be driving 25 miles per hour.

Trying to put a car out there that can drive itself is not a good idea because there could be many problems.

With the idea of that drivers will think they will not have to drive anymore and they will not listen to the alerts and just ignore them.

They will not be focused on driving and thinking about things that really do not matter.

These cars are not safe to be driving themeselves on the road.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The wheel was the first step that took society into the making of the mobile car. Today millions of cars are made each year to help humans transport around the cities and streets around the world. Every vehicle that is powered by gasoline emits carbon dioxide, this gas is very harmful for the enviorment, it causes the ozone later to slowly dissolve and it also causes acid rains. Traffic jams is one of the many effects of having too many cars in a certain populated area. Debt has also been an influencial part in the quantity of cars around the globe. Car usage and production should be drasticly reduced to ensure a better future for all living things in the Planet Earth.

Furthermore, Global warming has slowly made its toll on Earth, most of which has been produced by the Carbon Dioxide gases in the atmosphere, this gas is a mayor green house gas. Over the years cars have been more exstensivly used and have a great percentage in world contamination, As stated in article 1 pharagraph 5 ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas emissions in europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensove areas in the united states"". This being, if car production and usage are reduced, Earth will have positive reactions to this change. The levels of global warming will also be reduced all around, this will help us conserve our north and south poles for a longer period of time, keeping safe all the animals related to that area like penguinzs and polar bears.

In addition, Traffic jams arent the most pleaseant place to be, due to the fact that they're unpredictable and in most cases highly annoying. Information from passage 2 pharagraph 14 states that ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of france"", this was due to oderly assigning days in which certain cars with certain license plates can drive through the cities of france. Less congestion means higher percent in mobility all around, this can greatly effect a 3 hour traffic jam to a simple 20 minute ride. Coming and going from places can be a brease, and this will also facilitate extra time for other potential activities. Reducing car usage and congestion can also lead to less accidents and car crashes.

Moreover, Leasing or buying a new car can come heavy on the pocket. Financial debt has been arounced ever since a currency started, debt is unpredictable sometimes and can happen to any individual. Having the latest model of a car can be a luxury only some can afford, the individuals who try and cant afford it ussually end up in debt, as reinforced in article 4 pharagraph 32 ""Cash- Strapped americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed werent going to work anyway"". Ussually some individuals ""bite more than they can chew"" and this can harm not only one indivual, but the economy as a whole. Reducing the mayor debt that can come from car leasing can improve a counrtys economy and benift milliones of individuals.

Concluding, many reasons show society to reduce the usage of cars. One being that gasoline and petrolium powered cars can contaminate the planet Earth, melt our poles, destroy the ozone layer and cause harmful weather effects. Also, the reduction of cars can lead to the de-congestion of cities in which indiviuals can more easily and freely move around adding time for them to use as they like. Lastly, the economy can have a mayor boost if car reduction and usage from leasing can occur. In conclusion, the reduction of car usage and production is a great benefit for every individual who lives on Earth, and can lead to many great outcomes that will help members of society enjoy a better life style and have a safer future.",4,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"When election day comes and you finally drop your vote in the ballet box after waiting in line for the past hour, you walk away knowing that you have helped the candidate of your choice to rise to the top of the voting pole. Oh how wrong you are. The United States works on a voting system called the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Plumer 10). This system has stood the test of time, however it has masked its flaws for long enough. ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (Plumer 9). The people have spoken, now it is time to break down the logistics...

In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. The founding fathers reasons for forging this system where justified in their day and age. However the world has changed since then. These days education is standard and people have enough sense to know what each candidate has to offer, and who can guide our country to prosperity. If United States citizens are well educated, then why leave this barrier up?

Another large issue with the electoral college is its favoritism towards larger states. The United States was founded on federalism and democracy, giving power to the people instead of an over-arching central government ruling everything. So any policy that goes against our right to equal say in politics ought to be abbolished, right? The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. ""... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators..."" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom.

If the Electoral College does not seem like a flawed system now, allow me to open your eyes to one last variable in our little Electoral equation. The disaster factor. The disaster factor deals with the will of the people, and them doing anything to get what they want. ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that the popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy.)"" (Plumer 11). That kind of scenario could completely change a close call to a landslide victory! The 1960 election is not the only case of this either. It happened again when Hawaii sent two slates of electors to congress, and in other various cases electors did not vote for their designated candidate. Finally there is the case of the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College! If just one person decides to go against the grain, everything gets thrown off.

Case and point, the Electoral College is a flawed system. People are educated and can make a smart choice for a president, everyone deserves fair say in the political world, and people need to open their eyes to the corruption that the Electoral College allows for. It may have made sense back in the day of the founding fathers, but it is time to move on and adopt the popular vote system that the people have asked for.",4,4,3,3,1,1,2,3,2
"Senador first I want to say that I dissagree with the idea of the Electoral college becouse the people needs vote for the president that they want""that's democrastic"". One of the reasons is that the Electoral College is unfair,outdated and irrational. The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachorsims,not democratic method of selecting a president that ought to oberruled by declaring the candidate who recieve the most popular votes the winners. Its entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the nation popular vote. There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible ,but it's possible,but it's likely that a disputate over the popular vote. Other is that the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in wich no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast.

Smog levels have risen substancially and it shows, but there are more and more solutions that are begining to show.

germany definitely has the right approach here. they live in what is pretty much a car free society. in a one square mile city of 5500 people, 70% of them do not have cars. everything in that city is within walking or biking distance so there is no need for one. having a society like this is also very stress relieving in a sense. you no longer have the every day stress of being on a highway or constantly alert for cars, a society like this is for the most part more laid back then a regular one. the amount of exercise is also increased here because you are walking or biking everywhere, you are constantly moving. it is something that every country should take into consideration. the long term effects of pollution will be detremental to our world and we know that. now is our time to fix that.

tail pipe emission accounts for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in europe and up to 50% in dense cities in the United States. and after near record breaking pollution in just a matter of days, paris decided to put a partial ban on driving. by doing this congestion in the city was down 60%, and by doing this the smog cleared relatively quickly. in this short amount of time that driving was partially banned we were able to see a large decrease in not only pollution but the amount of congestion in a city. not only does this make everyday life safer for every day citizens but improves the living quality of all people by making the air and world cleaner. projects like this are showing multiple benefits and great long term affects, not only for car drivers but for pedestrians that are walking the streets to, if congestion in a busy city is down by that much it makes getting around a lot easier for someone who walks/bikes/or runs eveerywhere. i think its crucial for people to understand the upsides to having societies like this. grnated it will be hard to adjust to but the upsides to it will outwiegh the cons in the long run.

a big thing to look at here in one of the benefits of having a car free society like this is not just the pollution but the exercise rate. as americans we are without a doubt an overweight country and thats obvious. what having something like this would do for us is incredible. even if it was a one day thing to try like Bogota, Colombia. once a year everyday they have what is called a ""car free day"" where everyone in the city is restricted from using cars unless it is a taxi or transit. this now enforces or allows if you will, everyone to ride a bike, skate, run, or walk to their destination. the streets are left practically empty. when you also do this you can bring improvements to your community. Bogota went from a cracked unevenly paved sidewalk to the replacement of smooth broad and even sidewalks. parks and sport centers have increased and blossomed all throughout the city, and you see the community just start to come together as a whole.

Now with all this being said there obviously are still downsides to cutting out gas producing cars. weather being a main one. suppose it rains one day, how do you get to work? not only that but in warmer climates if you have to go a longer distance to get to your job it gets hot and if you are in your suit and tie you're going to be sweating. if you are a blue collar worker, you have equipment that you have to keep on you at all times not having a vehicle will restrict that. not being able to drive will also slow down many buisnesses that travel to someones home such as a lawn service or a plumber. if you work out of town how do you get to your job? people would have to leave their families and move closer to their workplace if they worked out of town or quit their job. there is a lot to take into consideration when you think about all the possibilities of creating a society like this. and the only way this could work is if it was incorporated the same way that it was for Vauban germany. if you had a one square mile society where everything was walking distance and your job was in the area then i believe it would be extremely beneficial, but areas like that are few and far between and making areas like that would change the geography of the entire country.

by no means are we as a country (America) ready to change to this kind of society any time soon, but i do think that in due time we can benefit from this in a huge way. but there is a lot that has to change and our nation as a whole has to be willing to conform to this. there would be a substancial amount of change in this nation if this were to happen and we as a country are not one that necessarily likes change. we like our two car white pickett fence houses and cutting that out of everyones lives would no go over well with the majority of Americans. this is something that the future of America needs to seriously take into consideration. its appearant that we are destroying our world every single day and we are one of the main contributors. this is our chance to help ourselves and the generation to come, but are we willing to conform and put our luxiories aside for the greater good of mankind?",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Dear State Senator , I wrote this letter to you to talk about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. My opinion on this intriguing subject is that we should keep the Electoral Collge , my reasons being that voting by a popular vote can sometimes go wrong and we avoid the Run-Off Elections. When its time to pick a new president very few people research about this president and his slate of electors , they just vote for the most apealling to them , the one that is always out and doing meetings, or brunches , or just having a perfect day with their family . People that research or dig deep to find out who they are really voting for .

Let me start by saying that the ones whom created the Electoral College , where our founding fathers , these men are thought as wise and caring for their country. The reason stated why the Electoral College should be kept because popular voting can go wrong. Yes the popular vote of the Electoral College its worth but maybe not that much.  In Defense of the Electoral College : Five reasons to keep our depised method of choosing the President , it states that "" But each party...win the national popular vote""(source 3).  Posner is stating that each party picks their electors to be trustworthy , not someone who would do dirty work behind their backs. People go out and vote for our next president and see them running our country , but sometimes people vote for a president for the reasons being that they just want to vote . Its not like the lines outside are not long enough for a person to just go into the voting booth and pick a random president and just leave. People dont actually look behind, search for whom they are votting for .Thats why the Electoral College shouldnt be ruled out , the Electoral College is actually helping out more then we thought. When we least expect it we have a crazy wako running our country , then that would be the time when the people would Notice that they made a huge mistake .

Run-Off elections , sounds like a tedious process. When Run-Off elections occur some people get annoyed , why its a longer process . We get a little bit delayed on finding out on whom the president of the United States is going to be . People want to know who going to be the next president of their country , whos going to try to fix the small little problems the last president left . THose are mainly alll the questions these voters ask. In The Indefensible Electoral College :Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system  are wrong , Bradford states "" At the most basic level...in the ""swing"" states"" (source 2). Bradford claims that the candidates dont spend much time in states that they know wont get plenty of votes. Well true but why would they both of theses candidates are running for president they need to get as many votes they can if they are bad or good . Even though we are technically not being fair with theses states why because the candidiates arent paying so much of the their attention and aren't caring for those states votes . This country runs off on what the people want but sometimes are the people being fair?.

Keeping the Electoral College can be a really good thing do to the fact there are people that do know about choosing a president .It's been stated before that some people dont care at all who the next president is, as lonmg as they fix their problems and they have jobs, and good medicare they are perfectly fine who the president is . The Electoral College is like a helping hand .",3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The face the newset discovery by NASA a huge rock formation that looks very simllar to humans face and is one of the biggest thing NASA seen yet. This face has been causeing a big argument about life on mars and that alien made the face but im here to prove it wrong. This argument is just crazy alien life haha impossible and im here to tell you why their no alien life on mars and that just a rock formation. Now here are my three facts that will surely bring you to resaon noththing but shadows, no aliens found, all clear these will prove im right

The rock fomation know as the face on mars is nothing its just shadow turning the rock to a face when you look or take a photo from far away. This face is just a rock the only reason its look like a face because of shadows from far away the may seem like a face because the shadow give features like eyes, noes, and a mouth. This would maake any one that not looking very close think it looks like a face

On april,5,1998 michael malin and the mars ordbiter camera went to to cydoia to slove this problem once and for all. When he arrived he took the camera and document his time their makeing sure he got pictures of everywhere he went. when he csme back they took the photos and reseach them and found no traces of alien life forms. With this info they were able to show to the media that their aliens makeing rock faces on mars.

It was about about a couple mouths untill the media wanted more info to really prove that it was just a rock formation. So NASA inhase their ordbiter camera and took it back to cydoia. as they took more pictures with a better camera with maximum resoluiton to get a better shot of the planet they can fanliiy prove 100% that their are no alien or sturuces on mars

With this NASA was able to prove it's just rock formation like any rock formation on earth. Now i hope you can understand why its just that a bunch of rocks that was given human features because of the shadows. that not only once but twice they took pictures showing that their are no aliens on mars or anywhere. Hopefully you could really see why and still say they could have miss it you are sadly mistaken they gave a clean sweep around the plant showing no structes or life forms",3,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0

"The author emphasis how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is very important to Astronomers. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mainly supports how Venus is worth the riskand challenge to explore to see if it's as much like Earth as it's said to be, because it is close to Earth in size and density, has similiar geographics, and is known as Earth's sister planet.

First, Venus is set up with similar distancing as Earth it's sometimes often referred to as ""Earth's twin"". The text says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is so similar to Earth, but yet so challenging to explore.

Second, just like Earth Venus has mountains and valleys. Some might even say long ago there were oceans, because the text says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth.""

Then, Venus is known to be Earth's sister planet! Venus has always been the closest planet to Earth other than Mars, but if Venus is so much like Earth astronomers can't figure out why it's so much more inhospitable than Earth.

In conclusion, Venus is a very challenging place to see and be. Venus has not been touched in more than 30 years! In the text it says "".. not a singlr spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" So although Venus is the sister of Earth astronomers know very little about her. So they keep in pursuit to learn more despite the dangers it presents everytime.",2,2,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Using technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in a classroom is not a good idea.

The FACS enables computers to read human emtions such as sad, happy, scared etc.

It uses a 3-D comoutuer model of the face and and the 44 major muscles to read your emtions.

Using the FACS in a classroom is not a good idea becuase it can cause distraction, limit human contact, and limit the amount of one on one time a teacher has to help the students.

The FACS should not be used in the classroom becasue it could cause distractions for the students.

The students could be more focused on what the computer says than what the teacher is teaching.

If the FACS breaks down then a student could feel left out and sad and that could distract them from performing their best in school.

The computer could also allow students to get off task and only focus on what is happening on the computer, or if the FACS is built into a regular laptop it could cause students to play games or do other things on the internet than learn in the class.

The FACS can be very distracting to students so they sould not be found in the classroom.

In school we meet new friends, bond with teachers and have human contact all day long.

If the FACS is in the classroom it could cause all of that to disapear.

This means that teachers could become less engaed with the class and students can become less engaed with learning.

Dr Huang states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inculding emtional communication"".

COmputers do not have emtions like huamns do.

The computer may be able to tell how we are feeling but they can not make us feel better if we are sad, or scared, or in destress.

This can cause students to feel more isolated and make them more sad, or scared etc.

When students feel this way it could ause more school violence.

FACS should not be in the classroom.

The third and final reason that the FACS should not be in the classroom is because it can limit the teachers one on one interaction with students.

Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

Teachers are there to teach to interact with the students and sense if they are confused.

If the FACS does that for them and helps the student if they are confused then the teacher is not there to help the student.

This could also cause the student to be more confused if the computer is teaching them instead of a real life teacher.

FACS should not be in the classroom because it will limit the contact between student and teacher.

The FACS is an amazing innovation, but it should not be found in the classroom.

It should not be allowed in the classroom becuase it can be a distraction to students, limit human contact. and limit the amount of one on one time a teacher can have with a student.

It is important that school is a place to interact with others and futher your education but having a computer read your emtions in class will damage the school experience.

Therefore the FACS should be found in the classroom.",2,1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1
"Venus is a strange planet, not only seen as a strange planet but also as a risky, planet in which scientists and researchers are trying to land on.

The fact that the author say that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger is because venus is the closest planet to earth, so it may contains some news and important things that scientist or human haven't discovered yet,and for the fact that venus is the closest planet to earth make people get excited to visit it,

(also contains analogous things), the fact that visiting venus is also a despite danger is because venus is the hottest planet in the world with a temperature of 800 degrees.Which a kind of this amount of temperature can cause erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent litghting strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface.

one thing is sure, venus is one of the challenging and difficult thing for scientist or researchers

to study and know about,for the reason that they are not allowed to bring samples of rock, gas, or anything else there(in venus), cause it can cause serious damage. but also a planet that contains important information especially for scientist and may add a big importance to the science and the study of the earth.

"The new technology theses people are wotking on is an outstanding acheivment and will help to improve our education. This technology could be very useful in other situations that require the information this technology can give. Technology of this type is something that could change the way we do certain things in life.

Facial Action Coding System can be very useful in our education system today. In this age we have a good education system but can be improved in so many ways. The FACS can see what we feel by looking atr our faces, so that would allow the student to have a different lesson whether it be more or less difficult to allow him/her to learn at a much better pace than previously. The article states that the FACS can set up a new lesson for the student who is either bored or stressed, this only proves my point further that it would be of great value for our education system today.

The FACS system can be introduced to many lines of work other than our education system. In confrences with people with problems in their live a certain word can trigger an emotion, the FACS system would be able to tell his/her emotion and properly calm him/her down. The FACS system is and amazing feat and even become a great asset to interrogation such as whether or not using fear on a person actually works or if the interrigated person is lying about their emotion.

FACS is a wonderful technological invention that could change many things in our day to day life. This system can help jobs become easier and could very well reduce the amount of suicides by helping people get the help they need. The FACS can make our life so much better and could be effective on therapy and other jobs in that line of work.

Overall the FACS system is revolutionary and we should adopt it into our lives. With the FACS system our lives could change for the better and allow a new dawn to begin. Once the FACS system is in our lives it can be updated on the way we hide our emotions and keep up with the different tactics of concealment and deception to allow a more perfect system made out of the origional. FACS is truly and outstanding acheivment that must be used in our lives.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,1
"i think it's pretty much safe for stop driving cars or give them away,and it making people looking bad in sense to .given your cars away will reduicing accidents more people will feeling safe when they walking in the streets and more parents will let their kids playing in the streets without asitated and the air will be good and everyone breath very well and more people will stop getting ticket from police.

taking some one 's cars away will hurt some people 's feeling and this idea sound good to me because some teenagers keep making some fast cars and racing in the streets and there  is some time most of them got their self killed or burning a life in the car if they can especially take those cars away it will be more safeand tey will stop dying in cars accident.

"As a scientis of the NASA which is a space agency disscussing the Face on Mars, I dont believe nor think that it was created by aliens I mean how could it possibly be they say that it was just a normal landform and which I believe in because there were no aliens then.

Not evryone was satisfied with what they heard so there was more research on the Face of Mars skeptics said that there were alien markings left hiddin by haze. The controllers were curious so they decided to look over it again just to be sure, it wasn't easy to target it the Cydonia it was very hard to actually do it the Surveyor was a mapping of the spacecraft and it usually looked straight down and it scaned the plant.

After they scaned on April 8th the Malins team saw an unexpected photo, they had to look very close enough they rolled they're spacecraft 25 degress to the center and each of the pixels were 1.56 meters, and was just like the 43 meters.

It came to the end is that it was landforms that were most likely common in the American West and the "" Face on Mars"" actuaclly showed butte or mesa.

"I believe that the Facial Coding System has a valuable future. With the coding system being able to read emotions almost aswell as we humans can, the system may be incorprated into security systems and schools. The Facial Coding System could advice teachers if students are bored or tired as stated in paragraph 6 ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Having a system that could do that would improve the teachers teaching skills for a more fun way of teaching rather than the old monitione lectures. The Facial Coding System can improve the lesson, like an effective human insructor.

If the Facial coding System becomes a valuable System in schoold it could not just improve students educatin but reduce the amounts of absent kids per year. Due to a more enjoyable education kids wouldn't miss out as much as they do. If The Facial Action Codig System is in computers students will more thn likely look up at their screens than their phones. Computers will aslo have to understand that most humans communication is nonverbal as stated by Dr. Huang. This leading to the system needing minor adjustments before a succesful future.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System is a valuable system and has many possibilities of being used for schools and for various purposes. Not only is the system valuable, it gives others an acknowledgment of how you feel and in how many ways they can help. If you feel upset for any reason anyone could now help by the press of a button. The system will have a future and a wide arrange of features if given time for deveopers, to where is can even mak more expressions for videos game faces and more.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"NASA recently discovered an unusal landmark, on Mars. According to the text NASA discovered the landmark in 1976, and they weren't sure why the landmark was shaped how it was, a face. This shows that many people had many questions and disbelief of what NASA had been telling the public. This proves that many people where arguing that NASA was not being truthful about what they have discovered. Therefore, people where getting angry with NASA.

NASA was telling the truth, it was just an landmark. Many citizens thought it was a sign of intellignece life, and didn't believe what NASA was telling them. NASA was excited about this discovery, and wanted everyone to know. They didn't hide anything, there still was not any prove of intelligence life on Mars. NASA was saying, that if they found intelligence life, they would tell the whole world. They wouldn't try to hide such a mind blowing discovery.

Even though NASA was telling the truth about everything they have discovered, and told the public that if they found life on Mars, they would tell the whole world, that isn't something they would hide. The public still wasn't convinced. NASA would love to discover life on Mars. They sent more robots over to Mars to get better images, with better pixels, so they could get closer and see if there were huts and any other landmarks. NASA said they would never hide something so big, and important from the public or the world.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy but risky pursuit because there are as many precautions as there are benifits. For example, the author states in paragraph 5, ""Not easy conditions, but surviable for humans."" Venus is one of the most earth like planets in our solar system. There are many people researching and finding new things about Venus and our solar system.

Venus has a very thick atmosphere. There is only about 3 percent oxygen and about 97 percent carbon dioxide. This is a huge hazard considering earth has near the exact opposite. getting to close to this planet can be very dangerous because the average tempeture on the surface is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

"Is the Electoral College a good thing? A Majority would say no and that it is a non democratic method of selecting a president. Many believe this system should be changed, as it is not really an accurate way to show what the majority wants, and that the president of the united states should be chosen through the popular vote. What if there is a tie in the electoral vote? In the case of a tie the election would be given to the house of represenatives. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for congress, this isn't really and accurate reflection of the will of the people.

The electoral college is a system that has voters vote for a slate of electors, not the president. If you lived in california, for example, and voted democrat, you actually voted for a slate of Democratic electors pledged to the Democratic party. These electors, if they won the statewide election, would then go to congress and the Democrat candidate would recieve the vote of these electors. Anyone not holding public office can be an elector. And it depends on the state on how they are picked. Sometimes the presidential candidates themselves choose who the electors are. Voters can't always control who the electors end up voting for.

Of course the electoral college method has its upsides. Being that with this system in place the outcome of the election is more certain. Of Course a dispute over the outcome is possible, it did happen in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. However, it can be argued that this method can turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, Democrats in Texas for example, or Republicans in California. These voters, knowing their vote will have little to no effect, would have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would if the president was chosen through the popular vote.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Most states have a winner-take-all system in place. Which means that they award the winning presidential candidate all of the electors votes. Because of this candidates dont spend time in states they have no chance of winning. They choose to mainly focus on the undecided states. In some cases, states don't get to see the candidates at all during the campaign, or even a single campaign ad.

In short, Does the electoral college work? In some ways yes but in many ways no. The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The electoral college should be abolished, and the decision of who becomes  president should be left to the popular vote; seeing as it is a more accurate representation of the collective will of the people.",3,4,3,3,2,2,2,2,2

"There are very many pros & cons on why ""Driverless Cars"" would be a good thing.

I can name a lot of good and bad things about them. I am here to tell you my position, & to tell you pros & cons on this situation. These things can be very helpful in deciding whether these cars are a idea or not. Everybody may have different opinions on this situation.

Personally I think driverless cars could be good & bad. Here's why. Driverless cars could benefit a lot of people in many ways , for example if you are running late and you dont have time to do something before you leave the house you can do it in the car. On the other hand its a bad thing because they say the car tell you when it needs human assistance, but what if you're so busy doing the thing you were doing while you were runnning late you don't pay attention to the car telling you it needs your assistance. So before you know it you end up in a accident.

Some people think that the car isnt a good idea. They believe that ""the only safe car is the one that has a human driver in control at all times"". I see why they would think that . Considering the fact that all of this is running off of technology, who's to say that something horrible is going to happen. Technology malfunctions all the time , so what makes people think that these driverless cars are any different. So there's a problem with a car running off of technology. They say that they plan to have these problems solved , & a handful of car companies plan to have cars that drive by themselves in a few years, but they get closer to where they want to be with this everyday.

Thats how I feel on the situation of driverless/smart cars. Until they get all the problems under control & get everything to the point where no one has to wonder about what would happen in a certain situation, I think that they are a bad idea. They have good reasoning on why they should be made but the list of why they shouldnt overshines that.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"The"" Face on Mars "",this was a therory that even scientist couldn't figure out until 2001. The space probs most liikely sent false information that made them belive that it was a face, when in reality it was just a huge rock formation. Also, in the place that this site was located they are to belive that these things are common in this area. It was the shadows of the rock formation that gave off the belief to be a human face in the rock formation.

NASA states that new high resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is : A mesa. Also, it says that another group of people went to Mars and as soon as they could get a photo of it the the minute that they could.When they put it on the website there were already thousands of anxious web surfers waiting ,so when the image appeared they could identify it as a natural landform and there was no alien monument after all.

Even though they came to a conclusion many people still had doubts about it, so they prepared to look again. They said it's not easy to target Cydonia, so Mars Global Surveyor drew

in closer to the surface and luckly enough it wa not an alien monument.These facts state that there were no aliens on Mars because aliens are not real and they most likely will never be.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear Senator,

I feel as if you should keep the Electoral College as it is. Our country is so messed up that we have a lot of our people not working or just getting well-fair. To be honest, that isnt fair that they get a vote. Who are they going to choose when it comes to voting? Someone trying to help us move forward or someone making our tax money got to the people who dont want to get off there lazy butt and do something. I do not know 100% of the facts on who can vote or not, but if a bum sitting on state road 70 all day begging for money just so he can go buy beer, seems unfair that he should even get a vote. In my opinion half of the population will end up voting for someone because, of what bad benefits he is offering and then we will be stuck with another bad president for another 4 years! Who knows more about congress then our congress? Lets be a honest here, do we really want all our tax money going to families with 8 kids and cant afford 2 or the bums on the side of the road begging for money or the trashy people hitting up crack ever time they get a little bit of money? Not me!

The article states that yes the electors may choose differently from what the people and the popularity wanted. I dont think that matters because why would they vote for someone who isnt fit to be president? If they are even up there, they are fit. So I think the Electoral College is just fine of a process to use for the United States of America. Yes, maybe our electors dont see certain benefits one canidate might be offering or doesnt understand as to why one might be better in your eyes. But in the end, the president we choose is probably not even going to actually do half the things he promised so who cares?

If we want this country to go anywere we need to let the people who actually understand what the men up on the campains telling the people of america a bunch of lies really offer us. They know whats good for us and thats why they are voting for them.

I hope you understand where I am coming from.

"Do you think that our world should have driverless cars ? Well I don't think that we should have driverless cars. I think that more car accidents will occur. How safe would the car be around people. Thats my opinion on why driverless cars shouldn't be made.

My opinion is more accidents will happen if we had driverless cars. One reason why accidents would happen is due to technololgy failure, and if the car did get into an accident and severly hurt someone whos fault would it be the humans fault, or the cars fault.

Would the driverless car be safe around peope? How safe would a kid be walking home from school and a driverless car is coming down the street? Would the car be able to recongnize a kid and stop at an apropriate distance without getting in the red zone of a kid ? These questions are important questions that need to be taken into consideration heavly.Thats one reason why I disagree with having driverless cars roming the earth.

I highily disagree with having driveless cars because what if the driveless car gets into an accident would that be the cars fault or the fumans fault? How safe would the car be driving around humans ? Would it be able to stop at an apropriate distance with out hurting anyon? These questions need answers out of the saftey of everyone.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Luke's life changed after high school graduation because of a friend named Don Reist invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. And luke went cause he couldn't say no. It was and oppertunity of a life time to him. So he did travel to Europe. Before then Luke had two part-time jobs in agrocery store and a bank when Don Reist invited hom to go to Europe on a cattle boat.

Many countries were left in ruins no food no supplies for them to live off of. So 44 nations joined together to form UNRRA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration). Hired,""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the young cows and the mules that were going over the sea. Luke and Don signed up for the ""Seagoing Cowboys."" To help the countrys that were left in ruins because they needed food to survive. And Luke signed up and he said it was awsome to help the countrys that were in need of food and shelter. The seagoing cowboys traveled far across the sea to help countrys in need, they even went to China, and it took a month to get there. Luke had fun being a seagoing cowboy.

It took 2 weeks to get to the United States, and a month to get to China. Carrying animals during the crossings kept luke busy. But Luke was ready because helping out at aunt Katies farm prepared him for the journey ahead. On Lukes second trip Luke served as a night watchman. And he cracked his ribs sliding down the stairs. but Luke also found fun things on the board they did baseball, volleyball, table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games helped pass the time. being a seagoing cowboy was more of than a adventure to Luke Bomberger a world was opened to him. Luke was grateful for the oppertunity of being a seagoing cowboy, and the awreness stayed with him, while leading his family a number of of international students and exchange visitors for many years.",0,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0
"Technology that can read your face? Wow, isn't that amazing! I've never heard of anything like it, and i thought no one would ever make anything like this! Also to try and ues it on a classroom of kids? Amazing! To create such technology had to have been super difficult. Although, it didn't seem so impossible for Porf. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, the creators of the Facial Action Coding System, to create such an amazing computer system!

While reading this artical I thought to myself, ""I wonder what it would be like to try and use this technology to read my peers emotions when I ask them if they are okay?"", when I ask them I usually grt the sholder shrug, a sigh, or they just don't answer. But to use this technology and get an answer to the question I ask almost on a daily basis, would be amazing! I bet the teachers would love it too, because they could tell if the students really felt on a lesson, or if they just don't care enough to pay attention to what the teacher is saying.

Also if we could use this technology say, for example, two students get into a fight and neither one of them will tell how they feel about the situation, we could just use this to read how they feel, then adress the sitiation the way it needs to be. The technology could also be used for things such as theropy, for those who really don't know how to describe their feelings, or just want to be left alone to think. It could also help with seeing how people feel about diffrent situations, and they just don't want to speak up. Or if a student is getting bullied, and they don't want to talk about how they feel about it, read their face.

This new technology could be a great thing for the future. Using it to try and understand how students feel is a good thing. But also I do feel students have a choice, a choice that means if they want to have their face's read or not. If the student doesn't want their face to be read, then so be it. If the student is willing to have their face read, then so be it.

In conclusion to this essay, I find it amazing how Prof. Huang and Prof. Sebe were able to create something as amzaing as this! Jus t being able to read the face of a human is hard for people to do, but now with this new technology, we can do so much! Because a picture, in this case a face, can say a thousand words. And we can add even more words to the statement with the new Facial Action Coding System.",2,2,1,3,0,1,1,1,1
"I think you should do the seagoing program because, you get to ride waves.

If I were you I would make my own choice not my friends choice or someone elses choice. When you are doing the seagoing cowboy program you get to go out and ride waves and play games at night time.

Another reason you should go is because you can learn things about the sea and the animals in it. If you already know a lot of things about the animals in the sea and the sea you should still go, because you can learn more and have fun at the same time. In the story it said "" Luke got to play games at night and he got a lot of time during the day to go wave riding"".

If you don't go on the Cowboys program I can't even tell you what your missing out on. I understand if you don't wan't to go, trust me I probably wouldn't it's not like I'm allowed to go anyway. I woud rather stay home than being homesick so I totally understand if you don't want to go.

If you don't want to go, but one of your friends are going or you don't want to go and someone is convincing you to just take some time to think about it and then make your second decision. Just remember do what you want to do, not what someone else wants to do.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,1
"Technology have go further, we have technology everywhere, from cameras to Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The FACS is a software that can read your emotions, it reads the muscles of your face, it creates a 3-D computer model of the face and reads the 44 major muscles in the face, the software can classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The FACS can be used in schools but it can have controversial problems, because some parents may not want a computer to read their childrens emotions, or they can think that is not a good thing that a computer can read your face and later they can use the picture of the face for other things, but some other parents may like the idea of using FACS in the school because they can know how their kids are feeling.

The pros about using that technology is that they can save the data and compare of how the students are feeling in the classroom and change the way of teaching, that can help the kids to not feel bored in class and they can enjoy it, other pro is that parents can see how their children are feeling and they can talk with them if they have issues or something is happen with their life and they don't want to tell them, in the article Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

The cons might be that the the parents may not like the idea that a computer is reading the emotions of their kids, and the other con is they will not want to change the way of teaching because a computer said that the kids are bored or confuse, they might blame the teacher for not teaching the right way.

At my point of view is a good idea to use the FACS in the shools because the kids will not get bored if the school change the way of teaching and they will enjoy it, the other thing I like about the FACS is that the parents can know how their kids are feeling and they can talk with them, they can have more time together and be in time with the family, but now is your turn to decide what idea you like the most, you are with the pros or cons.",2,3,1,3,0,0,0,1,0
"In the stories and beyond, The Face is classified as one of aliens artifacts. As a scienctist this peice of information is to be told unreal. Some of NASA has worked on many prodjects to find ths true and has gone across a couple of points. Most have began to say they wished there was an acient civilazation on Mars. In part of the discussion this evidence is told false as well, some workers there have shown that this is known to be a anatural landform on the planet which created during different phases in the weather. A team of Global Surveyor has flew over to tell that there was no known pictures/image of an alien monument. In conclusion, the story was very fictional there was no evidence on known alien only something else. It also made more since if was only peices of rocks that has collided together to form this image which would be a good topic to use.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1976 there was a mysterious face found on the planet Mars. I'm a scientist at NASA space station discussing some accusations about this face. Some people are beginning to believe that the face was created by aliens. However, that is not the case here. This mysterious face was simply created by natural causes and happens to just have distinct features of a human face.

My first reason as to why this face is a natural landform is because there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed on Mars, or anywhere else. If there is no proof of these aliens living then how could they have possibly been able to create such an artifact. Plus, believing that this was caused by natural causes is way more believable then relying on unproven research that aliens once existed.

My second reason to this being just a natural landform is scientists believe the nose,eyes, and mouth of the figure are created by shadows giving it an illusion of a human face. This attracted the public which is exactly what NASA wants. So, NASA is using the illusion of this human face to attract more attention to their program and Mars itself. By doing this it is making most people believe the face was created by aliens, which it in fact wasn't. Evidence of this is when the article, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.""

My third and final reason this mysterious face is just a natural landform is that is resembles features of landforms common in American West. For example, Garvin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars,"" Garvin also says. If this face resembles American Western landforms so much then it must be a natural landform itself.

Although there are reasons this face wasn't created by aliens there are some conspiracies involving NASA. One is that people believe NASA has already found traces of life on Mars and would rather keep that sceret from the public. This is believable because NASA wouldn't want to alarm the public of extraterrestrial lifeforms and create panic. Although it could create panic, NASA should want to inform the public because it could cause support of NASA and thier findings instead. For example, people could start donating money to the company to help with further research and have more knowledge about what they do.

This mysterious face on the surface of Mars is no more than a natural landform. It was not caused by aliens because there is no scientific proof. NASA wants the public to believe it is a cause by aliens so they could get more publicity for it. I mean, this face has already starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. It's had enough publicity and does not deserve anymore because of the fact that it is just a natural landform caused by natural changes, not aliens.",4,3,2,2,1,2,1,2,2
"What has the world come to? Technology is improving each and every day. People are comming up with new inventions such as: iwatches, wireless headphones, and many more amazing gadgets. It crazy how much the world relies on technology now and days. For the most, part people use technology everywheer they go. In the artical, ""Driverless Cars Are Comming"" , it states pros amd cons of having this invention. I believe that driverless cars can be dangerous! It can also lead to more car accidents. With the driverless cars humans would have no control over the car. This comes to show that the developement of these cars would not be safe for the people across the world.

The idea of driverless cars would not be safe because people would not pay attention to the roads as much. As stated in the article, ""This means the human river must remain alert and be ready to take over when this situation occurs."" This specific quote shows that driverless cars can be extremely dangerous. People in the drivers seat would have to be alert at all times. Sometimes, people are doing other things in the drivers seat such as: falling asleep, on the phone, or just completely not paying attention to the road. These things that were just listed are some of the main reason why there are so many car accidents that occur on the side of the road.

In reality, there are certain laws that apply when people are driving. ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best avhieved with alert drivers."" This quote comes to further prove my point that the idea of driverless cars would not be a good thing. The passage also says, ""in most states is is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" It is illegal for inventions like driverless cars to be tested. So ... What's the point ? ""Why would anyone want a driveerless car that still needs a driver?""

This evidence comes to show that driverless car are not neccessary in the world and would just cause more problems.

In conclusion, the negative aspects presented in this passage further prove that driverless cars are not safe and are useless if a person is still need in the car just in case.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Think,what would you purfur a car you drive yourself or one where you just sit back and watch it drive itself? In all hobnestly I purfer to have a car I can drive myself, so therefore I'm a hundred perecent against driveless cars. Driveless cars are not as goos as they maqke them out to be and I am here to say why.

If you can not drve the car yourself,then what's the point of having the drivers lisences you worked so hard to get? Think about if you no longer having a car you drive on your own your lisence will no longer mean nothig,but a card with your picture and your life information on it. Therefore you will intend to forget it at home and what if something does happen and you do not have your lisence on you then the wreck or whatever happned will be no longer pointing out to be the cars fault it all of sudden is yours because you do not have the lisence you thought you did not need, because you thought your driveless car could handle driving.

What if you're just driving down the road and the technology to the car stops working? think the technology stops working and you have no idea how to run the car so you're stuck in trafic you have no where to. SO you have to call atow truck and a cab so there's money you have to spend because they said drivles cars were better.

"In my opinion, I'm against driveless car and I believe that it is not safe for us. Driverless car still have a long way to go; none of the driveless car that are invented today are ready to be tested in the real world. We have car that we used in today world and theres no problem with it. There are no reason why we need Driveless car.

First, how can we trust driveless car or the company creating these car? They are so useless and we dont need it. I know it sound cool ""self driving car"" but, how can we trust these companies makeing these car. Most of the comany that sell car are money maker. According to the ""Drivelss Cars are Comming"" in paragraph nine the author stated ""If the techonology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" What if you are invloved in accident and none of it was your fault, and they chager you for it.

Futhermore, We should all be concered about this, and my big concered is how much these Driveless car cost? What if it cost like million of dollar to own these car. Then it would be useless and a wastefull of money. In the text it also stated that the car can only handle 25 mph, and the human have to keep hold of the wheel. What the point of riding the driveless car, if you have to keep hold of the wheel. In the rest of paragraph 7 it talks about the human must stay alert and be ready to over take any danger situation. Coumpter car are not really safe there could be a smart hacker and takes contorol of your car. How will we react to a hacker and who would be responblie for it if we got invovel in a carsh?

On the other hand, Most of the company like Mercedes-Benz, audi, and Nissan plan to have car that can drive by themselves by 2020. As times goes on coumpter will drive our own car and ruled over us. We have to be aweard of what is happening. Most of us are not even sure what self driving car exactly is and never been on self drving car before. For me, I think I dont need self driving car I got my own hand and I can drive my self as safe as I wanted to be.

In conclusion, I hope in the near future there will be no consequencey with self driving car. Years 2020, is not a long way before you know it everyone could ride selfdriving car. Coumpter will contorol the car and we put our saftey in their hand. We will have to turst the coumpter that it is safe to ride the self driving coumpter car.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0

Even that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds these diferences in speed mean that somtimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus is because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this could draped world where we the humans live whith all familiers and sharing good ideas each other with friends, witgh families, and neighbor.

"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author desribes how a new technology, named the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) , makes it possible for a computer to ""calculate"" our emotions. The first subject that this was tested on was Mona Lisa. You might be thinking, but that's a painting how could that be done. To that I say, that is how well it performs. It is so good it can tell in paintings. Think about it, facial reconization systems are already made. Now, we have an emotion reconization system. I'm all for it. Professer Thomas Huang should keep making these.

I'm all for it, for some reasons. For one; it's said that the demonstration is suposed to bring a smile to people's faces, just as Dr. Huang said.

For a second reason, it can help us in classrooms. Huang said that the FACS, in time. would be able to tell if the students are bored and or confused. Which then, would let the teacher know to switch things up or help the students understand the assignments better.

Finally, moving facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.

"I am against driverless cars because of many reasons. One reason i""m against driverless cars because in paragraph 9 it talks about what if there was an accident who would be the fault the manufactur or the driver. I think the manufacturer should be the fault because its not the perosn using the product its the person who build it. They relied on them so they should be hela accountable for the situation. Then it says in paragraph 7 they are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. then turns around and says some manufacturers hope that they can install entertainment in the car for the driver. I believe that if they are geting entertained in the car how would they focus on the road. Also it says such displays can be turned off instantly. Just because it can doesnt mean it will.

"Have you ever heard of or saw the ""Face on mars""? In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacescraft was circling the planet and taking pictures ,as usual, when it noticed what seemed to be a human face. When the photos were released many people were impressed while others believed that the ""face"" is evidence of life on mars. Scientists believe that this is just a natural landform. If this was evidence of life on Mars it would have been a great benefit to NASA.

When NASA unvieled the photos of the ""face"" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to hide this information.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it? To further their claim that the ""face"" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decied to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals. After these pictures were relased people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been hidden by the wispy clouds. Mission cotrollers said ""It's not easy to target Cydonia""... ""In fact,

It's hard work"". In spite of all the complications on April 8, 2001, there was a cloudess day in Cydonia and the team was able to get very clear, defined pictures. The pictures showed that the Martian was like a butte or mesa, like the landforms around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Garvin.

Despite what the critics tried to argue, there was no way that the ""face on Mars"" proved life there. With more clear photos of the ""face"" and reasons to justify that NASA had no benefit for hiding life on Mars, scientists proved that the ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform that had a shadowy likness of a human face.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Venus, a planet that is the second closest to earth, and maybe second earth to be. The author suggests that the study of the planet Venus is worth pursuiting despite the dangers it with holds.

Venus is a planet that once had bodies of oceans and perhaps life living on it. The planet does contain high heat tempuratures as well as atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience here on earth. The conditions of Venusian geoloogy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquales, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface(paragraph 3).

The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These are not easy conditions but tolerable and survivable for humans.

In conclusion, the planet Venus should be worth studying and finding discoveries that would make living on Venus easier. The dangers and doubts should ot keep us from striving at our best to succeed.",1,2,0,1,0,0,1,0,0
"To begin with, I think we should keep Electoral Colleges because there are many benefits. A Electoral College is a process not a place in wich the founding fathers established to compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress and eleciton of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Some of the many benefits are a voiding run-off elections, it helps citizens votes be more meaningfull.

For starters, Electoral Colleges help avoid run-off elections. The benefit of having it avoid run-off elections is, that when there is a run-off election and when no canidates win a majority of the votes cast; the pressure is greatly reduced because of the electoral colleges. As a example, as a example you only have 43 percent majority of the popluarity votes. If more votes in the college is elected to one president than the other the president is alot more likely to win.

In addition, another reason on why we should keep Electoral Colleges are because it helps citizens votes seem more meaningfull. How a Electoral College does this is by, making you vote more powerful. If we didnt have these colleges democrats in Texas, and Republicans in California would know there vote wouldnt mean anything therefore they would not pay much attention to the election than if they knew the president was picked by populat votes. That is why in 2012 only half of the eligable voters voted because they knew that there vote would not make a difference.

In conclusion, that is why i think we should keep our Electoral Colleges, because is helps by avoiding run-off elections, and it helps citizens votes more meaningfull and has more power to know that popularity votes now count because of the Electoral Colleges and more elegible can now vote with confidence.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Today cars is one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions in the world.  Limiting car usage would be very benificial for today and future generations.

To start off there is many advantages to limit car use.  One example would be ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""  In Bogota, Colombia they have a car free day every year.  A lot of people participate in it and some enjoy it. With that day it lowers car mission and shows people that cars aren't nessary to have.  Another example would be, ""When I had a car I was always tense.  I'm much happier this way.""  Without cars people are happier and aren't as stressed as they would be if they still had a car.

Next life can go on without cars.  One example would be ""Vauban, Germany- Residents of this upscale community are suburban pionners: they have given up their cars.""  In this community there is little to no parking spaces.  The community is tightly packed together so that it is better to walk places.  Not only are their car free suburbas but cars are on a decline. An Example would be, ""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and gettiong fewer licenses as each year goes by.""  Even in America cars are starting to decline.  Teens and young adults aren't getting their licenses and dont have to get it as a priority.

The world of cars is changing and the way cities are planned is with it.  The reduction of car use will help lower greenhouse gas emissions for the future generations on Earth.",1,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever wandered about self-driving cars? I believe that they should be the next step in the automobile industry. Some reasons why self-driving cars should be part of the future is because of the traffic jam assistance, in car entertainment, and the safety of the self-driving vehicle. How does a car assist you in a traffic jam?

In the self-driving cars vehicle manufactors have built it to be able to drive in conditions below 25mph. When a person is in a traffic jam they begin to get bored and eventually sleepy. Instead of a person now continuisly have to push and release the gas the car now does that for you. Also when the car is driving the person is required to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times. This feature also alows the car to react if the driver falls asleep. Wouldent in-car entertainment just be another distraction to the driver?

Most people would say that having something else to watch while behind the wheel is a distraction to driving. For this in-car entertainment the feature would only be avalible for the driver when the car is in traffic jam assist mode and would instantly shut off when the driver needs to take over the car. How is all these gagets safe for the driver and all other drivers?

The safety of these self-driving cars has been checked over and over. More and more sensors are being put into the car to make it able to detect other cars and to stop/go when needed. Although one arguement about safety has been brought up about not having a human driver controlling the car at all times.

Have you wandered what a self-driving car would be like? I believe that self driving cars should be the next step for the automobile industry. Some reasons why it should be the future of cars is because of traffic jam assistance, in car entertainment, and the safety of the self-driving cars. What would it be like to have a self-driving car?",2,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,1
"Electoral College votes should be changed to election by popular vote. Electoral College votes don't really have purpose to them , but popular votes do. Instead of voting to choose electors to vote for the next president, popular votes seem more accurate , because it shows what president is more popular or wanted by the people.

To add on, electoral college votes not for the president, but for a slate of electors, states source 2. The electors are people not holding public office, which no one wants to vote for electors, the whole point is just to vote for the next president to serve and help maintain our country. Electoral College votes can be confusing also because voters may sometimes vote for the wrong canidate which is another problem if that person wasn't really voted for in the right mindset. To conclude, most people believe that electoral votes are unfair and in my opinion shouldn't be continued.

On the other hand, some people might agree to the idea of electoral college votes, it has certainty of outcome and sometimes the electoral college votes excede the popular votes , which gaurentee the win of the president elected. In toss-up states however, voters tend to pay more attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing canidates. So in toss-up states, thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election but electoral college votes don't necessarily let that happen. Lastly , electoral votes are kind of a good thing because it avoids the problem of elections where no canidate recieves a majority of the votes casted. With electoral votes, we avoid the problem of run-off elections and by doing so , the electoral votes help clear a winner.

In conclusion, the thought of electoral college votes all relys on someones opinion. If more people dislike the idea of the electoral college vote , then maybe it could be changed to popular vote only. In some peoples opinions, using electoral college votes are somewhat useless because most people who vote, their votes won't count , which makes the whole voting process pointless since everyone doesn't get a say in what president they should be able to have to help bring out and set forth their ideas. But popular vote allows that freedom of voting for the most wanted president, not the president picked only because electors wanted them. Voting is all based on the perspective of all people which is why electoral college votes should be changed to election by popular vote only.",2,3,0,1,0,0,1,1,0
"A new program, the Facial Action Coding System, regonizes facial emotions. It can show the different emotions on a person's face by the different muscles they're using. Prof. Thomas Huang's facial recognition technology is valuable for a classroom. It would show whether or not a student is enjoying the lesson and adjust lessons to the liking of the student.

First, the program could understand humans better to fit our needs. The article says, """"Most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that, too."""" This is telling how computers need to better understand how humans work, as in the different ways we convey emotions and thought. It also needs to know the different varients of human emotion. The article states, ""By weighing the diffferent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. each expression is compared against a neutral face."" This explains how the program wouldn't show a regular ""happy"" emotion and compare a human's to it, but instead start with no emotion and see which muscles are used to find the emotion. For example, the article states, ""She's 83 precent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" That's the emotion of da Vinici's painting, ""Mona Lisa"". The software states exaclty what her emotions are, not just one emotion.

Then, the program could act like a teacher and fix lessons to better the student. The article says, """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modifty the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""" This shows that Dr. Huang believes that his technology could, in the future, rearrange lessons and work them for the student better when working on computers. The article then states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The technology would personalize the computer to fit the user better, making it beneficial for a student.

The software helps identify different emotions in humans, including the ""Mona Lisa"". It can show different varieties of human emotions and then find if someone is enjoying what they're seeing online. This helps students by the program recognizing how they're feeling about lessons, then adjusting them to fit their needs. The program would really make a big difference for online teaching.",3,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"Cars these days can cause a lot of accidents and pollution. This happens mostly because people are careless people. Accidents mostly happens to young teens. Why teens? Well they are immature and most of the dont care about what happens around them. So they will get drunk or use drugs that will mess with their senses and most likely get them involved in a car crash.

Self-driving cars can be very handy. But it will take some time before they come out and are avalible for the world to use. They have a lot of problems right now, but their are people working on it. I honestly like self-driving cars because there wont be as many people dying and there will also be less pollution. Instead of kids getting drunk and driving then crashing they can get a self-driving car and get home or where ever they need to go safely.

But there is a disadvantage to this also. The cost of the car will be very high. As the text states ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors or the left rear wheel, rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotie radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" The car is going to be very expensive. Not everyone has the money to buy it.

Eventually the price will come down. But it will take many years for that to happen. But it will happen, looking at the cars from the 1900's to now. People will buy the car for sure. The cars that used to exist are out of style for the modern days. Now everyone drives the newer versions or the cars. It can be expensive or very cheap, but I still support the self-driving cars. Like I said, they wont be cheap but the prices will drop. There will be less accidents and less pollution.

Cars have changed a lot over the years and they will keep changing. Prices will go up, or they will go down. Techonology is advancing and it will keep advancing. I like the idea of the self-driving car and hope it exists soon.",2,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Venus, the second planet from the sun, and one of the most dangerous planets for exploration. The planet is strangly reffered to ""Earth's twin"", today it might not hold Earth's qualities, but long ago it was beilieved it did. Scientist's are set to beileve that at one point Venus had oceans and a possinble life sorce. A time before the extreme weather conditions, Venus is said to have flourished with oceans, supporting various forms of life, like Earth today. Now, that is long gone, taken over by a volcanic terrain. Exploring Venus will be dangerous and worth all the odds against it.

We, as humans, have already tried to explore the dangerous planet before. Each mission has been unmanned as no spacecraft has even survived the landing for more than a few hours. Nasa is now working on other approaches to studying Venus. One project being conducted states ""having simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" That will allow us to have a better understanding of limiting the exteme factors. Looking back to mechanial computers, will be easiter as it is more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Exploration of Venus would contribute emensally to our knowlendge of our sister planet. The author states ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors."" Through our curiosity, it will allow us to aquire insight into a new vast world, far beyond our exploration on Earth. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Space exploration has no limit, bounderies will inspire those to explore the unexplored and will allow us to push oursleves to places we have never been before.

Venus, an inhospitable planet, with extreme temperatures ranging up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, to the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater than on Earth. It may seem obsurd to even consider the possibility of even exploring the planet itself, but motivation and some inspiration it will take you to great places. Scientists today, are finding ways to get us their safely and effectivally. To building a possible hover craft to working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to require meaningful data. There are a lot of factors to be put into consideration when thought about, but with the right tools and knowledge one day exploring Venus might be a possiblity.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,0
"The best thing you can come up with is aliens?

That sounds like a very lazy excuse.

Of all the things you could've said, you said aliens.

There's more proof that it is just a formation other than an alien.

Your mind will change after you read this.

By the way, do you realize that the ""Face of Mars"" is a pop star?

First off, there is no trace of aliens on the planet.

NASA has been saying for years that it wasn't aliens that did it.

Why would NASA lie to the whole world?

Also, why would aliens make a human face?

It is just a huge rock formation that resembles a human head and that has been proven.

These kinds of thoughts always happen because of the media.

They always make something different from what it really is.

Now a lot of people think that NASA is keeping information from them, and that there is life on mars.

Whenever the media gets the chance to say something about aliens, they always take that chance.

Why do you people listen to everything you see or hear?

Isn't it dumb to think alien exists?

Let's be honest, what real proof do we have of aliens?

The fact the huge rock formation looks like a human face is just a coincidence.

Just because something has to do with space, doesn't mean aliens have to be a part of it.

Aliens are not in space so deal with it.

Sorry to upset you but we have to face facts.

Also if there were aliens, it would be best if the world didn't know.

But there are no aliens so we don't have to worry about that.

Face the facts because they don't exist.

Don't be a media follower because they are full with false rumors.",2,4,0,3,1,1,1,2,2
"In this article, it explains about how dangerous it is to travel and explore Venus. It mentions how our technology cannot last more than a few hours on Venus. From what was described in the first three paragraphs it seems like there is no way that you can travel or explore the planet without any hazards. The author claim's that there is a way to travel and explore the planet without any hazards. The information the author provides to support the idea is that there is a way and its a worthy prusuit despite the dangers there are.

Through out the article after paragraph three the author explains all the ways that make it possible to explore and study Venus. He explains in paragraph four that since Venus is much similar to our planet, Earth, that we should look into Venus again and try to gain more information about the planet. It's the nearest option for a planetary visit so why not. The author mentions in paragraph five that NASA has a idea for sending humans to study Venus in a safe way. Their idea was to have a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above to prevent being near the hot surface of Venus. At this height it will be survivable for humans. This sounds very workable. The only down side is that this makes it harder to study the planet and its surface. The author at the end of the article says that we should be able to travel to any place and should not be stopped or limited by any dangers and doubts.

Many of the authors claims in the article were quite good and were quite reliable. He used NASA to back up his claims about how there is a way to travel and study Venus in a safe way and why we should. Venus is very similar to our planet and it is also the closest planet to us. Even though it might not be easy to travel and explore the planet. We should anyways because this will not be only equally intimidating thing we humans will have face. We might learn some new things that might to lead to other things.",3,2,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"He supports his idea with a lot of facts. he also uses a lot of deytails whitch is good because we get a lil bit more of an idea. i get what the athour is saying because if you look at it venus is the second closest to the sun that is why it makes it so hard to land spaceships there. i think that the ships over heat when they are entering venus because it is so hot.

It would be cool if we knew what is in venus because we could find some new minerals or some other stuff. but i think that there no creatures because in paragraph 3 the first sentence talks about how the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide so that means nothing could be liven there. there is one example for why it is so hard to land ships on venus,m in paragraph 3 it says that the tempature can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit that is way to hot for the ship. and i dont think any human can land on venus do to the heat.

Even though we would risk a lot of chances it would be so cool for us to see what type of things are on venus. on paragraph 7 it says that nasas is working on other ways to study venus i think that it is going to be possible due to all the new technology we have. even though we have ships that hover over venus it is still hard for us to clearly see what is on venus .",2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Dear State Senator

My name is Mikayla and I am very concerned about how my president should be elected for the United States. It would be nice to change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States , not keeping the Electoral College. The Electoral College is unfair and should not be used to elect the President of the United States.

The Electoral College has it's issues to why it shouldn't be used to elect the president of the United States. Well for one the Electoral College system ""voters vote not for the president , but for a state of electors , who in turn elect the president."" In paragraph 10, sentence 4 it states that electors ""sometimes"" get confused. Why is that you ask? well because the people are picking the wrong candidates.

The electoral college is also unfair to voters. I say this because of the winner take all system in each state. in paragraph 13 , In paragraph 2 it states that canididates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning , they focus only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Personally i wouldn't want to use something like that if its unfair , outdated , and irrational.

We should change the election to popular vote for The President. Why you ask? good question. Well because that way it can be fair and reasonable. And let's not forget the voters wouldn't get confused.

The electoral college should be abolished forever. We should continue from now on by changing to election by popular vote for the president. Popular vote would be fair and everyone would love it.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
In this article they say the dangers of going on venus. they make it to where it is suitable for people to go on they make it to where theyre standing and floating 30 miles in the air . the pressure makes it harder for it to be liveable and the heat . They say its like taking an electronic on a machine chamber and letting it go and get heated and melt. venus has the hottest surface tempeture of any planet because its closer to the sun.they orbit the sun at different speeds which is why density is so high on venus. Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on venus. it didnt seem to work out but they sent humans there and tried to make it live able for them . The humans studied the planet and tried to get it to where it is most comfortable for people to go. they cant send electro devices because it will only damage them. They put them 30 miles in the air so that they wont feel the heat and presure against their bodies. this is the best suitable way for them to make it on the planet venus.,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Seagoing Cowboys program is the best around, we travel alot over seas to help others. You can also go sightseeing along the way! You get the thrill of seeing new things and helping those in need.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy is a unbelievable opprotunity for anyone! Including me, a small town boy that worked on a farm. When my freind Don Reist invited me to Europe on a cattle-boat I could not help myself, I had to go! When I first go onto the boat I was a little nervous but over time I got more acustomed to the life on the boat. I went to many places including Greece, Europe, China, Crete, and Italy!

Life on the boat is mostly fun! But there are some dangers too, I fell off a slippery ladder and I went feet first to the Atlantic. Luckily I got caught in a strip of metal on the side of the ship, but I could not worked because of cracked ribs. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would satisfy your thirst for adventure. But being in the program also involves hard work, and if you are wanting to help others in need than that work must be done.

You have to feed and care to the animals on board, and if you do that then you can also find time to have fun! You can play games like Table-Tennis, fencing, Boxing, baseball, and volleyball! I loved caring to the animals and having fun whilst doing so.

I was in the Seagoing Cowboys the most of any one. I made nine trips and I was discharged in 1947. I liked being in the Seagoing Cowboys, it revealed a world of people in need. That awareness stayed with me which led my family to host many international students and exchange visitors for years.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"The face on Mars is it a alien message or a natural landform.

I would say it is a landform. Why I will give several reasons why I think it is a landform latter in the argumentative essay i will be typing for Istep.

One reason I think it is a landform is how in the world could aliens bulid such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human. I don't get how would the even know what a human even looks like. If they had some sort of device the going around Earth taking pictures of us would NASA already know about it or the National Goverment.

My second reason why the face on Mars is a natursl landorm. Is how could the make it when it is made out of rock. Did they go find a rock and start just carving a human face into it, NO you want to know why because things like that on Mars can't be used, Why because if they could be NASA would have traveled to Mars by now. PLus how would they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out NASA seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of Space looking at different plants and such. So how could they not have seen that.

And for my thrid reason why the face on Mars is a natural landform. The text stats that their was no sigh of alien sighs or symbols the made us think that the aliens made this creppy looking face. BUt people say sense the 1998 trip to Mars was very cloudy when they toke the picture of the face. So they had to go back for a third time in 2001 a final prove that it is a natural landform and that is what they did. They shot a amazing photo that provide that there was no alien sighs or symbols by the face or around it.

The 3 reasons I gave you today are reasons why this face is a natural landform not any anilen made thing. That would be creepy and not right in my eyes. And maybe other peoples eyes. But to some people they think this is a alien made face which makes them crazy because it is definently a natural landform made form high winds and strong storms.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Well, me personally, i dont think its a good idea for a senator to change to that. I feel ike everyone should remain voting as usaul. If not this wouldnt feel like america anymore; America is all about freedom and the power of free speech....etc. This is what makes this country great; no dictator telling us what to do everyday. Without the power of voting this country would not feel the same. It wouldnt feel like america anymore.

Also, althoughs theres a lot of cons to this, really its just more worth it. It makes people feel impowered. Knowning that they're making an imoportant decision in life. It makes people feel free and glad that they live in america. Where you have a choice that yours and freedom at the palm of your hands. Plus, sometimes people have more different opinions than others on voting. You just cant count on some people that you dont know to choose for you.

"I think the use of this technology is valuable for games or computers or cameras because people can already kinda notice how other people emotions are by how there body movement are and how the tone in there voice is or the looks on there face. I think this technology would be helpful becasue on video games you can see the emotions of the characters on the game or the emotions of a person in a picture. Like It said in the article below the picture she's 83% happy, 9% disgusted and 6% fearful and 2% angry, that's what the new technology recgonized. Using video imagery the new emotion- recognition software tracks these facial movements. The new software can even identify mixed emotions to. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. In the article says Dr. Huang predicts then it could modify the lesson like an effective human insturctor; The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Dr. Huang also notes that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication so computers need to under stand that too.",1,2,3,2,0,0,1,1,1
"When you seen that face what did you first think of? There isnt a clear reasoning for natural landfrom. I believe that the Face is a symbol of aliens.

The pictures tell it all. They all change drasticly. And it looks as if the middle face the mouth is open, But the last one there isn't one.

Thats a sign. Someone is trying to talk and say something. And it isn't just a natural land form. That shows in the change in the second to third one.

What about weathering? That could have been that reasoning for happening.

Yes it could but weathering take hunderds to thousands of years so thats not possible between 25 years.

There is no right or wrong just yet but more reasoning pointing to non-natural landforming than there is alien civilazation. Reading the entire story was almost wasteful because i didn't need it for my claim. My thesis is still an ancient alien civilization.",0,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Student emotions can sometimes be hard to read. Students experience many different emotions everday throughout school. Some students may be happy and excited about school while others are bored and drowsy. New technology has been developed called the Facial Action Coding System. This system enables computers to indentify human emotions. This technology would be very benefiticial to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom.

With this new tech teachers would have the ability to read there students emotional expressions when they are giving a lesson. If the students emotional responses are boredom and drowsiness. Then the teacher will know they should change what they are doing so the students become more alert and interested.""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. If a student is becoming lost or dosent understand the material the computer will recognize that and the teacher will be able to stop and help that student.

The use of this tech will allow teaching in the classroom to become more efficent and if a student is struggling teachers will be able to recognize that quicker. This system will not only help with teaching but can also help emotionally. If a student is sad and going through some difficult things the computer can recognize this by the students facial expressions. The teacher then can talk to the sutdent and maybe cheer them up.

This technology can also help with school safety. Recently there have been alot of school shootings and threats. If a student has a look on their face that shows anger,sadness,intent,or rage. The computer will recognize this and the teacher may be able to prevent anything bad from happening to that student or other people in general.

In conclusion the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable in many different ways. It can make teaching more efficent. It can help teachers identify students who are lost or confused. It can recognize when a student is sad,mad,or angry therefore allowing the teacher the opportunity to speak with that student and see if they are ok.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,1,2

"Driverless cars seems like a futuristic thing that should be happening decades from now. But it is possible for it to happen soon. Maybe not completely driverless since the smart cars are going to be able to need the driver's alert. Driverless cars can be a very big change to the world.

Sergey Brin, Google cofounder, envisions a future that will be able to have a public-transport taxi system with driverless cars. The cars he imagines to be able to happen in the future would use half the fuel of today's taxis. And would be able to offer much more flexibility than a bus could. Sergey Bin says that this could fundamentally change the world.

Google has had cars that could independently drive themselves since 2009 according to the article. Google's cars aren't truly independent because they still require a driver to take over under certain conditions like pulling in and out of driveways, dealing with the complicated traffic issues, or navigating through any accidents on the road.

The self driving cars from Google have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Safety will be soemthing very important for the driverless cars if these were to happen. Car crashes happen oftenly among adults and teenagers that have the opportunity to drive. The causes for the accidents are mostly because people often wnat to be using their mobile devices while on the road. Texting is a problem while driving. It will obviously distract you from watching the road and cause you to be in an accident or just cause one. Manufacturers are hoping to be able to put cameras into the driverless cars so it makes sure that the person taking over the car is watching the road, and car is watching over the person so they can be alert when they have to take over.

Driverless cars seems like a good idea. It can make a big change to the world. Half the fuel can be used which is a good thing since the fuel from cars harms the earth since it causes greenhouse gases. With less fuel being used, the greenhouse gases can be avoided less. Driverless cars can bring upon much more safety since the cars Google has, have driven more than half a million miles without an accident. Which is good since accidents will be less likely to happen with these driverless cars.",2,2,3,3,1,2,1,2,2
"The role of driverless cars have become bigger and more accessable to the public and companies. There are pros and cons to these new developments but ultimately I believe they are for the best.

Although there are downsides to having driverless cars at the moment, such as not being comletely automatic, that will probably change in the future. The problem now is that the cars only automate themselves in certain situations so the driver has to be alert and ready to take over the wheel. So what's the

point of having a driverless car where you have to be alert at every moment? That is only a problem of the present. If more time and research is put into this project than eventually we will get cars that can drive automaticaly on the road full time without the need of being alert at all times. Human drivers make mistakes and that can cause harm to themselves and to others. Without the variable to human mistake, and if we could perfect the driverless car, there would be virtually no car crashes or car related injuries. Driverless cars have sensors and that let them take the right course of action or brake at the right time which could otherwise lead to accidents.

Driverless cars are getting smarter. With new developments in the technology and a few years down the road, driving could get a lot safer for everyone on the road. If we keep research and testing going than I believe that it will be a big step towards road safety.",2,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,1
"""The challenge of studying Venus"" is a very interesting story. In the story the author tells us a lot about Venus and its harsh conditions. The title describes the story very well. Venus seems like it would be very challenging to explore and the author gives many reasons why it would be so difficult. For some reason though he doesnt really list any benefits to exploring Venus.

Throughout the whole story the author is just making Venus sound like a horrible place. In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to.

Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth?

In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus.",3,3,3,2,0,1,1,3,1
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author prevents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. I believe in my own opinion that there should be driverless cars. There are many ways that these cars can help us people in our daily lifes. Here are three things that I think these cars can help us for talking/texting while driving, falling a sleep while dirivng, and preventing less car accidents while driving. Having these cars would be a huge help for people.

Firstly, we should driverless cars for talking/texting. With this car people can take all the time to check there phone when they need to. Most people while driving text or talk on their phone for either because something has happened to somebody close to them or because they have seen somthing that has gotten their attention. For example while someboddy is driving if somebody is texting and they're at a stop sign and someone is behind them the car could move itsself so that the driver behinfd them woudn't have to be waiting for long. This could also help prevent less accidents.

Secondly, we should have drverless cars for falling sleep. Many people fall asleep while driving a lot. This cause of this happening for people who don't get enough sleep at night. Or possibly someone could be on a roadtrip driving and this driver could have been driving for many hours this drverless car could come in handy for this situation. Letting the driverget some rest and letting the car driver for he or she. Falling asleep while driving is very common for accidents. Also, this is very scary for the driver who is driving and for those other drivers who are also on the road.

Lastly, we should have this driverless car so that he could help lower the death rate of preventing car accidents. With this car it could help save many lives. Having a car that can drive for you if your eating or even doing something that you probably shouldn't be doing is helpful. Having a car that could help you you with getting around things that you think you can't do is a help. What I mean by that is saying that you have to pull in or pull out out of a parking space.

In conclusion, we should really consider having a driverless vehicle. Having this as an option is very cool like can you imagine having your car drive on its own? If I were to get a car I would for sure get a driverless car just so I could text on my phone. With this car it could help people with their life, their everyday life, and for the community. I believe and think that everyone should consider getting a driverless car or even at least think about having one in the near future.",3,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0

It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the

""face"" has ridges or canyon. So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way.

NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face. They also believe it is an alien artifac. According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth. They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.

In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form. Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face. If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.",1,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,0

"Driverlees cars are coming and there are my whole thing on the driverless cars is that is there safe for the road safe on highways do they need gas in there how long can it ride does it need to be charger up well the psotive thing is that the diver less cars have gone miles without anything

happen to them but the only problem with them is that they still need help when pulling out of drivewyas or dealing with complicated traffic issuess, they have problems navigating through roadwork or acciends so what does that mean does it still need are help with thoes things well for the car to be smart you must need a lot of sensors in the car when google had use the toyota prius they had estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, rotating sensors on top of the car and a video camera near the rearview mirror plus all thoes thing you have four more sensors in the car evan a gps but the one thing on the car thats good is the sensors on top of the car why it has a laser beams that constanlty updating usesing 3-d model and check the surroundings of the cars and with that help the car can mimic the skill of the person that inside the car of ther driver with thoes sensors in the car diverless cars can but the brakes on its self or it can just turned the whole car up thats a good thing cause most people won't get into lot of crash.

in 2013 the bmw had made a thing called ""traffic jam assisant"" what the car can handle up to 25 mph, but with that we still goiing to have to hold the wheel of the car thats not a driverless car but what it can do is steer,accelerate, and break with other things the car might need are help such as going throught work zones are around other cars accidents so that means for us that we must always be ready for anything that could happen.

with that gm has made a thing for us inside the car that has sensors in them that tells you somthing going to happen you seat will vibrate when the car is in danger backing up into an object with the google car it tells you when you have to take over the wheel but there laso thinking about putting cameras inside the cars for you can be watching the road and while the car watches the driver.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you ever thought a computer could tell how people are feeling? I never thought that a computer could detect how people are feeling until I read about this new technology called Facial Action Coding System.

I think this new technology to read the emotional expression s of students of students in a classroom is valuable because a teacher can tell if you are confused or board. In the article, the author states that ""then it could modify the lesson, like an efective human instructor"". I believe this is true because it could help the teacher know who doesn't understand what they are teaching. It could also tell the teacher who needs it explained in a different way to help them understand it better. Having technology that can tell if a student is confused or board would have value becasue it could help teachers know which of their students are understand what they are teaching and which ones aren't.

I think that this new technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because people can tell how you are actually feeling. In the article, the author states that ""there are six basic motions-hapiness, surprise, anger, disguest, fear, and sadness.

"can autonomous cars be trusted? thats the question being brung up from this article because of the precariousness of how the car operates with no regulations to distinguish liability between consumers and the maufacturers. regulations on the smart cars autonomous functions are not even in the works yet as smart cars arent allowed and many states progress is a good thing and these new features for smart cars is what progress looks like, making driving easier and hassle free is what it seems to be aiming for, and while that can be seen the only problem is current traffic laws, what i mean by that is if the there are no current traffic laws that cover who would be liable in an event like if car malfunctions and causes an accident. it would be hard to decide if the problems with the car were caused by lack of care for car maintenace on the consumers side or rushed assembling on the manufacturers side but whie what i said is true it is also a small issue that can be remedied within a couple years with new breakthroughs in how the new features operate to be much more reliable in an event when they're needed and also when updated traffic laws are put into place to accomodate the new smart cars in conclusion while it could be dangerous to allow these cars to go in to a more widely public use i believe it should be put into developement as it is the next step for innovation in the automobile industry",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0
"Driverless cars is something that we have all saw, wether is be in a movie or had been referenced in a song or televison show. Cars that can operate by thereselfs is something every one would want to be alive to see happen, right? Who wouldnt want to relax a little while driving, and it be safe while doing it? The future would turn ito the present and driverless cars would became a well known thing and would be normal to see on the street.

""...such cars would fundamentally change the world."" says Google cofounder, Sergey Brin, and I totally agree. The world is becoming more technology advanced, and scientist are discovering new things everyday. Years ago, if someone had said that everyone in america, or nearly everyone, would be carrying a celluar device around that could tell us almost anything, and could send instant messages to another person, even if its half way across the world, they would flip out. I wonder what they would have thought about cars that drive themselves? If we have the technology and resources to do this, why not? Driving would be a lot more fun, and more safe too.

Car manufacturers always look at driver saftey when designing a new model, or brand of car.Although this is a key aspect, humans are prone to have error. We dont have vision to look at our surroundings all at the same time, although We sure try. Humans are prone to unprevented error, but with the help from technonlogy, having driverless cars can be a whole heck safer. ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position- estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receivers and an intertial motion sensor."" Thats a whole lot of detections all around the vehicle, even in the blind spots that we humans cant quite 100 percent see. The car would even alert you if it senses danger or a problem where it would need your assistence. In addition, It's even better for the world.

The car ""...would use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus."" The world we live in today takes such things as, gas, as underappreciated. Gas isnt cheap nor renewable. Once we use all the gas, there's no more left. We have a limited supply and its hurting the earth more than you think. The world needs to cut back on such luxuaries and the smart cars would help. Half the price, half the gas per car than an average car. They offer more eco-friendliness than any other. therfore, smart cars that drive themselves, or with assistance ,should be something all states allow.

In conclusion, smart cars should be something in the near future. New technology gives us the opputunity to do things we never dreamed of. These cars would fundamentally change the world as we know it. Safer cars equals safer people which equal more lives saved. The world would also be a better place for everyone seeing as the cars are cutting down on gas than a regular vehicle. Smart cars are in the near future.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0

There are many things to like about it.

Some examples would be; you are helping people, you get to see new places, and you have a lot of fun while traveling!

On Luke's trip, the Seagoing Cowboys, he helped the countries whom where in ruins after World War II, as it states in paragraph 2.

The atricle states World War II had just ended in Europe.

The UNRRA hired the Seagoing Cowboys so they could take care of the animals such as; horses, young cows, and mules.

Paragraph 2 states they shipped these animals over seas.

Another thing to enjoy about being a Seagoing Cowboy is, seeing new places.

Many people enjoy seeing different places and the intresting structures built there.

Paragraph 5 tells us that, Luke got to see Europe and China.

It also states he toured an excavated castle in Crete on his way to China.

Lastly, the boys had fun while traveling.

Pargraph 8 states, they played baseball and volleyball in the empty holes where the animals had been housed.

They also had table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more to help pass the time while traveling.

Luke had a great time in his days as a Seagoing Cowboy.

Car free? but wait at the the main throughfare tram downtown is where all the cars park well a few cars park there.

Vroom Vroom if your going to buy a car you need a garage and a house dont you you need a house to store all your belongings and your family inside and you need agarage to put your fancy new car in all the cost comes up to about $40,00 thousand dollers. About 70% of the people who live in

Vauban,Germany do not own a cars and the other 57% sold there to move here. but once you come here all youll see if bicycles and people having good convosations and children just wondering about the streets of gemany. The  city of Vauban finished in 2006 growing a trend in

Europe the suban city of

Germany isnow called smart planning.

Other suburbs in other countrys have to have to pay gas its about 12 percent of the greenhouse gas in

Europe .

While in  the city the government is trying to make the city denser and for people and kids to walk around in a health enviornment about 5,500 within a mile have a low- car actually live in a low car suburban life. In the new life thats going on now its goinf to be easier for people to walkin in and out of malls they can finally walk in the main street rsther than walk a long distance way to get to their destionation.

Around the world where they have tight spaces like

New York and maybe

Georgia are starting to look like these little surban cities in

Germany and

France . In the cities that we have talked about about 80% of people have gone to law highways and the other 20% use the transportantion that there to bring them around.

"In my opinion, no the use of technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Do I believe computers are smart? Sure. But computers arent as smart as humans. Computers do what us humnas tell them to do. I don't believe they can be so advanced as to be asble to read our emotions.

Humans can't always identify another humans emotions, so how can a computer? There's people out in the world whos regular face looks like they're sad, mad, angry, happy, etc. The computers going to pick up that they're always the same emotion, no mater what the situation. Not only that, but there are tons more emotions then the classified six basic ones. Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS picks us just 6 emotions? If thats the case, the computers missing at least hundred other emtions. What about the other emotions? If someone is concerned, unpleased, or please is the computer going to be able to pick that up?

In the reading it says that Dr. Huang states that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" How? Like i said before, computers do what we want them too. So how can they read our face expressions? Point blank, they can't. If the world agrees on using this technology for students in the classroom, its a bad idea.

To start with, is a invasion of privacy. If students dont want the teachers know if they're sad or in fear of something, then the teachers dont need to know. Nor do the other students or memebers of the school. If the teachers want to know if the students are bored, or uninterested the teacher should be able to ask the class 'Are you interested in this topic?"" ""Is this topic boring you."" Not being able to look at a screen and count how many are interested and how many are not

Second off Teachers are here to teach us, not be our parents and have pep talks with us. Is school about socializing and meeting people? Yes, to some extent it is. But school is for learning and preparing us for life out of school. Many schools talk about ""Oh, the consulers are here for you if you need to talk."" ""We want you to come and talk to us if something is wrong."" Seriously? That's all wrong. Am I the only kid that had to fill out a ""slip"" and waited until the consuler got with me? Uh, isnt it suppose to be the other way around? Being able to have a technology that can read the students expressions or emotions isnt right, it's honestly kind of dumb. The computer can pick up the six basic emotions right? So what happens if a students wants to get out of class? Does he or she put on a sad face and when the teacher notices sends them to the office? Kids arent dumb these days. We know how to work around the technology and beat the system.

In my opinion technology is getting out of hand. How long ago was that painting painted? A hundred years ago? I don't know. But how can we be so sure that back then people knew what emotions were? Was Mona Lisa really disgusted? If so, about what? Or was she really fearful? What was she so fearful about? What about being angry? Why was she angry? Why was she 4 emotions all at once? I dont know about you, but i've never had more then 2 emotions i felt at one time.

After reading this article and seeing my opinion it should be clear that i say no to having this in the classroom. I believe that thistechnology about reading emotions, shouldnt have even been invented.",4,3,2,3,0,1,2,3,1

"Well the bad thing about being over seas. Is that when you or one of your family members go.

There is a 99 percent chance that you or your family memeber will die or get hurt.

Luke also wanted to go seasgoing to show his friend how manly he is. Because his friend thought that hhe was scared to do something that is not normal in his life.

So Luke wen't over sea to show his friend he is not afraid. But when Luke is over seas something bad happens. Luke is feeding the animals, and he trips over something and just about fell over board to his death.

Luckly a peace of medal was sticking out the side of the ship and caught Luke before he almost died. Aways be carful when you on a ship traviling. Something bad aways happens. But anways Luke had a friend come along so they could hang out like most friends do.

Luke and his friend was on the ship, and they stopped at a place where the horses and the animals had to get off. Then the boys had to find something to do so where the horses and the animals stayed is where the two kids started to play games like Baseball, Volleyball, Table-Tennis, Fencing, Boxing, Reading, and Whittling.

So when the two boys were done doing their stuff like playing games they wen't back to their homes, to see their families. But when their time was up off seeing their families they both wen't back to the ship, and said bye to their families for a long time then it was time to go.

The two boys did the same things they had done the last time they were on the sea. Then finally the day the two adults have been waiting for has now arrived to them. Now it is time to go back to their homes for good, and stay with their siblings and parents, and friends.

One thing that all the people noticed when the two got back fromw sea. Is that the two boys they use to be are now gentlemen, not lids anymore. Then the never let those two lovible boys go on sea again. They couldn'y loose the boys again. Not now, not ever, never again.

But of course they left again they could not stay with their families for ever. They just had to go back on seas again they had to. It was like their life when they wen't on the ship.

The audults were now old enough to go to the military. Lukes friend wen't on. Lukes friend entered the military as soon as possible. He really wanted to support his countries.

When the two kids got back to each other and started hanging out again. THey both wen't back to the sea job again cause they really liked it. They wen't there together nine times so they could see each other alot, and they hung out alot of course.

When they got bak the two boys wen't straight to dee their mothers to see them right away. But when they got there they did not see there mamas at the house. Then the siblings and the other family memebers came out and told the two boys that their momas were gone.

"All around the world, people are using gas-gusling vehicles of mass destruction. Recently, Germany came up with the revolutionary idea to limit the use cars by forbidding street parking, driveways, and home garages in the new, experimental district of Vauban. Others have joined the bandwagon as well, instituting new laws, such as the ""Car-Free Day"" in Bogota, Colombia, and the partial-driving ban in Paris, France. France, Germany, and Colombia are the predeccessing countries to the innovational car usage limitations. These limitations have many advantages, such as a decrease in pollution, traffic, and a long-term positive culture shift.

Pollution and the emission of green-house gases is one of the common issues troubling countries world-wide. A limit of the use of cars and other various vehicles that run of fossil fuels has been proven to help counter the depleation of Earth's Ozone layer. According to

Source 2: Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,

""[The Smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world... Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" The city of Paris had legislated, ""On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day"" (

Source 2

). Resulting from their legislation, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday"" (

Source 2

). Paris, originally one of the worlds' most-polluted cities, decreased their pollution so much in one day that it was deemed unnecessary to continue the ban for the odd-numbered license plates the next day. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (

Article 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars

). A decrease in these emissions could have significant effects, as witnessed in Paris. Also, a Local Colombian businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza claimed that the Car-Free Day was ""a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (

Source 3: Car-Free Day is Spinning into a Big Hit in Bogota

). The government and their factions are in agreement that the ban on cars is only positive. Whether it is Colombia, Germany, or Paris, the restriction on drving was a major success. Imagine if more countries around the world opted to institute this ban; there would be no energy-crisis nor would there be as much of a pollution issue.

Along with the decrease in pollution, there would be a massive decrease in traffic. The vehicular limitations in the beta-countries (France, Colombia, and Germany) have shown that the restrictions imposed decrease the amount of traffic significantly. Based on

Source 3 , in Bogota, ""... a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Rather than having a holier-than-thou complex, these Colombians supported the greater good of their country and ceased use of all cars on the car-free day. A positive domino affect occured in Colombia as well. According to

Source 3 , ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" These beta countries have improved the standard of living by meerely putting some restrictions on driving for brief periods of time. The United States has seen various changes as well. While there are no current driving restrictions, new priorities are being discovered, such as the bike-sharing program in one of America's most heavily trafficed cities, New York. According to

Source 4: The End of Car Culture , ""New York's new bike-sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities, as do a poliferation of car-sharinf programs across the nation."" Nations are beginning to catch on to the contagious cold of revolutionary alternatives to driving and traffic crises.

France, Germany, Colombia, and the United States are already seeing positive changes. The long-term culture shift is proving to be an aspiration for many countries. According to

Source 4 , ""The internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of city centers has made the suburbs less appealing and has crawn empty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work."" People are becoming more connected through digital devices as societies become more technologically advanced, therefore the need for a large amount of privately owned cars has become moot. In Vauban, Germany, Heidran Walter, a media trainer and mother, claims, ""When I had a car, I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (

Source 1

). Commoners, such as Mrs. Walter, are respoding positively to the laws of the experimental district of Vauban, which has very few areas and opportunities for cars. In fact, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here"" (

Source 1

). This modern-day industrial revolution is drawing vast numbers of people into the areas inwhich cars have become a rarity.

Source 1 also states that ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""."" The beta countries have had much success and have not seen failure yet. Although in France, ""Almost 4,000 dricers were fined... [Twenty-seven] people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine"" (

Source 2

), it should not be considered a failed experiment. Of the millions of people who live in France, they only saw a small fraction of driving infractions on the day they limited driving. The long-term culture shift that the world is beginning to see is certainly moving in a positive direction.

Between ISIS and the iPhone, the world has come across a variety of both positive and negative circumstances. Considering all of the positive effects of limitations of cars, including but not limited to less traffic, a decrease in pollution, and long-term culture shifts, there have been many advantages to the switch to a car-free enviornment. Even though transportation may take longer, it will be safer and better for the enviornment. Not everyone country can guarantee that all of their citizens will abide by the new laws, as shown in France, but a small fraction of the trouble is better than the mass population of millions, and in some places billions, wrecking havoc on the planet.",3,4,3,3,1,2,3,3,2
"I believe that driverless cars are good for the future. With technology improving every year it is very possible. Self driving cars would make traffic safer i believe. Technology is improving every year. Cars are getting very close to driving on their own. Here is why i think they are great to have in the future.

Technology improves every year with new technology be made or being more improved. Since the 1980s technology has improved or advanced in the article it said "" In the 1980s,

automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" Also the radars, sensors, mapping, and computers werent there to build a driver less car.The radar that are put on the Google modified Prius werent able to be put on a car before the year 2000 the cost for a radar was two hundred million dollars and it wasnt even small enough to put on a car radars before 2000 were put on hilltops. Now they have mulitple radars on one car. That is how far technology has advanced.

Self driving cars would make traffic much safer. I believe with all the technology put on a car there would be a reduced amount of accidents. With all these sensor put on a car it would be able to detect surroundings. The Dubbed LIDAR uses laser beams to create a constant 3-D model of the car and its surroundings. As said in the article ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" Imagine 3 or 4 years from now. We are gonna have technology that doesn't alert the human to stop but the car itself stops on its own if it gets to close to a car or the light turns red or a pedestrian walks by due to its sensor, cameras, and software the will stop.

Auto makers are getting closer and continuing their work to create a self driving car for the future. Mercedes-Benz, audi, and nissan are planning to have cars that drive themselves by 2020. Tesla on the other hand has projected a car that is capable of driving on its own 90 percent of the time. As said in the article ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car cabable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" this is great for the future aswell there technology is only gonna advance as the years go by and become 100 percent cabale of driving on their own.

That is why i believe that driverless cars are a marvelous idea for the future. Technology is and has improved. Self driving cars will make traffic much safer. cars are much closer to driving on there own since the 1950s. That is why i feel very positive about self driving cars.",3,3,3,3,1,2,1,1,2
"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives readers details on how Venus is Earth's ""twin."" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in both size and distance. The author discusses with readers why scientist want to explore Venus and how they are taking the steps to do it. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how humans have the technology, why exploring Venus is important, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploration.

First, the author supports their idea that the danger of exploring Venus well by explaining how humans do have the technology to explore Venus. The text gives examples of many advancements that have been made in order to explore Earth's sister planet. The author writes, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This quote shows that the author's idea is well supported because it gives an actual example of the technology that has been created in order to explore Venus. Space exploration has been advancing and improving for years, so eventually humans should be able to explore planets with the worst conditions easily. Another way that the author's claim is supported is when they discuss that the technology needed has been around since before humans even traveled to space. The text discuss a device that has been around since the 1800s and played a significant role in World War II. This goes to show that humans have more than enough resources to travel to Venus no matter how dangerous it may be. In all, the author supports the idea that exploring to Venus is worth any danger that humans could face well by giving information on the technology that humans already have to do it.

Secondly, the author supports their idea that going to Venus is worth it because they discuss how important it is to explore Venus. The text discusses that out of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like Earth. The text reads, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life, just like Earth."" This quote displays that the author's idea is well supported because it tells the readers how important exploring Venus is. By studying Venus, scientist could learn more about different forms of life. There could have been different plants and animals on Venus then there is now on Earth. If scientist were able to figure that out, it would be an amazing discovery and could improve the world's knowledge on space overall. Furthermore, the author talks about how much more convinient it is for humans to travel to Venus. Since space travel can take years, Venus is one of Earth's only options for exploration. So, the author's claim is well supported because they talk about how significant the exploration of Venus is for science.

Finally, the author's idea is well supported because even though they support the exploration of Venus, they still discuss the possible dangers of Venus. It states repeatedly in the text that Earth's conditions greatly differ to Venus's. The text says that ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This shows that the author's claim is well supported because they are acknowledging the fact that the exploration of Venus is not an easy task. Sending humans to Venus can be a fatal misson, so it is a good thing that the author can explain that, while still supporting their claim. Another way the author shows the danger of exploring Venus is in parapgraph three when it reads,"" These conditons are far more extreme than anything the humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This shows that the author's idea is well supported because they still acknowledge the fact that going to Venus is extremely danger for both humans and any sort of machine. In summation, the author's idea is well supported because despite the fact that they are for the exploration of Venus, they still informed the readers on the dangers.

Consequently, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their idea that exploring Venus no matter the dangers well by explaining how humans have the technology needed, why exploring Venus is important for science, and by informing readers on the dangers of exploring Venus despite the fact that they believe that it is worth the risk. The author of this text informs readers well and has an open mind while writing since they did explain the dangers. The readers can form an opinion on this subject since the author both dicussed how exploring Venus is important and how it may be extremely dangerous to explore.",5,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Have you ever went on a camp out in the woods? Have you ever went camping out on water but for about 2 months? Now you can there is a progm that helps animals go to a different country. There are animals that need fed and you can do every night or even be a look out for whats coming ahead. The trip is fun but dangerous. You have to go on a boat that moves back and fourth. The fun part is that you can stay up all night and you get to never wake up unless its your job to feed the animals.

Luke's claims are having fun and being with his best friend. Luke also knew it would be a lif time opportunity. Luke was watching out for ahead and checking on the animals then he went to tell captin that when the ladder was wet and slippery. Luke fell and his heart pounding like a hammer. Luke was almost dead but he wasn't he broke a couple of ribs but hes fine he and work for a couple of days.

I dont know if i would join sounds fun too. Joining the prograhm was to help for world war ll also. The war was tough because there was a lot of stuff ruined by it too world war ll was a desaster but we thank the people that were in it.

"Driverless are something you think about in the futrue but no driverless cars are coming. Google's cofounder Sergey Brin envisions a future wth driverless public transportation. The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis use. They would have more flexibility then a bus. Sergey Brin believes driverless cars would change the world.

Google has been working on these kinds of cars since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. Google cars arent not driverless ; the car alerts the driver when dealling with complicated traffic. Different companies are making computer driven cars. In 1950s , General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. The track was embedded with an electrical cable to a receiver on the car. The problem with smart-roads is that it would be to expensive to upgrade the roads. The problem with driverless car is that if the car got into an accedent who is at fault the operater of the car or the manufacture.

Driverless cars are soon to be part of our world. The cars would be extremely use full in big communitys and replace taxis. The problem is the cars are not 100% driverless and if the car get in to trouble and the driver is not paying attention there will be an accident.",0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit beause it is near the earth and orbits near the sun like earth. But tthey think its still dangerous to think about having a human visit Venus. The text states, ¨ Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explainswhy not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than 3 decades.¨ This explains that it can be dangerous in Venus if these spacecrafts can´t be found down in Venus.

There is more to how Venus can be dangerous to a human. Since Venus is closer to the sun, the high temperature it is which makes a human less chance to survive in the heat. The text states, ¨ the planets surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.¨ Also in Venus there is gases that if a human lands at, it wouldn´t be safe and harder for them to breathe. The text states that since the atmosphere in Venus is so thick, 97 percent carbron dioxide blankets are in Venus. The text states,¨ Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus´s atmosphere.¨ Which make that harder for someone to breath in Venus.

NASA is working on how to study more about Venus taking taking risky challenges. The text states,¨ some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos off Venus´s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such condition. This shows how NASA tests to investigate more about Venus.

Venus is a planet to lose to the sun that a human can sufficate from the heat and too much carbon dioxide. These researchers are working hard either making spacecraft or some other things so they can send to Venus and investigate more positive things about the planet. The researchers are so curious about finding miners and others things that can be useful or used as a display or they want to see if a human is able to live in Venus safely. This all states why researchers are so curious about the planet Venus.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Face is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. First of all why would NASA hide something like that from us? Second of all the Mars has not shown signs of life form, it has been vacient for as long as we know. Though it has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years, don't beleve everything you here or see in a movie it's not factual.

NASA couldn't/wouldn't hide something like aliens from us. They have all of the facts they need to determen that this was not done by aliens. They have done reaserch and test to determan that its not done by aliens. Aliens are just mithical creatures.

Mars has been empty for as long as we have been able to go to Mars. It is just the rock formation and the shadow giving it the affect of looking like a face. The pictures show it was just rocks. The first one 43 meters per pixel compared to the new image that spans 1.56 meters both show the same thing.

The Face has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years! Do you beleve in every move you watch,every magazine you read, or how about every talk show you listen to. Unless you do you probly dont beleve in this alien nosnese you beleve in reaserch and facts. NASA has come up with these facts to prove its not created by aliens.

The Face created by an alien is just a conspiracy theory. It is shaped like a face but it is the shadows that make us beleve it looks like a face. Do you think some how that aliens have made it so the shadows are alaways there so it always looks like a face.

Mars has as many aliens as we do here on earth. Secrets and lies all come out eventualy. Here on earth there is life formes but not on mars.

"First I would explain

to them that that martian mesas are common around cydonia,I would probably research important facts to support my claim. I would explain that the ""face"" is really pilled up rocks that give off the illusion of a person features, eyes,mouth, nose, things like that. In the passage it says ""What the picture actully shows is the martian eqivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the american west.A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the face, through all the years of research and the uncovering of rocks people started to realize that the face really wasnt there. Scientist took pictures during the years 1976, 1998, and 2001 to give show us what we thught was a face was really a natural landform. On april 5,1998, when mars global surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, michael malin and his mars obiter camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origianl photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitig when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform not a face or a alien monument after all. I feel like everyone should look at the facts and lab researchs to fully understand what they thought they sawbecause they were obviously mistaken.",1,3,3,3,1,2,1,2,1
"I personally think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think driverless cars would be a good idea because of how busy a person may be on the road. Driverless cars would also help in assistance with when driving long distances for a long period of time. Permiting driverless cars would also make the driving world a bit safer. Driverless cars arent such a bad idea in the long run because they'd help in assisting someone whos busy while driving, it could assist people that have to drive long distances in long periods of time, and it would also make the driving world a bit safer.

Making driverless cars seem very useful to the future. In the paragraph it tells how in 2013 BMW developed a ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" car. This car can handle driving at speeds up to 25 mph . This could assist a person who is on their way somewhere and perhaps needs to call someone on the phone for any important reason. The 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" car could also help when the driver is going on a long empty high way for a long period of time. Like if the person needs to drive out of time and is driving on a long highway. My last reason i think the driverless car would be helpful to the future would be to make the driving world a bit safer. In example Toyota Prius's use position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four auto motive radar sensors, and more. The four automotive sensors around the car and the video camera near the rearview mirror would help greatly to the dirver when needing to back up into a parking space. If the sensors indicate any danegr of out of control skids or rollovers the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on each wheel and reduce power from the engine.

The idea of driverless cars i think would be a good idea, in assistance of the driving world of the future. Driverless cars could help the driver in multiple useful ways. Driverless cars would require not so much great driving skills when driving, which puts less worry on the driver when on the road.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"After my high school graduation I worked in a grocery store and bank. Life couldn't get anymore boring. Then, my friend from school, Don Reist, invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat with him. Of course I said yes, I mean, it was the opportunity of a life time. In Europe, the UNRRA was hiring Seagoing Cowboys. After long and hard thinking, Don and I signed up.

It was the best desicon ever. I got to travel all over the world, take care of animals and have fun on board. The other cowboys and I played volleyball, baseball, fencing, boxing and other sports to pass the long time on the boat. That's what I loved about this job. A once in a lifetime opportunity became a full-time job for me. I got to see England, China, Italy, Greece and France. You also should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

"When you were younger about 15 or so didn't you always want to drive? Well for the next generation that dream will be snatched no longer willl they get to experince driving.I am against the building of driverless cars.There are two reasons I am against driverless cars. First off it takes the fun out of driving. Secondly its dangerous.

To begin with driverless cars take the fun out of driving. No one wants to sit inside of a car and do nothing. Getting your driving liscense is like a new found freedom, how would you feel if immediatley after getting your liscense instead of driving yourself you were getting drove around? no one would want that. which is why i am against driverless cars

Also driverless cars are dangerous. They are ran by computers which from time to time do malfunction. Companys are putting entertaintment features in the car which distarcts the driver if he needs to take over the wheel. Another point brought up in the essay is that whos to blame when the driverless car runs into another car. An incident of that nature would cause the blame game. manufacture wouldn't take credit and neither would the driver or should i say copilot. Also computers can be hacked. Say the president was in a driverless car and someone wanted him dead it would be very easy for them to hack his car and send him off a cliff.

In conclusion, Driverless cars should not exist because they can cause conflict and because they are boring",1,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,1
"My position on this situation is that it would help a lot of people out. In my opinion, I believe driverless cars would be a great idea. They could help with the flow of traffic, help people who are not the best at driving, and help prevent crashes form occuring.

According to the article, the evolution of cars has come a long way. In paragraph 3, General Motors was trying to create the concept of a car that would run on a special test track. It worked surprisingly well but it would turn out to be too expensive. In 2013, BMW developed ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" which a car would travel up to 25 mph. The only problem was that they weren't completely driverless.

It could steer, acceleerate and brake, which is an amazing concept and could help with elderly people who can stop in time or go fast enough to go with the flow of traffic. It states in paragraph 7 that, if a car happens to be in a dangerous situation, GM has created a system that will vibrate the seats when the driver needs to take over. While the Google car simply announces that the driver must take over. In paragraph 9, it says that in most states it is illegal to even test drive computer operated vehicles. If a new law is created and passed it will allow driveless car to be legal, I believe that they will become very popular.

Although the thought of this driverless car idea, the drivers need to be aware and still watch for any signs that something bad might occur. Drivers must always stay focus and with the right people driving them, it would be a fantastic idea. If the system were to malfunction and the car no longer can drive itself, then the driver must be ready and still know how to drive a car normally. With more testing taken place to see if that would ever be the case, people would be more willing to try it out and see if its a good idea. Who knows, it might be the next big thing. With technology always changing and new ideas occuring, the future is bright and holds so much potential.",1,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Whats up with the electoral college? Can we really trust it? Ofcourse you cant and all that apose can stand up and walk out the door .The presidental race is a fake!!! So the goverment wants to tell you that you need to be a citezen to vote but what are you voting for? The electoral college is a fraud, your supposed to send your personal opinion to vote for the president of your country, not some lazy bum that sits in a chair all year and when time comes to put his vote in he overides yours and the peoples votes for you and not even care because they are getting paid to?

It only takes two hundered and seventiy votes from the electoral college to elect the president when theres over two billon residents in the united states? You mean to call this a demcracy when its really a underground dictator ship. I dont know how hard it is to bribe a person in a high postion but it is hard to bribe a whole country and thats why I belive we should get to actually vote for the next presdent theres no trust into the peoples belifes i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country but i promise you we wont fool around and compirmise the whole system beliving in our own belifes!!! these fancy bosos mignht thuink they know what their doung but they really dont there just a bunch money thisrty pigs and it isnt fair to the people to rely on theb electoeral college to pick the fate of our country as long as we live on it

The fact that we cant even pick the electors make it even worse i mean how are we even supposed to trust them i dont know who they are do you? how do you know what the legislators a caplble of they could have been bribed and no one would even know i mean the goverment already has alot of secterts and they could be asdding on the them and you wouldnt evem knowwhy beacuse its the goverment there broken up into little pieces of fruadery its incredibly anoyying to know that if you even try t fight about the rights of a cietzen you'll lose not even having to walk into the court room because the goverment runs that too!!!

Every time i would ask the teacher I would always get the same responce ""thats a good question let me get back to you on that."" I know that its not the teacher because im pretty sure the presidnet cant even ansewr that. Even in source three it dosent answer my question and its the electoral colleges defence but their defense isnt that strong sorry to tell you that it gives me five reasons but there not strong reasons and I belive source two out battles the both  source one and two.

"Driveless Cars are not a good idea for some people and other its ok for them. It should be a choice for the person who wants it or not. The reason why they arent a very good idea is that a person can crash and you wont know what happend, was it the car of was it the person driving. When you want to instail a radio you dont know what you can do about the wires in the car Should you cut that one or should you not. Its just a lot of worries and a lot of what's going to happen to the car.

It's nice to know some people are trying to change the world and a lot of people support it.In the story it says that. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph."" What if a person has to get some where why would you want to just go 25 mph. There should be some switch that you can turn on and of so you can drive over 25 mph. they should make a

car tht just park for you not one that drives for you.

If their going to make a driverless car they might want to make a driverless semi to. They do not know for sure whats going to happen to the car in the real situation on the road. They talk about a ""If the tehnology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the diver of the manufacturer?"". Thats proof that they do not know what is going on and they will some day. But is that day to day that is a question that you ask yourself?

They think that they will make a car that is able to drive themselves. If I could i would ask them If they have it done yet. They say that they did not have the technology to do it bace then. That means that they should get the technology and get it right the firs time. Will it make you battery go down faster or will it use more gas.

It's harder to make a car that needs a lot of technology than one that does not. It takes twice as longer to produce the cars that they need to sell. People want to buy a car that is cheep. They want to know how to start the car and drive in it. That's why I think that a car should not be driverless.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Dear Florida senator,

The United States has changed drastically and continously over the few centuries that have passed away. Americans, have been building up since our founding fathers to become the democracy we are today, a democary of ""we the people"". Citizens, are given the privilige to vote or not to vote and choose our leaders, but that is not what the electoral college vote has to offer. The electoral system over complicates things, lies to the people, and is not fair to voters and in its delivery.

The electoral process is a disaster that disorderly combust into problems. Because of it, issues like the election of Al-Gore who won the popular vote,but lost presidency due to the system, has caused confusion and controversy. This wouldnt have happened without the system that lies in front of the people. We voted for some one and we should have gotten that person.

The unfairness of the system goes way beyond than the probability of the losing candidate to win, and it has an incline towards one side that may harm the other. Although the ""winner-take-all"" method brings greater focus from candidates to campaign for and to address the real problems that voters need, it results in a battle between candidates to go for certain states that leave others with no benefit. In other words, a candidate may leave your state to recieve the silent treatment while others benefit from the attention.

To wrap it up, the electoral system causes an unfair incline towards certain objectives that the voters need. The electral system needs to be abolished.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Today in the world, are you happy? Happy with how the world is growing up and acting or ashamed on how it is pleading to those who live in it to finally change for the better which isn't happening. Yet some children of mother nature or of the universe do believe that only living off of the non-materialistic ideas in life can help you get farther. However many people take pride in indulging on the sins that used excessively can't get them out of the hole they were forced into. Sterotypical people who contradict themseleves or those whom tend to be hypocrytes for that they don't understand always fail to stand for the better. I believe, that in all honesty, no one should be happy with the location of where they stand in society. Due to how far technology has gotten not even within the past two centuries, it must be stopped as a whole. Now let's actually discuss our main objective to throw out the window. The topic to fully dive into, based upon facts and personal opinions, Can stopping the mechanical reproduction of automobiles truly help the world out?

Just think about it, what are the possibilies that are being entitled within this topic in particular; but most importantly is there any way the upcoming generations can switch everything or everyone around, to change the mindset of all of the billions of people living on the planet to make it up for the better since we all know the way we are heading is not the place we should go? How fast or slow can this idea be put into place? The world we now know is indeed needing to be resureccted based alone on how much harm we have caused within the past few centuries. If you rely on technology too much doesnt that hurt yourself even more in the long run? Strategies or new found plans should be taken into consideration based on the facts presented and dismissed in the past because the way we are living and teaching those those who are newly born, should know that the world around them isn't right anymore, and direly needs help to improve. The society we are now dealing with, needs to play a new game or the world will end in more corruption than originally thought would happen. In all, isn't it good sometimes, to think about what is wrong and what you could do to help out? Now just sit and think to see where your own mind could lead you. Down the path were the world is once again healthy and happy? Or the path of destruction?

The path of destruction can lead to many implications based on health, or survival of the fittest, based on social status or skills gained in a hard cold world mostly dependent on how or when you grew up, due to how society changes over time. Scientists know based on their own work that the atmosphere can only handle so much pollution until it gives out and the world as we do know, learn, and live with can die. Do you want to see the slow demise of where you live, the place where is the only home known to man of the human species? Seeing death upon the streets due to failing natural health means, does it not actually hurt the heart to see such things? Plus car's do take too much space needed for other necesisties such as more room or storage to live a basic daily life in. Yes we may have the technology to fix natural things artificially but does it make it right to think that it will work? Cars cause pollution, pollution cases for health issues, health issues lead to over crowding at the hospital with disease, work load increases and those who work will tire and then eventually get sick themselves for which the most able to achieve end for this ongoing process could be death. Now do you understand where I might be getting at? Being sick mentally or physically is just the first step into a change in mind where all can go to hell and break loose or done in a good way, could change the future generations to restart where we all began. This is all just the basics of the wrong path imagine what could happen if nothing is done to stop the hurting and resume the healing.

Although that is the begining of an era that could happen due to stupidity or greed could you do us all a favor and imagine a realistic dream of what could happen if we dropped technology as a whole? All the metals could be recycled for greater purposes! Cars will lead us to see a whole new or happier society where socializing could be the end of all problems. Our health will be in tip top shape, everyone will finally understand what it could mean to live in harmony. Money not spent on transportation could be saved for greater purposes similar to expenses for your child's college maybe even for the advancement of useful environmentally friendly sciences to be learned or help funded or whichever other purpose you can think of. Yes one bad point is that many jobs could be lost but there is always back up plans that you could create for the worst case scenario. However, otherwise society will be happy and health issues should decrease if many of us chose to instead walk or use a bicycle to our destination, so isnt that a better dream to dream? ""Keep Moving forward"" as stated by Walter Disney, can that dream not be achieved by any means to increase the chances of a world where anything is possible to demand or chase after? Failure doesnt mean to give up but to rather keep trying to improve the ratio of failing to succeding. Cars may be important now, but in an alternate universe, what if they were never invented?

In conclusion these familes who are giving up their main source of transportation unless required, they are doing the right thing by taking the first step into a new way of life. Giving up cars is giving up the chance to accidentally hurt those by made a bad desicion. Althought depleting these choices of actions will or should decrease if this topic remains to be included as a new trend for a lack of better word majorly helpful to whose with crime records of the possibility of earning. Fighting with reason is better than to not fight at all. If your standing and doing nothing to help the environment around you, then don't you think you should consider the consequences for future generations down the road? Consider both sides of the argument, which is right or which is wrong to proceed with? The happier life versus the hurting of the world? I can only do nothing but act upon myself to show that what is going on is a coincidence merely to the fact that you are here reading my words. Can my words help from afar or not at all can only be determined by yourself.

So be wise and consider, do you chose left for healing or right for hurting?",2,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0
""" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markests didn't get to see the candidates at all.""-Bradford Plumer. Are society is relaying on this electoral college system, when we don't even know who are those electors. I agree, that we should change our election to a popular vote because people get often confuse to whom their voting for, and it might lead to picking the wrong person that would be helping leading this country. On the other hand, the people that agree on keeping the electoral college system say that "" when you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" The majoredy of citizens don't even  know who their voting for, imagine their going to be more lost and eventually ending up voting for the wrong person. The electoral college should be remove for good which will allows to have a stable society.

The Electoral college dosen't allow the candidates to come and visit the states. So, you don't even now who you're voting for."" In 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" What's the point of having privileges to vote, when the segregationist who elect electors are against the president you voted for. What's happen to having free rights, and be able to vote for who you want, and  knowing that he or she would suceed and  lead our country to the right path. By having the electoral college system it is getting rid of those rights. Also the ""2000 fiasco"" was known as the biggest problems we had in the century. Are goal is improving our country not deteriorating it. If we change our election to a popular vote we wouldn't even be in this mess.

Citizen who agree on keeping the electoral college system say that ""electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012's election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states."" What wrong with all the states? Are we not part of this country to? Their focusing all their attention on the states that they would be recieving their votes from. Their not even giving other states an opportunity of getting to know their candidates and what their offering to are country on improving it. Another, example is that the electoral college votes relay on larger states. They do that because they know that all their votes are going to come from the bigger states but that's incorrect they should relay on the whole country completely of getting their votes from.

"Imagine being in a classroom that moniters your every emotion, where even if you are paying attention, the teacher would think you are not. For students, this would be a tough world to live in. In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the auther Nick D'Alto writes in a way that gives an impression that the Facial Acting Coding System is perfect; however, the truth is far from it.

The author makes a series of points to show why this Facial Action Coding System would work well, and its many uses in a classroom. On the other hand, the author does not address the Facial Action Coding System's shortcomings. In the first paragraph, the author says that the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The question arises: how is it possible to be happy and angry at the same time? Machines can not, and will never be able to understand a human mind, and a human heart. Students in classrooms will not appreciate this technology because it will convey emotions differenct from what the students are actually going through.

In paragraph 3, the author describes how the machine picks up on emotions of people. The author says that he has classified six basic emotions. However, there are a vast majority of emotions that are not included in the Facial Acting Coding System. For example, what would the results looks like if someone feels jealous? Furthermore, the author says the emotions are associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.Therefore, the results would be squewed if one or more of the facial muscles are used to express two completely different emotions. Students could be accused of being sad, while in actuality, they are just tired.

In paragraph 4, the author says that even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the facial expressions for each emotion are universal. Again, the Coding System only uses 6 emotions, so it can not be accurate. The author also says that the software can identify mixed emotions, but fear and happiness can not be mixed emotions. Hence, the Facial Action Coding System is not accurate.

In paragraph 5, the athor says that humans would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happiness. This is because humans don't assume what a person is thinking, but the Facial Acting Coding System will and since the system will not be accurate, it could wrongly accuse an innocent person of an emotion.

Paragraph 6 talks about computers being able to understand emotional communication, while paragraphs 7 and 8, shows us how to encode a smile. By following the three steps given, it is farely easy to fake what the machine would think is a genuine smile. Computers may be able to read certain emotions, but humans can always outsmart them. The Facial Action Coding System is going to be a huge waste of money if it is employed in schools because students will find ways to deceive the system.

Lastly, paragraph 9 tells us that humans unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. With that being said, if someone shows a certain emotion, people that see that emotion would imitate it. This further skews the results of the Facial Action Coding System.

The Facial Action Coding System is simply not accurate; it does not cover a wide range of emotions and it can simply be deceived. Furthermore, students would unconsciously imitate other students, which would the Facial Action Coding System would interpret as an emotion. Hence, there is no value in using the Facial Action Coding Sytem to read students' emotional expressions.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"In the atricle, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it addresses the idea of driverless cars. I believe that humans should stay in control of the road, it has worked this far, why can't it continue working? For one, it is not equipped with the common since of a human, it cannot fuction with tough traffic mishaps. Secondly, the computers may malfuction, and they could cause a lot of damage.

There are a lot of issues with this car, firstly it has trouble dealing with complicated traffic issues, as seen in paragraph two. What if someone was driving on the interstate and fell asleep because the car was driving and the driver wasn't alerted going through roadwork? If someone died the driver would be responsible for the death. Or what if there was an accident? The car would keep going and bust through it, and it would be the drivers fault.

Another reason why it shouldn't be open to the public is because no computer is one hundred percent perfect. Computers always malfunction, they need to reboot sometimes, and othertimes they just quit working. I have been working on projects for English 10 before and my computer just shut off and I lost my whole project. It could happen with this, the car could reboot, or the computers could shut off and the driver could be asleep, and it shuts off. Causing a huge accident. How is this a good idea?

All in all, I would say that this isn't such a great idea. In the examples of not being able to deal with complicated traffic issues, and the computers malfuctioning, it just isn't a great idea. I believe humans should stay in control of the roads, it has worked this far, why can't it continue working?",2,3,0,1,0,1,1,0,0
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students is, in fact valuable. The Facial Action Coding System could be really beneficial toward students in many ways. For example, it could help students with their learning and comprehending abilities. Many students have a hard time understanding the lessions, whether it is because of a learning disability or they just simply dont understand something. It could even help the teachers asess how well their students are comprehending the material being taught.

One reason that I am for the use of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System) in schools is because I think that it would work well amoung a teachers side. Now a teacher has a great amount of responsibility; they have to teach the students, make sure they grasp and really understand what is being taught and then if they do not understand it they have to come up with an alturnitive way to get them to understand what was taught. Now, what if it is more than one student who does not understand, the teacher has to keep in mind that not everyone learns and percieves information the same way. The FACS woud adapt to a students specific learning style; by their facial muscles and it could really be benefical.

Also in this era, which is the technological era, a lot of school and homework is done online, so with this new computer system it would make homework and school lessions a whole lot easier for both the students, teachers and even the parents. It would be benefical to have that new technology on computers because you will not have a teacher at home with you when you are trying to complete the homework that was assigned. But with the FACS it could recognize when the they are confused and even bored, because lets face it, we all have become bored while doing homework.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is in fact very valuable. Not only students but teachers as well, could really benefit a whole lot from just having this technological system available for them. Alot could happen just from the FACS reading the students facial expressions.",3,4,0,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Driverless cars are a sign of laziness, driving is one thing that I believe drivers should have to do. Individuals can not have everything handed down to them, driveless cars should not be legal. The cars would be in better control of us than we are with them!

Cars that do not have to be driven by humans should not be allowed, every car that is seen on the road should have to have a driver behind the wheel at all times, not just sometimes but all of the time. The law focuses on keeping drivers safe ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe."" The law of driving has to be safe for individuals to make it to their destinations, if the car companies put driveless cars out on the road that could be a risky move. Cars are meant to have drivers behind the wheel at all time. In many states ""it is illegal to even to test computer-driven cars."" I agree with it being illegal one hundred percent, if it is illegal to even test driverless cars in some states then it should be illegal in all states as well, the roads will continue to be a lot safer without the cars that have drivers not focused on the wheel.

There could be so many problems with the driverless cars ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumpton that the problems ahead will be solved."" Computer driven cars could have so many problems, there are so many what ifs. The cars computer system could stop working which then could shut the whole car down, you would then have a car that is not fuctionable, which is not safe for you or other individuals traveling. We used to not have the technology to even be able to do this back in 2000 ""The sensors weren't there, the computers weren't there, and the mapping wasn't there. Individual had gotten by without the driverless cars so I think we could get by too. The need of having cars that do all the work for us is a sign of laziness and I do not agree with it.

The models of these cars are also using destracting technologies, because individuals will become bored while waiting to drive, it would be a challenge to sit and wait to drive while your car is doing all the work. Dr Werner Huber, a BMW project manager states ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way, some manufactures hope to do that by bringing in car entertaiment and information systems that use heads up displays.'' Even though these displays can shut of instantly when and if the driver needs to take over makes it even more risky. These designs are meant to entertain you while you sit and wait for your turn, but they are really just new destractful ways for the road. Driving is already dangerous, but adding new entertainment devices make the roads even more dangerous. If an individual is in the middle of being entertained they aren't just going to quit what they are doing which could cause an accident that didn't have to occur. Now while the driver watches the road or is attempting to watch, the car will aslo watch the driver, ""using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road."" Drivers could become more destracted, focusing more on the camera and what is tapping rather then the watching the road, which could also cause an accident that isn't neccessary.

Driverless cars are not a good idea, they will cause limitless destractions that will just make the roads more dangerous. Our cars that we control are better off than the automobiles that we don't. Cars are meant to have a controler and with the driverless cars the car would be controlling us. Let's not cause more of a risk for drivers then what there already is, safety is important and with these cars safety is not guranteed.",4,4,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Driveless cars are one of the most talked about upcoimg advancements in modern technology. These cars are efficent for the driver, as well as the enviorment. Although some don't have the greatest eye appeal, the Tesla model S, for instance, has a clean and luxury look to it. Even though these cars are tremendesly positive in the aspect of a driveless car, their is most definetly drawbacks. However, the pros outways the cons by a wide margin.

These cars could change the way people all around the world commute and travel. A long car ride across country can be just as easy as sitting there and enjoying the ride. Gas prices are a major issue in our econemy. During the reccession in 2007, gas prices got to as high as 4.00$! These driveless cars are ran by Electricity, and some are even toying with the idea of using solar power.

A younger male lands a new job he wanted, so he goes out with friends to celebrate. This male has a couple drinks and is just barely under the legal limit to drive. He isnt responsible and thinks he can drive home. He's not only putting his life in danger, but other peoples lives as well. What if this same male owned a driveless car that drove itself 90 percent? The odds of him getting in a wreck go down dramatically and could potentially save many peoples lives.

Although, with everything its not always perfect. I am a big supported of the driveless car, but i will be the first to admit there is some drawbacks and worries. On a long trip or early morning drive to work what if the driver falls asleep at the wheel and an emergency occurs were the driver would have to take over? Would the vibration in the seat be enough to wake this slumbering person up? Suppose there is a white out condition were the sensors and cameras cant recognize a thing and malfunction. Will the car be able to tell the roads are too slick to go 70MPH on the interstate? Also suppose its driving in a highly populated downtown area. All the diffrent variables it would have to be prepared for. People and little kids walking in the street, crosswalks, people biking along side the road, construction sites, is just to name a few things.

However, I believe Driveless cars are coming, there will be some dropbacks, there will be some figuring out to do. All-in-all its a terrific idea and i think itll change the world and the transit system as we know it. Cars are just the start. Could Aircrafts be next? Maybe, what is to stop us from finding out.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1
"My postion on driverless cars, is that it is a great idea that somwonw created.

There are some how ideas that are stilll being thought of and created.

Things are still be deveploed and have not come out yet until 2020.

What Google is trying to do is, make it to where no one has to drive anymore in the future.

Google did make a somewhat of a driveless car but you would nees to take control of the car when you pull and out of the driveway, or dealing with complicated traffic issues.

They thougt tha making a driveless car was not just only the car but also making a smart road as well.

The road worked very well but there would then that would mean massive upgrades to all the roads.

In 2013, BMW annouces the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" the car could only handle a scernt amount of speed under traffic, but sersonrs make sure that the drivers hand is still on the wheel.

Which in that case means that the driver is stilll going to have their eyes on the road.

The google car would just announce when to take over the car.

In the result to the driverless car, laws are starting to be made on the safty of the car.

In most states it is illegal to test computer driven cars.

Laws will soon be needed to cover tecnology fails if somonw was to get hurt.

Who is at fault, the driver or the manufacturer.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Imagine your life if cars did not exist. You may dread the thought of living without them. Some people likely think it would be a hassle to get where you need to go, but it does not have to be. Other people may love the idea of a car-free life. Believe it or not, lowering the usage of cars has many advantages.

Vauban, Germany is a community that has given up their cars. The streets are car-free -- except for the where the tram runs. The residents might hear a car motor from the distance, and that is only when the pleasant sounds of wandering children and bicycle riders are not blocking out that noise. The people of this community live their lives healthier and with less stress from getting more excercise. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" says a media trainer and mother of two living in Vauban.

Over the past two decades, there have been many efforts to make cities better for walking, now planners use that same concept in suburbs. This approach places stores on a main street within walking distance rather than in large malls on a far-off highway. Transportation for America promotes new communities where people would be less dependent on cars. David Goldberg, an official from Transportation for America, says that since World War II, all of humans' development has been centered on the car. Mr. Goldberg believes this development will have to change and people will have to reduce their usage of cars.

On top of being a healthier population, cutting out cars would decrease the amount of air pollution. Transportation is one of the largest sources of carbon emission into the environment. In 2014, Paris had to create certain bans on driving in an effort to clear their air of smog. Paris usually has more smog than other capitals in Europe, and has even rivaled the amount of smog in Beijing, China, which is one of the most polluted cities in the world. Bogota, Columbia has made their own efforts to  lower the amounts of pollution. The people of Bogota created a program in which people hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to get where they needed to go during a car-free day. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said a businessman by the name of Carlos Arturo Plaza.

Many individual cities have tried in their own ways to decrease the percentage of car usage in their population. Whether it be a car-free day, carpooling, or just people buying fewer cars, all efforts help decrease pollution, stress, and many other bad things. Traveling without a car brings many benefits to a person, their family, their community, and even the world as a whole.",2,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,3
"Cars are a very good tool for getting from one location to the next, but the gas and diesel that powers some cars is producing a greenhouse gas that is polluting our air.

Elizabeth Rosenthal , speak about how cars are effecting our lives, and polluting our air. The advantages of limiting car usage would help decrease, or even eliminate greenhouse gases.

By temporarily banning the usage of cars, Paris, France succesfully decreased the thick smog that had built around their city. According to source 2, by

Robert Duffer , ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates where ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" Because of this sucessful temporary ban from Paris, by Monday the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescide the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday, according to

Robert Duffer.

In Bogota, Colombia, home to 7 million, has a ""program thats set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city errily devioid of traffic jams."" According to source 3, by

Andrew Selsky.

It has been three straight years that cars have been banned with only busses and taxis permitted for the

Day Without Cars , the goal of this program is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. Violators of this program would be facing a $25 fine. The turnout of this program is large, even throughout rainfall. ""It's a good oppertunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman

Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a bicycle with his wife.

In some places, such as Vauban, Germany, have given up their cars. ""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden in this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg, near the French and Swiss boarders. The streets of this upscale community are completely

""Car Free""

- except for the main thoroughfare, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Car ownership is allowed, but there is only two places to park- large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000 along with a home. 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars, and 57% sold their car to move there.

All around the world there is appearently issues with air pollution because of the cars that residents of those places own. There are many programs in place, such as the temporary ban of cars in Paris, France, and the

Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia. The efforts of these programs have not gone to waste, because there has been a significant decrease in smog and air pollution in these places. Hopefully in the future there will be many more programs like these to lower air pollution and save our Earth.",2,3,3,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Dear State Senator,

Have you ever noticed when you look at the votes, The popular votes is more accutate and used more than the Elector college votes?

When you gather up all the populare votes, Usally one canidate has more popular votes,

But when it came time for the election , The canidate that had the most popular votes didn't win at all.

Like in 2000, When Gore had more popular votes than Bush, Yet fewer electoral votes,

But that was the first time since 1888.

(pgh 2 lines 4 of In Defense of the Electoral College)

You have to think when the people vote, Their not the ones who are really making a choice in the electoral college.

It is the electors who elect the president, Not the people.

When you vote for a presidental candidate you're actully voting for a slate if electors.

(pgh 1 lines 3 In Defense of the Electoral College)

Yes some people are aware that the Electoral College was established by our founding fathers but they also state the constitution ect. can be changed as the country grows and changes.

Whith elector college Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.

(pgh 5 lines 1 in what is the electoral college)

Meaning all the people in your state which is usally alot, all those votes are only represented by a couple of electors from your state vs. that with all the people of your state with indiviual votes.

sounds pretty rediculas.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidental candidate.

(pgh 7 lines 1 in Wat is the electoral college)

Which some times isn't the best idea.

Ober 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.

This year voters can expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again lose the presidencey.

And yet, the electoral college still has its defenders. what gives?...

(pgh 1 lines3-5 in why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong)

Whats wrong with electoral college system is voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors , who in turn elect the president.

Again the people sadly do not have a choice indiviually for who they want.

Alot of times voters get confused in this and just give up voting all together.

Some people ask, Can voters control whom their electors vote for?

Not always.

Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate?

Some times,Because they get really confused with how things are.

People have been arguing this situation for a long time now yet electoral college is still in place.

Who knows maybe you and the other senators might decied to try to go with the popular vote some say.

Thank you for your time.

"In introduction, NASA and Scientist are trying to get information about venus. They already try landing meachin but it only last an hour. So they have to do something about it to test if human would be able to live in venus. NASA and Scientist believe that there use to be life in venus because of the feature, like mountain, vally and other. So NASA and Scientist are still planning on something else.

First, according to the text venus is sometime called the evening star, and is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Scientist say that this nickname is misleading becasue venus is a planet. Venus is the second away from the sun, which mean it really hot. Mars is the first one but according to the text venus is the hottest of all of them, hotter then the mars. Venus is often referred to as earth's twin because it the closest planet to the earth, in size and density.

Second, all of the planet move at different speed so something earth a closer to mars than venus. The most challenging part for NASA and Scientist is studying the planet, at the same time it the most important part os the mission. Their mission is to see and test venus if human can live in it. They already try sending meachin but it only last one hour so that was a bummer. According to the text the most challening part of it is the cloud of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere. The other challeng is in venus the average temperatures is over 800 degrees fahrenheit.

Thrid, NASA possible slolution is to allow Scientists to float above the fray, which mean it like car hovering 30 miles above the surface. The temperatures would still be around 170 degrees fahrenheit inside, Scientist will be able to live according to the text. All the researchers can do is look around and write it down on paper since they cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, but it is safe from creature if there is any. Somehow someone would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. According to the text, NASA and Scientist can also build another meachin that would be able to go to venus and come back with samples. Nowaday computer need electronics but this computer from 1800s dont need electronics and was played an important role in the 1940s during world war 2. According to the text, these devices make calculations by using gear and levers, and tend to be more stonger when it come to extreme physical conditions.

Inconclution, NASA and Scientist are trying to find away for human to visit the ""earth twin"" (venus). They have try alot of way but none of them work so now they are trying to use computer from 1800s with extreme physical conditions to get some samples from venus to study. I hope it work too, who doesn't want to visit the earth twin (venus), will there be alien. According to the text, modern computer are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick but weaker in extreme physical conditions. All in all venus is planet that is consider as earth twin, and Scientist believe that there use to be grass, tree and other, but it too hot so they all died.",3,2,2,2,0,0,1,0,0
"Is it a really a good thing to read someone emotions? well it is, if you see someone who's mad, sad, fearful, you can help them to calm down, to feel better, or to feel less scare. emotions really lets someone to show everyone how they feel. But using the Facial Action Coding System (or FACS) on classroom full with students could be a good/bad idea. One teachers can see if students are confuse or lost, two they see if there's something wrong with one of the students, three some students don't want their's teachers to be in their's problems.

Before I explain more about why it's a good idea for teachers, I want to talk about how i feel about FACS. It something that i never heard about and i think it's somewhat a good idea, but i dont recommaning it to put it in a A.I. It would get a bit weird and creepy if it's in a robot, but that's how i feel about it. Back to the topic, if a teacher is given out a lesson and some students don't get it they use the FACS to see if they get it or don't. They can even use it as they teach and see what they in to work on long until they understand the lessons or topics.

You know how some teachers would ask the class how are they doing before they start the lesson? well there are some teachers who don't ask that but do care for their's students. If they use the FACS before they start class and see someone depress or sad they can wirte their names down on a note or peice of paper and after class or school they talk to them one on one to see whats wrong or if there ok. they can even try to help them or make them feel better.

There are some students who need help or need to talk with someone, but they chose not to get help because they feel like it's gonna make it worst for them. I know some people who really need some help but they dont want to get help, but we had they FACS in my school they get help faster. than again they would get mad with teachers fast becuase they don't teachers to help them with their problems.

Thats what's I got to say about the FACS being a classroom. It would be really helpfull for teachers, but some students would be annoy by it easily or would think that teachers are trying to be apart of there personal lives.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What could go wrong? A lot can go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we could be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We can't let technology over rule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless cars. Soon cars will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In todays world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let cars start driving themselves we could get laszy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless cars on the rise this could get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the car didn't do what it was suppose to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of qestions and concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This is good. Their are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most cases. They know how to take control.

The practice of driveless cars are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They care about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are cars that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car is a smart car. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assitance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to rememeber who exactly is in charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless cars come in to existance.",2,3,2,1,0,1,1,1,1

I got to travel a lot to. So here is why I am asking you to join the program just like I did.

I know you probaby won't do it but I am just going to try my best to convince you so the first reason is since the (UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.) That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters. Another reason you should join is because you get to travel all kinds of places in the world ( Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China.

If each galaxy has 1 planet with similar conditions to that of Earth, and they all had life forms on them that are presumeably far more advanced than that of humans, the sky above us wouldn't really be visible, as spaceships would be flying around it all the time. NASA has tried communicating with aliens. They have failed because aliens don't exist. Therefore, aliens and moon Nazis do not exist and cannot create statues or anything else as they are fake. The face is a natural made Martian landmark, and Martian is just a term used to refer to something that is related to Mars. As you can see,the Face is just another rock on Mars.",1,4,1,1,1,2,3,1,2
"Hello everything i am PROPER_NAME we will be start talking about how technology should not be used in today's work as right now.

So I will be explaining why first then secondly after that i going to be talking about reaons . Okay I yall enjoy this paragraph i written it from my head put alot of compassion inside of this.

Alright so why should student's should be allowed to have technology.Okay so there is many reasons why i think we should have alittle of technology in our time as right now.But most importantly the resources that we will be able to use for information.To find good article facts about a pacfific topic on a good reseach.Why dose 95 % of the world use technology for because of social media if social media wasn't even alive right now there would be no more usage of the devices that the world have as our time today.But most people don't realize that not having technology now days could have impacted Amercian's too be more worried about there love ones.Althought people could just use not alot of the usage of phones and laptop's and computers etc. This time of age little kids even use more technology than adults do just because of the games have been made on the devices.The reason why people use much technology cause now days there are more outbreaks on social media like how billy Graham died they sent a whole tweet about it the news got big on social media. I can see why half of the reaons why people use technology much as for there work and jobs they have to look up research about stuff ordering different types of things so they can have the right enought things that they wanted to get on a website.But most people don't realize you can just do that and also not use as much technology most kid's don't even interact with one another they always text there friends on a apps like snapchat ,instagram facebook and including messager on apple phones and samsung phone's .They just text there friend's and say you want hang out at my house but they don't realize half of Amercians don't get there home work done in school just because of the technology we have now day's half of school in my class be on there phone 24/7 they don't even pay any attention to most of the teachers that trying to benefit them to have a nice good decent edcuation and including how they listen to music while a teacher trying to get there attention to answer a question that we a learning in class so i think people should not be allowed to have technoloy in school or out of school.

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. Throughout the reading he talks about how it'll put an impact on daily driving and how modern day cars will be self driving and automatic. In 2009 Google had made a vehicle that'd support the idea of self driving vehicles by creating and designing one himself.

The positives and negatives of being able to own one of these vehicles or being able to have the oppurtunity of them being manuafactured throughout the United States or other countries could have an impact on the world itself. In paragraph one it stated that Google cofounder Sergey Brin had envisions of public transportation systems where fleets of driverless cars became the new form of taxi transportation. The vehicles he foresees would use half of the fuel of todays transportational vehicles. What that means is that the environment around you would have less smog and less toxins in the air. With that being said it could dramatically change how people would be able to get to work everyday. Instead of using a bus and waiting for the stop it'll open up another door for them to use the cars that are self driven and that could be more effeciant with the time of them arriving to their destination.

Now,we will be discussing the negatives of having the cars built. The cost of the technology that needs to be put inside of each cars could cost more than the actually shell itself. If it uses an amazing amount of wiring and sensors then they will also run into electric problems and the hassal of spending all of the time and money on one car. With the gps reciever,four automotive radar sensors,a video camera that is installed near the rearview mirror,and many other things that are needed to even start the ""self driving program"" just isn't worth it in my opinion. The system will always have a flaw and so will humans. But humans have the skill of being able to get out of sticky situations. The computers inside of the car won't be able to sense all of the risks on the local street or on the highway compared to a humans abilitys and sight. The computers on the vehicle only examine the surroundings and the speed. But how close is soon? An accident could be avoided in most cases because of manual driving. Having a computer that is only set to go a certain speed and to use just the programs on it to avoid certain things isn't worth the time of a regular driver.

In conclusion,I myself would not purchase a vehicle that is assisted and needs all of the technology of doing something that I could do independently. It is a very vague opinion on my part but to me it is a fair share of laziness and the inability to drive a vehicle with basic knowledge.",3,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"A with less cars would be a better world because people would not emit as much harmful gas to distroy the o-zone. the two reasons the world would be better without cars are people would walk more which means that people would get more exersice. the other reason that it would be better to have a world with less cars is people would spend less money on cars and gas.

The first reason it would be a better world without cars is that people would walk more and the people that walk would get more exersice and be healthier. the other reason it would be better to walk is that people that have anger and stress problems would not have to be stuck in traffic and would not get angry over people doing stuff to them wen they'er in traffic and people who get stressed would not have to worry about people running into them or people cutting them off. the last reason that it would be better for people to walk is that people would be healthier because they would not have all the fumes from the cars in thier face and would not be inhaling it so they not have lung problems in the futer because they were breathing the fumes.

The second reason it would be better world with out cars is that people would spend less money on gas which means that people wuld have more money for other things. also if people didn't spend money on gas and cars is people would not have to make car payments so they wouldn't stress about not having enough money to pay the car payment or the car getting reposesed. the last reason it would be better to not spend money on cars and gas is if people didn't spend money on that stuff they would be able to spend money on running shoes so when they walk to work or whereever they are going they can wear the proper shoes.

In a world with less cars people would be so much better off because of all the things they don't have to spend money on. also the world would not get as damaged because of all the things cars emit.",1,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,1
"Driverless cars are coming. The futuristic design is extrodinary. Using a computer and satelite to navigate its surroundings. This computer has multiple sensors around the car for different things. For one thing, I am for the cars of the future.

Reason one is because they can navigate traffic jams so you don't even have to worry bout them. One bad this though is they arent completely driverless because the drive has to remain aware in case of road work or an accident where the AI of the car would not be able to compute this at the given time.

Reason two is the functionality of it. It will save our air and reduce the consumption of gas used by taxis. Public transportation will be a thing of the past if these cars are used.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a great benefit to everyone. The envvironment would benefit the most because of the fuel reduction and the air would be a little bit cleaner. There would be less accidents due to texting and driving. All in all, driverless cars are great and the laws need to see that.",1,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,0
"My opinion on driverless cars is that i dont think they should be legal, because they are driverless and they don't have control from other drivers, such as a instructor or someone that can control it, Another resason i dont think they should be allowed is that they might cause a lot of accidents. Some accidents could be harful others might be just a dent or

something like that.

In the passage it was talking about how the law keeps focus on the drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe. If they focus so hard on that, the driverless cares wouldn't be okay, because the people safe they would need someone to pay attention to the road and not the distracting suff. If people were distracted while in a driverless car... How would they know when something is coming or their about to crash (besides the seat vibration)?

In my opionion driverless vehicles shouldn't be allowed due to the fact that no one is driving them, and that they could be a harm on other people. I think when driving these vehicles someone should still pay attention to the road even if they are working on something bad, such as a report for a job or anything like that. some people might think differently, but some might not. Some people might think that they need to have someone watching the roads. Some other people may think they don't need anyone watching the road, and etc. Finally I think they should be allowed if they have someone at least paying attention to the road, and etc.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"This Facial Action Coding System could be good in a couple ways but its unnecessary. Computers might know what your emotions and help in a couple ways to know if you're confused about something or do not like something you see on the internet. Just because you look at someones face, it doesn't mean that they feel some type of way. Someone could be smiling or laughing but that doesn't mean that they are truely happy. It's the same thing by having a serious face.

A face expression doesn't always show someone's emotions. Other people do not care about other people's emotions. It's better to notice things with your own eyes than a computer or machine to tell you how somebody is ""feeling"". The article says you can tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. That's true because you know that person very well.

People do want to hide their emotions for their own specific reason. We all have that moment when we would want to keep our feelings to ourselves. We wouldn't like for systems to know our emotions.",1,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Have you ever heard of a driverless car? Well Google has had some cars that can drive themselves since 2009. The cars they made have drove more than half a million miles without crashing. The driver still has to back out the driveways and go around traffic issues like other car crashes or roadblocks, but other than that the car will drive on its own. I think these cars would be useful when the driver wouldn't feel like driving.

First off, I think these cars would be useful because what if you don't feel like driving and you don't have anybody with you that can drive the driverless car would be perfect to have in that kind of situation. Yes sometimes the driver would want to drive so thats why they have a heads-up display. When thats turned off the driver would be in control until they turn it back on. Another reason why a driver would want a driverless car is because what if the driver wants to text a person back and they can't use one hand to type they could make the car drive itself so they could that. So that's why some drivers would want to have a driveless car sometimes.

Yes the driverless car would be useful when the driver wouldn't feel like driving. However the car could still crash if your not paying good attention to it and also the law could see that your hands isn't on the wheel. Another reason is that there could be an accident with the driverless car and the law wouldn't know who to blame the driver or the car manufacturer.",1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"""The Face on Mars"". Many pepole think that its more than what it is. They think that we're hiding something. That maybe what we found was something that we didn't want you to know. However, I can assure you that if their was anything going on in the solar system, that we would tell you because, well thats our job. Our job is to analyze the solar system and keep the public informed on anything that is happening outside of earth that normal citizens couldn't see for themselves. If their was life or anything else on the moon of Mars we would have seen it by now. Also, we would benefit from their being something special about the moon of Mars. Another thing believe it or not we wouldn't keep something that could change the way that we live to ourselves.

We would have seen something extrodinary by now. The picture that was taken in April of 2001 would have shown you anything else that sat nearby ""The Face"". Also in an earlier picture they determined that the mouth, nose, and eyes on ""The Face"" were shadows. They were not built into a structure the way that they would have been if indeed the structure was built by other forms of life. This also just popped up, if say someone or somethign did build it then it would have progressed. It wouldn't have just came to in one of our pictures. However, if say an asteroid had hit the planet, then it could have caused the same thing that had happened here.

On another note, anyone that knows anything about NASA knows that we get funding from the government. When we get funded from the government obviously they need people to check things out. The people that check things out are obviously going to get paid because that is their job. So if we're going to get paid more and more money to try to find life on the moon of mars then why wouldn't we want their to be life on the moon. The funding that NASA gets isn't little. Some people would have the oppertunity to make allot of money. It would also give NASA a chance to get people interested in what they do for a living.

The whole point of our jobs is to go to school to learn how to see things that happen in space beyond what we already know. We want to help and make a difference and keep people informed on what else is out there. So if we found something again we would want you all to know about it because we could teach you something. So many people think that our job is stupid and useless because all we do is stare at the stars. This would be a good way to show everyone that what we do is real. We really do see things that the rest of the world didn't know about. Most kids don't want to be an astronomer anymore they want to be doctors or lawyers. So showing them that what we do is important would be a good thing for the kids. We alll want whats good for the kids so why wouldn't we tell them?

Life on the moon of Mars. It sounds plausable. It sounds amazing. So many good things could come from the fact that there is life on mars that it is unreal. However I can assure you that there is nothing there. ""The Face on Mars"", it's just a natural land formation that we took a picture of over the years. Nothing more , nothing less.",3,4,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Venus is the closest planet to Earth and one of the brightest points in a dark sky.

Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus has proved it is very challenging to get data from the planet. The biggest question with Venus is it worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Astronomers should try to get more data because it imbodys Earth more than any other planet.

Venus has features that are very simurlar to those on Earth. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.""

It shows that Venus is very a like to Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had new and safe ideas so that we can still reserch Venus even with the dangers.

They want to floaut above the fray.

Wouldn't be easy conditions, but not hard enough to kill humans.

Now you know how dangers and worthy the explorion on Venus would be. But you sholudn't let a little fear get in the way of the fun and Knowlege on getting.

Wanting to do the challege on Venus has value, has dangers, and doubts but what are you scarred of you'll die any way.",1,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"The Face that appeared on Mars was something that all of us would never forget. We didn't know how it appeared or why it appeared, but we were going to figure it out. Some scientist including me think it was just a natural landform. Other scientist think it was created by aliens,but I highly doubt it was.

I'm here working with one of the other scientist, and we're talking about the Face that appeared on Mars. The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform.

It was a natural landform because the caption that we put for people to see was "" huge rock formation..... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The face was just a rock formation that gave the illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth becuse it was just a shadow that we were seeing.

However the scientist doesn't think that. He thinks that the face was made by aliens. He says that there is no way it was just a natural landform that aliens made this as a sign for something.

He believes that it was a sign for something that the aliens were going to end up doing. But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But of course not everyone was satisfied.

It was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

I think even though some people still may think it was made by aliens, we all know that it is just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens.

I after all did convince the scientist that I was working with, that the Face was just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens . But all we have to do now is to convince everyone else that it was just a natural landform. I believe that the Face is just a landform because of so many reasons. So what do you think?

Do you think it was just a natural landform or it was made by aliens?",2,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The suggestions of the auther studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well backed up by alot of inforamtion and knoweldge about Venus . Venus being so close to almost being the same as Earth is why studying the planet isn't a bad idea . Astronomers are eager to study or learn more about Venus is because the planet may be well once have been the most Earth like planet in the solar system . Scientist believe that long ago Venus was proably cover by some features that Earth has . The features from having surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys , mountains , and craters .

Although Venus is intresting to study or learn about is pretty amazing , it is not as easy as you think it is . Venus can be really dangerous . Venus being so close to Earth sometimes , humans have sent numerous spacecraft to our sister planet known as Venus . Reportedly that even though many spacecrafts have been sent to Venus no spacecraft has survived the landing . This may be the reason why it is not very safe for humans. Venus atmophere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide . There is more dangerous elements in venus like atmophere .The cloud are highly of corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmophere . The temperture can be a danger in the fact that the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit . Also the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what people experieance in Earth . Venus has teh hottest surface tempereture of any planet in our solar system .

There has been many ideas of to get a spacecraft to Venus safely , one of those ideas is to float above the fray of Venus . However peering at Venus from a spaceship orbiting or huver the planet safely is only going to give scienttsit the the features of only limited insight on the groung or the surface of Venus . Scientist thinks hovering or floating around Venus fray is not really a good study is because they cannot get smaples of rocks , gas , or anything else from that far of a distance . There has been many approaches when it comes to visting our sister planet , one example is the mechanical computers . This device was fisrt envisioned in the 1800s and played an imporatant rle in the 1940s during the World War II . Although these ideas may not be proven to work the curiosity will continue later on.

One day the knowledge and information scientist already have of Venus will be the the reason there is going to be a possible solution of getting to our sister planet safely . From the value of Venus not only because human curiosity will likely lead the human kind to many other intimindiating endeavors . Risks will be made for the human kind to visit our sister planet , Despite the danger , Venus is should be a worthy pursuit of studies .",3,2,2,2,0,1,0,1,0
"The date is May 24, 2001 and twenty-five years ago we found something that left both NASA and I speechless. They say that this face was created by Aliens however they are totally wrong. NASA says otherwise that it's just natural landform. The most logical reason is the natural landform, because we haven't had any evidence of aliens being real. Therefore I argue that its just a natural landform and not in any form made by an alien.

First of all, we have no proof of aliens whatsoever. No one has proved that they exist, or that they are real. So why do they think its aliens, when it could've just been a natural landform. Things like these happen all the time, our Earth just happens to make things like these. People are actually beliveing that aliens are real, when really they don't have proof.

Second of all, how would the aliens know how to create it. If to say if they even are real. How would they create it, there aren't any tools on Mars. They wouldn't know what they were making, they would have no idea. The face just happened to be a natural landform, it was not created by aliens. Along with they have no proof ""aliens"" did this.

Third of all, why would they even do this. If they did happen to do it , they didn't even mean too. Because they haven't seen a face so they wouldn't know how to make it. Aliens are not real, if they were it'd be everywhere all over the news. People would be so excited and although going to space is a risk many people would do it. Just to go see the ""aliens"", but no one has proved they are real. Therefore, NASA will stand correctly. The face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA is correct. There is no proof of aliens, and even if there was the slightest chance to having proof. Aliens wouldn't even have meant to do it. They have never seen a face, so why would they just do this. Natural landforms happen all the time. But this one just happened to be spotted by NASA. NASA always seems to be correct on their stats because they do so much research, unlike the other who just suggest that its an alien. I'd like to see you do as much research as NASA and give me proof of aliens, then we'll believe you.",2,4,1,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Are you confused, angry, or sad? What if a computer could help you understand more to take away your confusion. Technology has been advancing little by little and we are at the point in time where a computer is now able to read your face and emotions. Two professers have been working hard to create a new software that can recognize emotions. They are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

The use of technology in the classroom is huge. Most students are now learning lessons planned by their techers' via laptops and etc. Sometimes students struggle to comprehend their teahcer's lessons and tend to be confused because of the way they are taught. Every student learns a different way and sometimes the teacher runs out of options to help the student understand. Now, computers have a different mind. They are more ""intelligent"" than humans. They can program different things for different people. This new software could be very valubale in a classroom because it can help explain things in ways that a teacher can't and will be able to adjust to the students comprehension.

Math can be a very stressful and difficult subject to comprehend. Sometimes teachers cant explain how to solve an equation easily which is how computers could help do those things. If you're reading through your teachers lesson and see his/her explanation on how to solve but you don't quite understand it, you tend to make a face of confusion. The computer may read that and see that you are having difficulty understanding the issue and may make the work easier for you to understand.

Last but not least, some student's tend to get frustrated or annoyed and decide to give up. A student giving up is not a good thing because they then don't learn what they were meant to learn. The computer may notice that a child is getting annoyed or upset and can find a different more fun and entertaining way to help the student. Just a simple change in the form of the lesson may give a student motivation to learn instead of quitting and giving up. Sometimes all a student needs is for something to be adjusted to their understanding and level.

This software created by two professers could be very valuable in a classroom. There are many benefits it could bring but there are some problems it could cause as well. Overall, this software will have a positive effect to help a child know they can be helped to understand what they dont. It could produce a new learning enviornment to the students comprehension and many test grades and etc could improve.",3,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,2
"Did you ever think about what it would be like to live on Mars, well would about Venus? I think that exploring Venus is a good idea and should be done. One of my reason for wanting to study Venus is that Venus has some simullar traits to Earth. Another reason that we should explore Venus is to learn about are surrounding planets and expaned on are space tecknology to explore furher into space.

I think that we should explore Venus is that it is the most like Earth than any other planet in are solar system. In the text it states that Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionaly the closest in distance too. The text also states that the panet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

I think that we should explore Venus to learn about are surrunding planets and expaned on are space tecknology to explore furher into space.. In the text it talks about how Venus is the closest and would help with space travel times. The text also talks about how Venus's atmosphere is almost 97 perecnt CO2 blankets. The text also talks about how they are looking into makeing a thing like a air blimp to float over the land about 30 miles high. The text also talks about them making a vehicle that can with stand the surface of Venus (which is around 800 degrees fahrenheit and enough air pressure to crush a submarine) for three weeks.

In conclusion I think that we should explore Venus more. For these reason of exploreing Venus for both its simuliays to Earth and for scientific space tecknology advances; I believe sending missions to Venus is important.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"The use of this techonology in the classroom is a phenomenal idea. Being able to identify facial expressions of students could be very beneficial to not only the student but also the teacher. This tecnology in the classroom would be an amazing thing for schools abroad as it may not only spark a level of interest and respect for technology by the student, but it may also create a much better learning evironment for all.

Technology, such as this, is an amazing thing to be able to use in your everyday learning experience. It will create a much deeper and more intuitive level of learning. Just as Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" a classroom computer would entail for a much more in depth learning experience. Often, students are afraid to admit if they do not understand something because of fear of being judged by a peer. With this technology, a teacher is able to see if the student understands it without the student having to face being ridiculed by others. Dr. Huang even noted, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The use of this teconology in the classroom will create a much better mutual relation and understanding between teacher and student, and will make it much easier for a teacher to properly prepare a student for an exam. Computers are the future and many universities are turning to them, so we need to take any chance we can get to use them to our advantage. Just as Dr. Huang was explaining, we understand that most communication is nonverbal, ""So computers need to understand that, too.""

Also, the use of this technology in the classroom may spark an interest of technology in the student. The of use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student is something that most students will not be able to get at home, as mentioned when the author describes how ""your home PC can't handle the complex algoorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" If we do not use this type of technology in the classrooms of our students, we are letting an opportunity go that most students may not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. The document even mentions how if an ad pops up and you smile then a similar add will appear again. However, if you frown, the next ad will be different. This can be applied to not only the reaction to adds, but the interest that a student experiences from his or her teacher's lesson plan. If the majority of students are intrigued by the lesson plan and they show a certain level of interest, then the teacher knows that his or her lesson plan is going to stick with the student better and less review will need to be done. On the other hand, if the student has very little interest then the teacher knows he or she needs to do better with that particular part of their teaching. If the teacher is able to fine-tune his teaching so it is better for the students, because of the new technology, it will make most students respect this type of technology much more. If it is better respected then the student is more likely to follow a career path or develop a passion involving techonology, which is needed since technology is forming our future generations.

As i have shown above with evidence and supporting statements, the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is priceless. It will give each student a better place to learn, and each teacher a better place to teach. It will also spark a much bigger interest and respect for technology, which is essential with how much technology influences our every day life. The use of this technology is vital.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I think you should join the ""Seagoing Cowboys"" because you can help others when there is a war and give them food. Luke signed up a program called the ""Seagoing Cowboys"". What they did was is take care of horses,young cows, and mules.

He didn't just want to help people he wanted the chance to see all those places he could see and when he join in the Seagoing Cowboys he had the chance.

"Dear, State senator

Voting is a public thing that happens every fourth year when a President is resining or cannidating for a second run. People all around the United States vote for a President they think can run the country the best. I think it's not fair that our votes are getting thrown away, and not even looked at. Bradform Plumer said that ""the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational (source 2 paragraph 14), and i think that is true. I think we should Bannish the Electoral College because it is a old process, unfair to Americans, and can lead to disasters.

The Electoral College is a very outdated process. Dont you think we should use a new one? The Elctorial College has been use since the 13 Colnies, and has been ignoring the public ever since. I think its only fair if we have a part in the president election. Also, if we could change it to popular vote, more people would be intact with politics. Bradford Plumer says that ""the eclection is only a few swing voters away from a catastrophe. (source 2 paragraph 12). I agree with him because the Electoral College is very old and can break at any time. I think its time that we change that and start fresh.

America's saying is ""home of the free, land of the brave""; well its not free if we cant vote for our president we want, and the government does it for us. Bradford Plumer says that the electorial college is unfair to voters, and candidtaes because of the winner takes all system (source 2 paragraph 13). The winner takes all system is states choosing if the are going to pick a republician president or demicrate president. Lastly. it is unfair to us. We have no power against the government, and our votes mean nothing to them.

The Electoral College can also lead to disasters! Riaets can flood the streets if they dont like the legislators choice, and that can lead to deaths. Secondly, shootings could start to occuring around the states, and can get out of hand. Inicent silvilians can get hurt for no reasons. Lastly, there can be financial crashes, and everyone around the states could go in dept.

to sum up my letter i think the Electorial College should be bannished for good. You have heard that it is a old process and can lead to falure, it is unfair to americans, and it can lead to disasters all around the country. Give the Americans what they want, freedom!",3,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Dear State Senator,

After much research, I have decided that the electoral college should not be kept. It is not completley fair, because the citizens think they're voting for their prefered candidate when really, they're voting for that candidate's electors. That means that if a candidate wins the votes of the citizens, he might not win the electoral college votes. This also means that he was not the president that the U.S. citizens wanted, but what the electoral voters wanted. In the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" they ask the question, ""Can voters sometimes controll whom their electors vote for?"" and they answer, ""Not always."" This proves that the electoral college is not fair. Also, the electoral college shouldn't be kept because some electors will, ""refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a vote for whomever they please,"" says ""The Indifensible Electoral College"".

""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" says ""The Indefensible Electoral College."" That is more than half of the United States population, therefore we should get rid of it. I believe that we should abolish it along with that 60 percent, thatway when voting, it will be much more fair. Also, it will make choosing the president of the U.S. up to the people.

Some may think that keeping the electoral college is good because, If there is a tie in the election, the electoral college can break it with their votes. Although this does help, it has only happened once, therefore proving to not be needed. Other reasons are because it gives certainty of an outcome, helps big states, and avoids run-off elections, but are also not that important.

In conclusion I, along with 60 percent of the U.S. populaton, believe that the electoral college should not be kept due to its unfairness.

"I am for the developement of driverless cars because they could create a lot of oppritunities for so many people. Special needs people who arent allowed to drive cars will now be able to because the car would drive itself. Blind people would not need to see. They would also not have to always be supervised or have to bring someone along with them when they go out. Many blind people are very independent and rather do things on their own so now they would be able to. Deaf people would not need to worry about being able to hear the ambulance or police when they are on their way to an emergency. They would also not need to worry about not being able to hear children playing around in the streets for saftey issues and the honking of other cars. That also goes for blind people. People of all ages would also be able to drive a car and not need to rely on someone else for support, even though there would still be an age limet for certain poeple to be able to drive the car but it would be much more safe.

In many countries they do not have the same laws as the United States so it would be way more simple for people that live in another country to come to america and drive a car. In Enland they drive on the other side of the road. If you grow up in a place with one set of rules and go to another place with a different set of rules it can become very complicated and confusing for that person. People who are afraid to drive or think they are not capible of doing it will also now be able to do it without and insicureities.

In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it says that google has has cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven mor ethan half a million miles without a crash. Some people get their drivers lisence and can't even drive properly. There are so many car crashes due to reckless drivers that could be reduce because of driverless cars. Drunk drivers will no longer a large part or car crashes. Familys would no longer have to worry about their loved ones getting home safe or being safe on the road. I know some people may make the arguement ''If they technology fails and someone is injued, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?'' and to that i would say thats why we need to keep on developing driverless cars becuase there will be trial and error but there always is for anything new that tries to be made. Cars today are not top quality safe so there is no reason to treat driverless cars anydifferent if a mistake is made. If someone is injured then the driver and and driverless car would be examined to determine the cause of injury. Therefore i am for the development of driverless cars because i think it would make the world a better place.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Dear State Senator,

I would like for you to change it to popular vote because ...

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president. If you lived in Texas for example and you wanted to vote for

John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 344 democratic electors pledged to

Kerry . On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place ? It depends on the state, sometimes state conventions, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control who their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes.

Also, the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.

Most worrying thing is that of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote of the president.

At the most basic level, the electoral college is just unfair to the voters. Because of the winner - take - all systemin each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.

Electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. Therefore, you should change it to popular vote, not electoral college.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,2
"It should be able to be used in the classroom because, people like themselves or the teacher should know how they are feeling today or want to know how they are feeling on certrain days, and what emotions they aren having.

It can help us learn more about emotions and how can we actually can tell how we are really feeling. I think we should also have them because it said in paragraph 6 ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and I think that will help us cause the teachers can then see we need help trying to understand or need to take breaks becuase we have became bored and or confuse. I also would love to use this to find out how my friends emotions are on a certain day because I wouldnt want to bother them if they are angry or sad. I would also use it for my teacher.

"Driverless cars are becoming a reality, rather than a dream. Google has been using them to create their 3-D maps around the globe, and now they are allowed in certain states of the U.S. Most have a very low collision rate, and could be handy in many situations. But even though they are an invention and are useful in some ways, there are too many legal things that could go wrong for them to be worthwhile. If a car crashes, is it the owner's fault or the car manufacturer? Will it make people rely even more on computers? Driverless cars, although a very useful invention for some purposes, will not catch on because of the legal issues that would follow, depenicey on computers that could fault to error, and the rewriting of driving laws and an education to even learn how to work with the autonomonus vehicle.

When you get into an accident with your car, usually it can fall under two catagories: your fault with driving, or the conditions of the outside and the built of the car. For a drastic example, if somebody was not paying attention to the road, rather a phone, and winds up headfirst into a tree, that does not require the car manufacturer to intervene because it was the driver's fault. Opposing, if there is a recall in the anti-lock break system and it causes a person to crash, that is more at fault with the car company, as their breaks were not up to standards and safety regulations. But with the idea of driverless cars becoming a reality, the line between the person and the manufacturer is blurred. If the car was driving itself and for some reason gets into an accident, is it the owner's fault, even if they couldn't control it? Or is the car manufacturer's fault, even if they had installed a sensor so that the person could take over? This arguement could lead to a lot of trials and conflicts over the legality of the car, and compared with other events happening, it would become more of a problem rather than a positive, causing legal battles and controversy over the car.

With the generation coming in of kids who have lived through the start of modern technology and social media, the baby-boomers and so on have a lot to say about the issue of modern technology. Many say it is a waste of time, and is teaching the new generations to be lazier, while it doesn't rather apply to social media and the interenet, as it has made a wonderful contribution to the global network, it can be argued that a driverless car while the driver sits and waits is rather lazy. But the bigger issue is the dependency on the computer; computers get hacked, glitchy, and tricky as it is, and it is rather unsettling to think the computer running your car, which holds your life, can screw up and change your life entirely. It is more settling if there were the mentioned lights and buzzers to let us know what is going on. ""GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger... Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays."" (7). Even though those forementioned signals are being in place, what if they are not working as well? Even though that might be a small chance of it happening, it is always a risk. To rely on a computer with your own life in the situation that you could use an actual car is quite unsettling, and even if it is safe at first, can always lead to accidents and glitches.

With the rise of the autonomous car, many precautions and risks are in place.

The chance of a legal battle with a car manufauctuer, and the idea of the computer glitching at the wheel are just two details about why the idea of an autonomous car would be more of a negative than a positive. The invention and ideas behind it are very well-supported and used well today, the reality is that it won't catch on to become mainstream. There are too many what-if's that if brought up, would make the general market iffy on letting go of the wheel.",4,3,2,2,1,1,2,3,2
"Dear,senator

I think you should vote on abolishing the Electoral College because it's obviously dumb.

First of all,they can be anybody which i believe is just wrongIt should be somebody who wants to be in it and works hard to do so.

Secondly,it makes zero sence what so ever that bigger states get more electoral votes because it's not fair to the other people in the state who want the other guy to win but that doesn't matter if it's the winner takes all syestem. Winner takes all system make no sence at all either. You shouldn't go by that if it's not what the people want. For example,in the year 2000 Gore won the popular vote or the vote the people wanted,and Bush lost. But since Bush won the electoral vote he became the president.

So what you are trying to say is that the peoples vote doesn't count when choosing the person that will help run this country? That is terrible! Instead of going by how big the state is and how many electoral votes they get it shiuld be the popular vote or the peoples vote!

"Limiting car usage would have many benefits for the environment.  Pollution in large cities would be reduced, greenhouse gas emissions would be lower, and noise pollution would be lower.  The simple act of of using alternative transportation would help the environment greatly.

Cities like Bejing, in China, are heavily polluted by emissions from motor vehicles.  This has negative effects on people's health and the environment.  Another point to be made is that if fewer people are driving cars then you won't have to see cars parked all over your city.  But this is America, not Europe; we like our cars here.  I couldn't stand not being able to drive my Ford Mustang GT whenever i feel like it. That is the problem, people will not want to give up driving their cars.

Most humans can already tell how our friends, family and other people are feeling just because we can look at them and tell how their feeling its as if we already knew hoow they felt just by the look on their face.

Everybody has an expression that shows how the feel each day a couple of genious's made an invention that changed the world it can tell you how a person is feeling in many different ways but they do it so everybody knows what they are feeling even though they might or might not know.

Everybody feels different emotions some might even be depressed because of maybe a loss of a family member or a best friend so might be angry because of many different things everybody have different emotions me i had depression for a long time and it took me a little bit to realize theres more to life than just sorrow or depression just move on and just try and find someone who makes me happy theres this girl that makes me happy we aren't dating but she gives me hope for the future as i said everybody is different.

"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" is a negative aspect to the future. It is a negative aspect because if Driverless cars are invented that can cause more accidents and more people will think that texting is okay

because these new cares are being invented and they will not have to be in charge of anything. The future with a transportation system would change the world into a worse place.

My position on driverless cars is that it will help some that can not drive good as others but the ones who will always count on their car now for anything will not know what to do if something were to happen suddenly. When this car alerts you on an accident ahead of you or getting through traffic the people will have no idea what to do because they will rely on this driverless car to get them through. ""Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch the drivers are remaining focused on the road."" What this quote is trying to illustrate is that the manufacturers would put cameras into the cars to test and see if the driver is still paying attention to the road even though it is a driverless car or if becasue it is a driverless car they will be distracted by something on there cellular device. Also, driverless cars is more dangerous than a person driving by itself because what if something where to happen to this car, or the system stopped working and the person that was not paying attention caused a huge accident. My position on driverless cars is that it still isn't driverless because you would still have to be alert to take over.

They need all of the support they can get in this fight for the world its there world there trying to fight and protect from getting kicked out of the system. They deserve a right to this and in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election if we didnt have the college. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii had voted the other way.

"My opinion on this whold driverless car deal is that it's not a terrible idea. I just don't see to much to offer besides a car that is just a waste of time on the road for everyone else. They have to test the car to be better and I understand that it's just that maybe we're not ready for cars like this so soon. As time goes on humans are more dependant on technology and we can't do that forever sometimes it's good for us to not rely on it so much. With cars we drive ourselves around and are alwayed focused on the road and what's around us at all times we become more alert in a way. Now with self driving cars we sort of loose that awareness of being alert all the time while on the road.

This idea is another great idea to keep the crash records down but it doesn't change the fact that humans almost everyday depend on everything to do something for us no matter how simple it is.

"Was the face created by aliens? According to the text, Mar Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1976, eighteen years after the viking mission ended. The Face is just a natural land form because NASA has not identified who could have done it,they only have images and the Face is in the ground whickh makes it a land form.

NASA does not see these faces all the time. Why is this ""landfrom"" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.

NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact. Maybe there are more underground built by aliens that you can not see.

This is a landform because NASA only has images. Images cn be deciving , I know from experience. This may look like a face, but is not. Sometimes things are not what they seem. In 2001 they had image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 metere per pixel in 1976.

The Face is in the ground. Being attched to the ground, not made by man is a land form. An alien is not a man even if the face is man created. It is simplily just a landform that looks like something that it is not. On Mars there are other land forms, but they just don't look like a face. The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This is not made made which makes it a lanform.

"Have you ever driven a car? If so, were you actually driving or was this car a driverless car? Many people are preferring to ride in driverless cars or semi driverless cars. Without your eyes on the road, how can driverless cars be safe? The Author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" gives examples of how driverless cars can result in being late, more expensive, and more acciddents.

In the story "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph three, states many companies that have started making these driverless cars. One being General Motors, whose idea was towards ""Smart Roads"". Having smart roads would be rediculous becuase of the expensises in using magnets and the special car sensor needed. If we had smart raods, and the road broke, what would we do? Basing all of our driving on a ""Smart Road"" would increase the risk of it breaking and everyone being late.

Okay, so smart raods are a terrible idea. What about smart cars? Google came out with a Toyota Prius. The prius uses postion-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a roatating senor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automatic radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor. Sounds cool right? There are a couple problems with all of this stuff on a car. The first problem being that if one thing broke it would be super expensive. the second problem being if one thing broke nobodywould be able to drive at all. The last problem with all of the gudgets on the car is having the extra weight on the car would make the gas milage go through the roof.

So, smart roads and smart cars are starting to sound like a bad idea. Still can not make up your mind? Take the human mind as a consideration. These smart cars would make humans lazy. If we had these driverless cars we would not pay any attention to whats going on on the road. In the story ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" paragraph eight reads "" some manufacturers hope to bring in-car entertainment. Think about what would happen if a car had a malfunction, would the other riders in the driverless cars be paying attention? Think about if a kid ran in the street after thier ball, would the car or the driver know? Finally, think about how much boring the world would be if you only rode in the car not drove it? Would you see the the beautiful blue sky or the amazing adventure of the forest? No, you wpould not. The little things are what make driving such a privledge not a right.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. As people, we should always look ahead at what is in front of us.

There are concerns about privacy to a computer tracking and watching you the moment you get on.

The technology would greatly impact teachers and students because now teachers now have a way to see how students are doing. Teachers could watch on their computers and when a icon comes up on a certain student that. They are showing signs of distress or confussion she or he could go over there and help them.

I personally believe that electing a President by popular vote  is a great way to elect the next president. The reason why I state this because ,when voting in an electoral college  the people are voting for a slate of electors instead of the President they want to be in office. But on the other hand,the popular vote declares the candidate that  recieved the most popular votes is the next president. We the peolpe want to vote for the next person to run our country , not a slate of electors.

Sometimes the election doesn't go as planned. Back in the election of 2000 Candidate Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush ,but Bush had more electoral votes and became President. I bet the people of America weren't to happy about that outcome , this was the first time this happened since 1888. Let's look at the election of 2012 , it states that our current President Barack Obama had ""recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney ."" It also states that residents of other regions that don't neccesary have electoral votes want a popular vote because "" residents of other regions are likely to feel disfranchised to feel that their votes dont't count that the new president will have no regard for their interest , that he really isn't their president .""

From African Americans fighting in the Civil War for the right to vote and women in the nineteenth-century also fighting for voting rights, Voting had always been a controversial topic. This privilege has changed many times in the beginning of the United States and since its birth, the primary way to vote for the president is the Electoral College. The Electoral college is a process of electors in it voting for the president. It is almost always an one-sided battle for whoever that agrees or disagrees with the Electoral Colloge. For someone that is usually neutral, i am in favor of keeping the Electoral College as the United States choose their president.

To begin with, even though the Electoral College is critisized of it not being democratic, it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed. The trust between the people and their electors is rarely betrayed, however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. The Electoral College will  almost always gurantee an outcome while if it was another way, more ties and balancing will happen. from the article itself, it stated ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""- Richard A. Posner. The Electoral College will always let the people's voices be heard even if it was in a indirect way.

Furthermore, The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No single region in the United States ave enough electoral votes for a president to get elected. Regional favorites, such as Romney in the south, will have plenty of problems if he is just a regional favorite instead of all over the country. This system will caused presidents to be more diversed in the country to be able to spread hierachical diffusion of the idea of geting themselves to be elected. From source number three, it also states that ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president.""- Richard A. Posner. The people will get to experience the president themselves instead of jst voting for the one they are biased upon.

Lastly, The Electoral College method of selecting the president avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. There is a pressure in which if no candidates win a majority of the vote,there will be a run-off election. that would greatly complicate the presidential election process by wasting more time and money. however, that process is reduced by the Electoral College method, which invariably produces a clear winner. The Electoral College System can also be argued against that it can turn off potential voters for a candidate who had no hope of carrying thier state. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, there will be less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""- Richard A. Posner is one of the quotes in source number three. But of course, no single vote can change the outcome of a presidential election since voters in presidential elections are mpstly people who want to express an opinion than thinking that a single vote will change a election.

In conclusion, our current way of the Electoral College system is the best way to vote for presidential elections. Even though people could argue that it is un-democratic, the way they elect the electors and having the president promote themselves in a certain way does make the system every one bit of it democratic. To remind you senator, the Electoral Collage system should stay because it still allows the peoples' voices to be heard and expessed, requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal, and it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast and also dissovles the problem of few potential voters not wanting to vote. That is why i truly believe that the Electoral Collage is here to stay.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,1
"The Facial Action Coding System would have value if used in a classroom. Not only would it benifit the teachers, but it would also benifit the students as well. The Facial Action Coding System in a classroom would have positive effects.

Applications of the FACS within a classroom are varied and vast. Just one use of FACS would be a survey. The student or teacher could be shown a video of controversial topics while the FACS would scan them. You would already know their thoughts about it without even asking them. If you wanted to perform a group survey, you could see the difference in their emotions when surrounded by friends and when not. And if the FACS wasn't fully tested, you could survey people and then compare the answers of the FACS and of the person. And even if none of the FACS surveys worked, there is still a chance that the survey subjects could learn more about human emotion. Even the world as a whole could gain from the FACS and learn more about human emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System could also be used on a much broader term. It could be used for online internet use as well. Virtual Reality could be integrated with FACS to create a more accurate representation of a person's face. Not only would that be amazing by itself, but it could also get humanity closer to full-body VR.

The FACS could help students and teachers realize their own emotions better about simple things like homework, or even eachother. A student could be playing an educational game to learn a new language. The student is trying his best, but the question is too hard for him. The camera would see this in his face, and change the difficulty of the question.

Although there are potential flaws with using the FACS technology, the positives completely outweigh the negatives. One potential flaw is that we could end up relying too much on the FACS tech and eventually won't be able to see human emotion by ourselves. This isn't a problem though. If we don't use the technology out of laziness, we will retain our social abilities, like empathy.

If we could have FACS technology integrated into classrooms, the positive possibilities that could open up would be so benificial for mankind, the internet, other students, parents, and even teachers.",3,4,2,3,3,3,2,3,3
"The 'Face' in Space

The Face is a bonafide example of a natural landform. However, some people say that it is an ancient artifact that proves that there is life on Mars. Scientists have said that the Face is just another buttle or Martian mesa, that the Face is just another natural landform and there isn't a face at all. It is just a common landform.

Even if the masses aren't satisfied, the Face will remain just a buttle or Martian mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia, the place where the Face was found. The Face only has shadows that make it appear like a face. Conspiracy theorists say that the Face might be evidence of ancient civilization on Mars, but defenders of NASA's budget beg to differ.

Truly, the face is just a natural landform.

As the text states ""There wasn't an alien monument after all.""The passage also reads that Malin sent a team to capture a more clear picture of the Face. Some said that there might have been hidden alien markings, and they were proven wrong. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to get a clear picture of the Face. As it turns out, there really wasn't a alien monument after all.

In the beginning, there was no face to begin with. The Face only had unusual shadows that made it look like a face. NASA unveiled the image for everyone to see and here in the passage it reads ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" This shows that there wasn't a face, just an illusion.

There is the arguement that the Face is evidence of an ancient civilization. At the time the picture of the Face was taken, it was winter. Perhaps the alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze. Mission controllers even looked again. On a cloudless, summer day, the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take the another picture, in hope there was something that they didn't see. Even so, the scientists were proven right again. The Face was really a mesa, a landform common in Cydonia.

In conclusion, the Face turned out to be a common landform. Just another buttle, another landform, another rock formation, not really a face at all. There is no evidence that there was even a civilization and there wasn't even evidence that there was life to begin with! Again, there could have been alien markings that were covered by the haze, and there could have been life on Mars. Let us face the facts though; in this reality; there isn't a face on Mars, there isn't a civilization on Mars and it is just another landform.",3,3,3,2,1,2,1,2,2
"Well certenly we all have different facial expressions. But have you ever looked at somone and they look like they are made but they really are not? Well I feel that we shlould not use tecnology to view somone's feelings. A lot of differnt things can be misunderstood just with one little mistake. I will be telling you some reasons.

Tecnolgy does not alwys read ot tell the truth. It will be hard to tell if someone is really mad or has some feelings indide themselves if using tecnolgy. Mayeb the person can be happy and excited from the inside but from they outside they show a differnt facial expression. I feel that tecnology will just mess evrything up. We need to keep it all natural and they was it is now.

If somoene is das you can see it nut you don't know how they feel inside. You can probobbly draw a picture of them or soemthing instead of using tecnology. Also any type of facial expression sould be valuable in the classroom. You can't really judge a book by it cover. So really there is no need of using tecnology to see somones looks or to make them that way. Everyone has differnt reactions to differnt things.

So I think that tecnology shpuld not be usted to identify somone or to give them a value. They are how they are and that is how it is. In a classroom ther can also be differnt values and differnt emoltional expressions. Someone might feel down but we don't know that until they talk to us or let us help them. So no tecnoligy shpuld not be allowed to try and guess someone's value or feelings.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article focused on the topic of studying Venus and what diffculties can happen, but also the benefits and knowledge gained.

The author describes how exploring Venus can be dangerous but can also help the Earth's population.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well with evidence.

The author supports the main idea well with evidence and details included in the article.

At first, the author shows some of the dangers involved in exploring Venus, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3).

This fact gives an example of a bad situation that people might go through if they explore Venus.

The author uses this fact to remain unbiased and show both sides of the argument.

Later in the article, the author says, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (5).

This statement describes a solution to humans not being able to survive Venus's conditions.

Exploring Venus is so important that scientests thought of ways to complete that mission safely.

Lastly, the author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth... Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4).

This realization illustrates how beneficial traveling to Venus is because it could be a planet that humans could use for habitation.

Exploring Venus is necessary because the human population might need to use the planet in the future.

It is always good to have a backup plan if something on Earth goes horribly wrong.

Overall, facts listed in the text support the author's main idea and purpose.

The main idea, that Venus is worthy to pursuit even with its dangerous elements, is supported and shown well by the author.

The author does this by including facts and statements that keep the article unbiased and describe the incredible benefits of exploring Venus.

The main point comes across well because it opens the readers' mind to the possibility of venturing to Venus and what it could do for our planet.",2,3,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"Facial Acting Coding System

In the article ""Making Mona LIsa Smile"" Nick D'Alto talls about a new technology named ""Facial Acting Coding System"", this type of new technology will identify your students emotions it will tell you if your studetns are happy, sad, angry or in fear. Teachers should be aware if students are understanding our class, if they are enjoying it and most important we shoould know if students are having raugh times in school or out of school.

In all schools there is studetns who half the time do not understand a lesson given by a teacher or electronic, students are embearrased to raise there hand and ask for help, students will rather miss the whole lesson and not understand than raise there hand and ask for the help they need. If we have the new ""Facial Action Coding System"" this would help studetns by grades, they would understand the subject and will be able to do their homework, test and quizzes with out a problem. so that means better grades.

Studenys will get bored during a class, when they get bored they will most likely not pay attention and wont do anything. If this technology were to be in classrooms this will help the teachers know when they are not focusing no moe, this would help teachers be better during a lesson. This will benefit the studetns from not paying attention.

Many teachers do not know there studetns. They do not know when students are going through something, if you look onlined the suicide percent is high because of bullying, bullying happens in every school. This technology will stop familys from loosing there kids to suicide. Teachers would be aware of studetns emotions and will get to know thre studetns more.

In conclusion this new technology will help all schools, teachers and stusdetns.",3,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0
"They say Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Its a crucial consideration given the long time frames of spave travel. The value of returnung to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

I think if we can study Venus up close we'll get a better understanding of the planet, like what materials it has and how the weather conditions are. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground.

To meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",0,2,2,3,1,3,3,3,2
"Reading this article on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" there would have to be an agreement on technology to read the emotional expressions of students. Well technology to begin with now adays is so advanced almost anything is possible. The reasoning behind how computers can read peoples emotions is proven by The Facial Action Coding System.

The sensors in a computer can decode how you are feeling just by the movement in a persons face called the ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, has already classified the six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is based off the movement of our facial muscles. There are different muscles in your face that help our cheeks, eyes, mouth and forehead to move different ways when we make different facial expressions. When we are angry, we squint our forehead together and our mouth tightens. When we are happy, the eyes squint and rise, along with our cheeks and mouth. it opens wide and the corners of our mouth also rise. along with our other emotions, FACS detects the movement of these muscles and determines whether we are happy or just faking it. Even by the slightest different movement, when a smile is on your face but isnt't real. Everyday, its seen on someones face normally their true emotion. If a person is smiling but not a big, and you are surrounded by this person, you may be able to tell if it's real or not. FACS proved that it van detect emotion through videos, images, or even in a mona lisa painting.

Yes, I agree with the article that was written becuase not only from the evidence that was supported in the article, everyone has put on a face that wasn't real and had been called out on it. Even the expressions a person makes are instinctual. When you get angry, sad, or happy, you make a face unintentionally before you even think about it. A person doesn't put on a front when they stub there toe. That persons face will cringe and they may cry or scream. FACS is accurate and even without it, it's sort of a given how someone is feeling by their facial expressions.",1,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The solar system has always been a mistory to many people. The unknown can be kind of scary for someone unfamiliar with space. But that is not the case now, scientists have been questioning the planet venus our neighbor in space. Trying to figure out the insides of this planet has proven to be quite difficult.

Always seeking to know as much as we can, humans have proven that statement many time. This discovery might just up at the top with some of the best things ever found. Venus a inhospitable planet, making scientists question it. A atmosphere almost made of %100 percent carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds. The planets surface averaging around 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than earths. These conditions are said to be able to crush submarines and liquefy many types of metals. You think this would stop scientists from trying to exsplor this planet, wrong.

They believe that Venus once was like earth. Covered in oceans and supported various life forms. With many failed attempts scientists believe that they will be able to get a unmanned spacecraft down to the surface before it is destroyed by the conditions of the planet. With light not being able to break throught the atmosphere there is no way to take pictures of videos, making it even harder to see. NASA has an idea that instead of going to the surface of the planet they float above it. With a 30 mile long blimp that is maned and would safely sit above the planet and be able to study parts of the planet. ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans"". Still not being able to get samples for planet they have managed to think of something that might be able to survive the conditions of the planet for 3 weeks. Made of silicon carbide, these electronics have been tested in a chamber simulating venus ""chaos"".

Another project they have been working on is an old World War II device, a mechanical computer. Using only gears and levers and do not require eletronics, ""these have been made to be ""more resistant to pressure, hear, and other forces"".

Scientists believe that this planet has value, mostly human curiosity. This planet has been thought to inhabit life long age and have oceans covering the surface. While the risk might be high, what we might find on this planet might be life changing for the human race.",2,2,3,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Dear State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. It is very rare that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.

The U.S Chamber of Commerce and some others agreed to abolishing the electoral college. Because of the quirks of the electoral college, won the popular vote but the electoral college still has its defenders. The electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. Although the electoral vote may be unfair to voters it gives the president a better chance of winning the election. There is a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral Colege vote but not likely for the popular vote. For this is because the winning candidates share of the Electoral vote exceeds it's share of the popular vote. For exemple, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in the 2012's election.

The Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. If you are a regional favorite, as Romney was in the South, there is no need to campaign big in those states becuase no region has enough electoral votes to elect president. Therefore, Romney gains no electoral votes by increasing his popularity in states he knows he will win. It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state but, have a less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a polital preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election.",0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The "" Driverless Cars Are Coming"" article talks about changing cars into smart computer cars. I am against this design because if the car malfuctions in the middle of the road or highway there could be many people hurt. Not only does Sergey Brin need to think about others he also needs to think about if he would

use the car or not.

Awhile, ago other engineers were talking about making smart roads but that cost to much so what is the difference between the roads and cars. Making smarter cars could also cost more or about the same amount as smarter roads.

Dr. Werner Huber explained in the passage that, ""Such displays can be turned off instanly when the driver needs to take over."" This doesn't stop drivers from texting and driving becasue the drivers know that the car has took over so they don't have to pay attention to the rode. It would be better if the driver would have all of the authority instead of the car. It would be better for the smart car to come in when the driver is in danger and help to prevent any accidents from happening. For the states that doesn't allow this experiment would be much safer because they don't have to worry about any probelms going wrong with the experiment.

The driving laws focus on keeping the driver, passengers, and pedestrains safe. So instead of working on how the make the cars smarter the law cares more about the peoples safety. If any driver is injured during this experiment then, the person who would be hed responsible would be the manufacturer.",2,3,2,1,0,0,1,1,0

If this technology can tell emotions just by printing a 3-D picture of someone then this technology can help a lot of people like councelors. Councelors can use this to know exactly how there patient feels exactly at that moment. This technology could help Therapist help kids, teens and also adults from suicide, or keep people from hurting them selves. This can help people and people can actually use this technology to prevent many things. Teachers that use this can know if a student is struggling and needs more help than what they are asking. Nintey percent of kids around the world do ask question but dont ask enough of them and they dont ask the full question because they think they might look stupid for aslking a question. In the world everyone has there own opinion but this technology can really be used for something good.

"Dear State Senator,

I, PROPER_NAME, think that we should not abolish the electoral college! The Electoral College has been used for many years and not been a problem til now. In my opinion, people are just getting upset because the nominees they voted for didn't get elected.

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachroninsm, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner"". (paragraph 15 in source 3) It's the electors who elect the president, not the people. When we vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. Some people don't know that. Though each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is rarely betrayed. It is possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has rarely happened.

The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president anyways. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, to really listen to the competing candidates, knowing that they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average, (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidate, and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

In conclusion, many people are unaware of the election rules. They don't know what they are talking about when it comes to political stuff. Therefore, you should not listen and keep the electoral college!

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME",1,4,1,2,1,2,2,1,2
"The Electoral College is a great way to elect a upcoming President. The Electoral College was created by our founding fathers. The Electoral College has 538 electors.

First, The Electoral College is the best way to elect your President. There are some drawbacks like it is outdated and irrational, but it has been working in the country since the founding farthers. The reason why we should not abolish The Electoral College is that every state counts as a vote. One example is that Florida has 29 electoral votes, but big states with less people has a lowerer electoral vote.

Second, ""The Electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast"" said In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president. Another reason why we should keeep the Electoral College is that it doees the vote cast on how many people are in the state not how big the state is.

"Reducing the usage of cars in today's world could be extremely beneficial. Sure, it is also a hastle having to re-route your commute and also making the time to get there, but the myriad advantages to the reduction of car usage is astonishing. Reducing our usage of cars will reduce the smog in cities, such as Los Angeles, Beijing, and Paris, reduce the stress of many drivers, and also save people money. Now who doesn't love money?

Smog/pollution is growing daily in dense, polluted areas. Looking outside of LA, you can see the dirty, polluted air surrounding the city, as well as the toxic blanket the covers Beijing. One of the main sources contributing to this is cars. Greenhouse gases are emitted from tailpipes and go straight into the atmosphere. In Europe, exhaust makes up fifteen percent of greenhouse gas emission, and accounts for fifty percent in the United States, FIFTY PERCENT. That's half of the pollution in our country, and an easy solution is to limit car usage. If your car usage is not limitable, perhaps switching to a hybrid car such as a Toyota Prius will make you feel good about contributing to the cause. Some areas, like Bogota, Colombia, participate in a Car-free Day. This day is widely celebrated in the area and is infectiously spreading to nearby areas and potentially the world soon enough. This day allows for smog reduction. Cities such as Paris, however, have to ban car usage sometimes because their smog is so bad. During this ban, hybrid cars and carpooling is allowed. This shows the extreme measures necessary to reduce the smog in populated areas.

As most people know, driving is stressful and is perhaps a top contributer of stress in America. In populated areas, rush-hour traffic is annoying and causes many people to change their schedules. When driving during rush-hour, you are in constant fear of potentially being cut-off and your risk of being in an accident heightens dramtically. With that being said, what if I told you there was a way to completely cut out this fear? Communities such as Vauban, Germany are helping alleviate stress by making car-free communities. Within these communities, cars are allowed to be owned, but you must park it in a parking garage at the end of the community and also buy a spot... for $40,000. Cars are used rarely, as restaurants, shops, and others are within walking distance of these communities. Cars are only used for long-distance travel and are permitted on highways and on the outer edges of the area. The stress is alleviated because you can walk outside, grab your mail, and listen to the birds if want, all without the worry of cars. You don't need to constant check your rear-view mirrors if you're walking to your favorite restaurant. With the introduction of smartphones and the constantly growing usage rate of the internet, people don't need cars to communicate anymore. They can simply go on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. to communicate.

Finally, the reduction of car usage allows for people to save money, and a significant amount too. If you live in a neighborhood such as Vauban, there may be no need for a car at all. In today's world, a good car costs somewhere are 30-40 thousand dollars. Imagine what you could do with that much money. You could get a nice house, or travel to your favorite destination, or anything really. You could send your kid to a nice college! And the drawbacks are small, because everything is within a twenty minute walk. That sounds pretty nice to me.",4,4,3,3,2,3,3,3,3

Hopefully these senators come to realize that it is a fair oppurtunity if citizens also have a say when the desicions are being made. For the good of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America would be an amazing change.

To commence with, citizens don't have a say in whose their leader. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" No where in the process of deciding which president should be chosen , does a citizen have a say in who they want. These are citizens who work and give tax money to the state and help the important people like the senators, presidents , vice president etc., they deserve respect and have a chance to be a part of a popular vote for the president of the united states of America. Although having popular vote can still fail to satysify some masses of people , it is a way where everyone could be involved in fair desicions. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" The man said it himself. Bradford Plumer is against having the Electoral system. Hopefully one day state senators of the U.S. and the District of Colombia doesn't fail to realize that their system of voting for the president and vice president are unfair to the Citizens of their country. Changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America instead of the electoral college because citizens aren't having a say in any important decisions.

Furthermore, desicions may fall into the wrong hands. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.)"" The election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster. What if the house of representatives only has one political party? then does the president who is in that political party always win? There are so many reasons why citizens should have a chance to have vote by direct popular votes, that way descions wont fall into the wrong hands.

In conclusion, the state senates should consider making a new sysytem of voting;changing to election by popular votes.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Are driverless cars safe? Cars have been around for many decades and more to come. Cars are used in peoples everyday life. Cars are developing in many ways. I think driverless cars are not developed because; it's not completely driverless,It's challenging, and the car isn't advance.

Frist, driverless cars are not completely driverless. In the text it says,''this means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.'' If the car isn't completely driverless there is no point on getting a car like this. This car can only handle driving functions up to 25mph. This mean the driver needs to keep hold of the wheels.

Secondly, the driverless car is challenging. It means it's hard to drive. Driverless cars are dangerous. It's not even driverless completely. This type of technology is sometime too advance for people. In the text it says, ''drivers have to steer,accelerate, and brake themselves.'' The driver is doing all the work.

Lastly, the driverless car isn't that advanced. In the text it say,''none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' This car tells you bthe simplest thing. In the text it says,'' it notify the driver when there's a work zone and accident.'' This car isn't really that helpful.

The driverless car isn't developed. You still should have a hand of the wheel. This is not yet completely driverless. This car tells you the simplest thing and not advanced. Why would anyone want a car that just tells you the simplest things that you can tell form just looking up at the road.",1,3,2,2,0,1,0,0,1
"The Face on Mars is not a legitimate face or a creation of aliens. Conspiracy theorists seem to think it really is. The landform is comparable to the multitude or butte or mesa landforms found here on Earth. The picture taken in 2001 has three times the pixels sizes compared to the pixels in '76, also if this Martian landform was indeed crafted by aliens it would benefit NASA a lot.

The Face on Mars can be compared to the lot of landforms in the Western America. One scientists, Garvin, recalled ""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho."" This can also be a reminder of other landforms, such as the Appilachian Mountain or Old Faithful- the water geyser at Yosemite National Park. In Cydonia, there are also quite a few odd landforms. The Face is just another one of the many unexplainable formations on Mars.

The day the picture of the Face was taken, the people in the spacecraft had to go through many misty clouds. That day was a cloudy day on Mars. The picture taken had three times the pixels than the picture taken in April of 1998.The picture was clearer and one could see that the shadows that creates the parts

of the face are just only shadows. The only unusual thing about it was that it looked ""like an Egyptian Pharoh.""

The main reason conspiracy theorists would believe the Face in an alien craft is because it is an unusual landform. NASA scientists wanted more attention toward Mars and they wish there really was an Ancient Martian colony. It would benefit NASA and its funding.

One now can come to the conclusion that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. The Martian landform is quite similar to the ones found in western America. The original picture taken in '76 had less pixels making the picture appear odd, and if this was a formation created by aliens, NASA would use it as a benefit.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Can't fake out your teacher of a lesson anymore. This new technology called ""Facial Action Coding System"" can read your emotions through muscles in your face. This technology can enchance lessons being taught to students, and also help tell if a student is struggling with emotional issues. This technology can modify lessons for each individual student and could possibly help the teen rates of depression or other mental disorders.

This tech could be put in classrooms and read every students face while the teacher presents the lesson. As Dr. Huang states in the article ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Facial muscles will move in the different patterns depending on how that person is feeling. This could give the teacher signals that he or she needs to change it up and get the class's attention back. Additionally this could also alert the teacher that a student is struggling.

If a student is struggling with depression or anxiety, which are some of the leading issues with teenagers in present day, the computer system could detect it and put someone's attention to it. The human eye can only tell so much from looking at someone facial expression. As the article informs ""... we humans can perfrom the same impressive ""calculation"" every day.... Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" We can only perferm so much, but FACS uses video imagey to track facial motions. Each emotional uses different muscle combinations to express themselves. Although this technology is a great step, how much does this require to become practical?

This tech could cost school systems thousands of dollars and doesn't make up for when the student is at home. The article makes a remark about this topic by saying ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" If it can not decode that then how will it decode a human's face. The human face is much more complex than a painting. This shows that the technology has great potential, but still requires some improvements.

FACS can assist teachers in lessons and help call out students in need. It isn't perfect though and requires more steps to become easy to access, but it has major potential to benefit our lively-hoods in the future. You better start practcing your fake smile or get ready to learn more easily, because FACS will be in use soon.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Dear Senator,

I text you because I want changement for now I don't want to keep the Electoral College I want to have Election by popular vote for the next president.

Because if you have a vote who comptabled to more vote than another vote of citizens it's not fair...

If you give one vote for one citizens and one vote for all people who leave in United States that's more fairy for the candidat for the Presidential Electoral and for the citizens,

I think it's as better idea because the election are more fairy and the president can look how many people vote for him after, why a citizens cannot have plus votes than a Electoral College why?

If you give more votes to a citizen  I think you can have a problem because if one citizen have three or four votes there are so much votes and if all the Electoral College votes for the same candidat. He has got more chances be elected maybe.

It's my personal oppinion because I really want to help my country because of him I tell you now he's gave me a work, my family all my life if the United States are never here I'm not here to because It's my land...

If you can do something to changesd this or do a representatif election to vote this that's will very nice for the citizens and the United States.

Thank you so much for all you did a good job.",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now a days you see everyone with cars driving to places instead of walking. There are some small towns that cars are not needed because everything is so close but other cities everyone has to drive because everything is very distant from one another. Cars are needed on a daily basis to get to school, or to get to their job but walking or even biking would be a great idea because you would not be poluting the environment there would be less traffic jams and it would reduce the greenhouse gas. Limiting car usage would be a great idea and it would make peoples life a lot better and healthier because instead of driving they would walk to take a bike.

Polution is a big problem especially in big cities because everyone is driving and the smoke the cars leave makes our environment gross. Polution is not only because of the smoke the cars produce, it can also be when someone throws plastic into the oceans and poluting the waters or having trash in parks without recycling. I think we should re-enforce the recycling systems because many people dont know the benefits to that and how better our community and even world could be. When your are driving a car and especially in big cities like New York you need a car everywhere or just take the taxi. But just taking the taxi it wont reduce the probablity of polluting the air, it will still have the same effect as if you were driving your own car. If people would just walk or bike to their job or to their school poluting the air would not be a problem just like stated in source 2. In source 2 it talks about how in Paris they would fine the people up to 31 dollars.

There would also be less traffic jams due to the limiting of car usage just like stated in Source 3. In source 3 it talks about how in Bogota, Colombia there is a program that the colombians would ride their bike skate or take the bus and there would be less traffic jams. That is a very good idea because no one likes to be stuck in traffic especially if your in a hurry to get to work or even school. Traffic jams occur because of so many cars on the road. There is a thing called Rush hour and that is when everyone is leaving their work or school and they are going home and that is when everyone is on the road and thats when their is the most traffic. But it would be much easier if you would just bike or walk or take a bus and tried to avoid all of those traffic jams. The program that Bogota, Colombia has created is something that should be done nationwide because it would help so many other countries. Thanks to that programm people would go to the park and do sports and take walks.

Source A talks about the Greenhouse gas and how in Vauban,Germany soccer moms gave up their cars and how the streets were "" Car Free"". That led to having 70 percent of the families in Vauban to not having  cars and 57 percent of the people that moved to Vauban to sell their cars. According to this source a person said they are much happier not owning or having a car because when Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother had a car she said she was more tense. Apperently this movement was called "" Smart Planning"".

Limiting car usage would be a great benefit to people and a great idea to improve Earth. Pollution like mentioned before is one of the biggest problems we have and in big cities is an evern bigger problem. Traffic jams is something that will be hard to stop because everyone is using cars and will continue to use cars because it seems like thats the fastest way to get to your location but thats not accurate because if people think that way then thats the cause of traffic jams and thats the cause of the Rush hour. The movement in Vauban, Germany is something that people should do. Im not saying sell your car but to reduce the car usage is something that would be very helpful not only to you, but for the environment.",3,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever wondered how students may learn better. Well what if I told you it is Facial Action Coding System? Does'nt it sound complex and difficult? This technology is able to read human facial expressions and determain if a person is mad sad angry or happy. This type of technology would be so benificial in student school life and this is how.

What if your son or daughter is having trouble in school because the words that are on a passage that is being read on the computer is to complex for them. Would'nt you want the teaacher to give them a simplified edition of the passage. If FACS was used on this computer the program could sense that the student is confused and it will automaticly switch it to a simple edition.

Bullying is becoming a big problem in the world at schools. What if a student is being bullied and they do not want to show there emotions. This technology could find out there true emotions in a attempt to help the student overcome their problem.

What if a student stole something of another kid and you want to find out if he really did it then you can use this program to figure out by the students facial expressions. This could make it so much easier to solve issues in the day to day world to solve crimes in school or conflicts.

These are all great resons on why the FACS program should be used in schools. This would be very benificial for students, teachers, and even the parents of the student.",2,2,2,3,0,0,1,1,1
"What is the Face

What made the face? Was it aliens or just a coqencedince? People have been asking this same question ever sence 1976. Well, in my opinion i think that it is just a big coquencedence. The photo has been inhaced so much that you can tell in just a mountain or rock but defently not a symble of alian life.

The face of mars is defentilly just a rock formation in 1976 when the rock formation was found they thought it was a coquencidence and they were right. In 1998 they took another photo of the ""Face of Mars"" they had a beter camera with more pixels in it. This photo still does look like a face but you can also kinda see it starting took look like a mountain. Then the last photo that was taken of the ""Face of Mars"" was in 2001 and you can obviosly see that the so called face is just rock formation. The authore put this quote of someone from nasasay this As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". As you can see the even people at nasa dont even belive that it could be a monument of anything. The aouther of this passage also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."". Again as you can see the so called face is just coquencedence.

Some people still belive that this rock formation is a symbol of alian life. There main aurgument is that ""NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."", and all i have to say about that is if there was life on mars nasa would be the first one to say somthing they dont relize that NASA would make so much money off of it.

The most recent photo of the Face has shown that if it was civilized we would see it. As you can see that the ""The Face of Mars"" is just a rock formation. People think that its a big conspiristy theroy, but it isnt its just a big coquencedence. If there is Alians out there and some way its a symbol I just hope next time they make it a little more clear.",2,3,3,2,0,0,1,1,0
"From the early 2000's to the present day, the number of people who own cars throughout Europe and the United States has gone down. Although personal motorized vehicles can be convenient to own and use, there are many advantages to not owning a car, such as a decrease in air pollution, experiencing other sources of transportation, and an overall cultural shift.

Air pollution is a big issue all around the world. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and fifty percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in some highly populated areas in the United States. Cities such as Paris have banned cars for a few days in order to reduce the greenhouse gases emitted into their atmosphere. Congestion of environmentally damaging gases went down by sixty percent in Paris after their cleanse, where as before the cleanse, they were suffering through five straight days of heavy smog. Cars are the second most source for carbon emission in the United States. Lower amounts of cars owned results in less pollution in the air, which creates an all around better environment, a huge advantage.

Without personal cars, people resort to using other new and exciting forms of transportation such as biking, walking, hiking, or using buses, taxis, or the transit. In Vauban, Germany, the residents live a new lifestyle without personal cars. The community is small, and there are just a few streets that are easily accessible. The residents in the community experience a life that is close to the people around them. In Bogota, Columbia, once a year they have a car-free day, where the population must find other ways to get around instead of their personal vehicles. The car-free day is very popular, and as a result, has allowed the city to invest in one hundred and eighteen miles of new bike paths and sidewalks, new parks, and new sports centers. In the United States, some people decide to just set up their life around their home. Everything they have to get to is within walking distance of their home. The number of miles driven peaked in 2005, and then declined hevily afterward. In New York, the bike sharing program and the car pooling programs have allowed for less personal car use. Driving by teenagers all throughout the United States has decreased by twenty-three percent between 2001 and 2009.

The decrease in personal vehicle use is leading to a revolutionary cultural change that is crossing borders and making it's way around the world. Since World War II, the development of the world has revolved around the car, but that will soon change. From Vauban, Germany, where there is no car use at all, to the United States, where in 2013, the number of miles driven per person was equal to that of 1995, this cultural change is making it's way into each home. Some explanations for this change are the internet and city centers. The internet allows people to feel connected to family and friends without having to drive to see them. City centers have made the suburbs less populated, which results in less driving back and forth. Some possible results from a cultural shift away from the use of personal cars are less dependence on the car industry, and overall smaller, closer, and more community-driven cities based around transportation such as biking and walking. In the long run, this cultural shift would be an advantage to the world.

In Europe and the United States, many people have already made the shift away from personal car usage. People of the world can partake in a cultural change of less car usage, experiencing different forms of transportation, and all the while positively affecting their environment.",3,4,3,4,3,3,3,3,4

"In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Many people are still convinced that this is an extra teresrial creation and thet Ancient Eqypt had truely been crated by these creatures considering the fact that this face looks like and ancient pharoa from around those exact times.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Understanding the exact emotion of a human being is a giant leap for the science community, and I say that we should use this technology in classrooms. The relationship between students and teachers is strong, but how does a teacher know that a student is paying attention or just lying to try and end the discussion sooner? Student faces are hard to understand by just simply looking at them, some could look bored but are actually paying attention or the opposite could be happening. Using such technology could improve the understanding of student reactions, such as helping the teacher know when to modify the lesson for the student to better understand, and it could even improve the learning of future doctors and surgeons taking medical classes.

Lessons in certain classes can be very difficult for every student to understand. Some are fast learners and catch on before others, others might need the lesson to slow down just to get a grasp on what is really being taught. Using the Facial Action Coding System could really improve the understanding in teachers of who really gets the lesson and can continue and who doesn't understand and just really needs more help. As mentioned in paragraph 6 by Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Schools around the world are using technology more and more every day, so installing such a system to help understand confusion and boredom could be very useful for schools everywhere.

Doctors and surgeons need to know as much as they can gather from the human body, in which they learn all they know in classrooms. Having this system in classrooms could inprove the future of the medical field, starting by understanding which muscles control a body part and how the body reacts. Students taking these classes can use the program to learn how the face modifies itself to show emotions, from joy to sadness. As mentioned in paragraph 5, even artists such as da Vinci used anatomy to create art by studying how the face moves and shows emotion. Using this program can help doctors expan their knowledge of human anatomy rise to the next level.

Everyday, people use their emotions to express how they feel,and using that in the classroom can really improve relationships between the peers. Explained in paragraph 5 once again, humans use calculations to figure out how a friend is feeling, but we can't tell the exact muscle causing that emotion. Using such a system can improve relationships between friends and help people have a better understanding of how a person really feels.

Human emotions are difficult to understand all over the globe, but using this program in simple places such as the classroom can improve the atmosphere and make learning topics a breeze. Teachers could better understand how a student is reacting to a lesson and modify their teaching methods so everyone can understand. Students trying to get a medical degree can use the program to understand which muscles are used without having to disect a person or take years to learn something that can be found out in mere minutes. Understanding others can improve the world of emotions, even if it just starts in a classroom.",4,4,3,3,2,3,3,3,3
"The use of this technology is not valuable for a studdent in a class because some emotions are to be kept because with this technology students emotions will be out there for people to wonder what is happening with the child.Well how about the child do not want other people to know what is happening in his or her life or with his or her emotions.In the artical it states that the computer could recognize when the student is beccoming confused or bored, My question is how will the teacher know when she is teaching the children, and how will she know that one of her students is confused, it also stated that it could modify the lesson like a human instructor and that would be taking jobs from teachers . One of my questions is that if the computer knows what you are feeling and if it says that you are bored and the computer will modify to like a human instructor will it spice things up and make lessons funner and interesting so kids won't get bored?Im againt using this technology for it to read the students emotions because some emotions are to be kept and it is creepy for a computer to be reading your emotions that maybe you didn't know you were feeling.",1,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In 1976, a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars. The Viking 1 was taking pictures of possible landings for Viking 2, but instead it spotted a shadowy human face. Many people belived that it was the Face of an alien artifact while scientists say that it's a landform on Mars. I believe that the Face is a natural landform not a alien artifact.

To begin with, when Viking 1 first took those pictures they were shodowy and quite blurry too. I first thought that it was the Face of a alien artifact, but I then

realized that it was not. It was just another Martian mesa that has unusual shadows around it. It's

a huge rock that resembles to a human head. Of course it's formed by shadows, but the shadows give a illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to snap more pictures. Michael Malin snapped pictures that were 10 times sharper than the original. This time the pictures was less shadowy. The picture was realeased into a website

and it was just a natural landform not a alien monument. In the picture that was taken in 1998 has a better quality, but people belived that it was a cloudy time of that year on the Red planet.

Soon pictures were taken again in 2001. This time the images were new

high-resolution and 3D altimetry which were from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft. The picutres reveals thats it is actaully a mesa! You may argue with me but the picture is a digital image which is 3 times bigger than the pixels size. For example, if there was a small shack on the ground you could see what they were.

Many people had hoped that the original pciture was the Face of an alien artifact, but when NASA said that it was not people argued back with them. NASA tooks pictures of it in 1998 to make people belive that it was just a mesa, but people still didnt belive. So in 2001, NASA took another picture which was digital image and it proved that the image of the Face was just a mesa.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"I think The Facial Action Coding System should be put into classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System is a system that enables computers to identify human emotions. This a real system that actually works it scans your face to see what emotions you have.

In order for this to work the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. I think the use of this in a classroom is going to workout great for the students and the teachers. If you have the Face Action Coding System in the classroom the teachers can scan the faces of there students will the teacher is teaching them a lesson. After it scans the faces of the students the teacher can then see if the students are enjoying the lesson or if they aren't enjoying. This could change the way teachers teach kids by doing stuff creative different days so the kids will enjoy what they are being taught. Instead of being upset about what they are learning.

This is also a good idea for teacher as well to see if there students are having a hard time or if they are upset about something. Some kids don't like to talk about what they are upset about unless someone ask them first. The face scaning decive will be a helpful thing to put in a classroom. plsu while your face is geting scanned you have to make a happy face therefore the experiment will make you slightly happy. I think they should start putting these in the classrooms now.

Having these in the class will make kids want to learn and the teachers will be able teach the kids because the kids will be focused. It will be a great thing to have in a school it's always good to see the emotions of the kids in the classroom. Even for the teachers if the teacher is uspet the students can see his emotions with the face scanner. All in all i think they should start putting them in classrooms. I am for the use of this technology as me being a student i think something like this would be a cool thing to have in my school.",2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,1
"In my own opinion I think that it is a bad idea to explore the habitat and enviroment of venus because the conditions just seem to unbareable but the author do make some good points on why we should explore it a little more. One reason the author wants to pursuit exploring venus is becasue it's the second planet from the sun and really close to earth its often referred to as Earth ""twin"". Long ago like hundreds or even millions of years ago venus have beeen the most earth like planet in our solar system. Venus have many and multiple things that are similar to earth for instance venus have rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters. I think the author have a good reason to keep studying venus it is earth like with all the similar features besided from the high carbon dioxide and extreme storms and weather temperatures.

Humans have sent numerouse spacecraft to land on venus but none have survived for more than a few hours. Every since then not a single spacecraft have touched down on venus since more than three decades. Venus have a thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Venus temperatures is really extreme the temperature average eight hundred degrees on a regular. The pressure and atmosphere is ninety times greater then earth's atmosphere.

Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closest to the sun. This reason being is because of the weather conditions venus have erupting like valcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes that hits the surface. These conditions are far extreme then anything on earth. The conditions on venus could crush a submarine accustomed for diving to the deepest parts of our ocean. But still NASA is trying to figure out a way to send scientist to venus so they can study the palnet more.

Scientist say that venus could have been covered in with largely oceans and had life forms on its planet similar to earth. they say this because venus still have some features that are analogous to thoes on earth. They say that sometimes venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Scientist is making a blimp like craft so that can float thirty miles above venus to study it better. Scientist wants to find out how much venus is like earth and trying to see if it csn somehow be habital in them extreme conditions.

But why drive a car and sit there for up to thirty minutes in traffic when you can walk there in under ten or ride a bike in just under five, now if that sounds like great logic to you then great; if you are like the majority of people in this current day and age then you would not need to feel the erdge to drive, you would rather ride a bike and feel the breeze of the fresh crisp air in your hair.

The new trend of living is here, more and more communities are popping up that are car free. As the first source has stated ""...70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here."" more and more people are deciding to not own a car or even to just sell their cars so that way it is not a burden on their shoulders to maintain the cars. Most of the people who decide to give up their cars say it's a much happier way to live.

Some countries are even putting a ban on driving on certain days like paris did in source two. It stated that ""...motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine."" This ban went on for roughly five days for the smog cleared enough for all to resume preferd ways of transportation.

In colombia the government made a car-free day so that way more people would get comforatable with finding alternate ways or commuting said in the third source ""car-free day is spinning into a big hit Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. All in all more and more nation and people are deciding to go car free for good. Maybe you wil catch on and join in on this car free lifestyle.",1,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In this article ""The challenge of exploring Venus"" talks about Venus and how it might be worthy to pursuit. The first secion is going to be about how well it talks about Venus and earth. Second is about how venus is worth learning about even though it is dangerous.

The first paragraph talks about common facts about Venus also leads in with a fun fact, also the first paragraph leads into the second. In the second paragraph it explains what were going to talk about in detail also more facts about Venus. Also says why we don't send a spacecraft into unmanned.

In the article it talks about how dangerous it is. In the first paragraph it says ""almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets the planet"". Also mentions that the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Also talks about the condissions it is in, like extreme temperature, gravity is 50 times more, metal would liquidfy, and a submarine would be crushed.

In the end we still are not on it yet but we have yet to give up. We might find a way to land on it and also live on Venus with those extreme conditions. We have always found a way and we will on this problem to. So don't give up and keep on finding a way.",1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"'' Why You Should Join the Seagoing Cowboys''

You should join Seagoing Cowboys, because you get to all over the world and you might not be able to do that if you don't join.Joining is more then just an adventure it made me see the world in a different way.Also you are helping our country and many more.UNRRA hired us to take care of horses, young cows, and mules.

Also we don't work the whole time we also play games like baseball,volleyball, table tennis tournaments, boxing, fencing, reading,whittling,and much more. We visit other towns, we went to China and Europe. We saw Italy and excvated a castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal.

Working at my Aunt Katie's helped me get prepared for the Seagoing Cowboys.So do have any places where you could prepare for this?

So you should join for reason like you'll get to places that you would not be able to go. You'll be helping our country and other countries.You don't just work the whole time we play games to. It's made me see the world in a different way and

it may make you see it a diffrent way too.",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It isn't fair to let someoe vote for someoe and then for said someone that that they voted for swing and vote for someone else that the person didn't lean to vote for. In my own opinion, we should get rid of the Electoral College, because we sometimes do not get what we voted for.

Why have electoral votes that may not get the president you want? In paragraph nine of Source Two it states how over sixty percent would prefer a direct election. So the question is, why not do it? Sixty out of one hudred percent would prefer it, so why not atleast give it a try? Having a whole state have to decide what party to choose from doesn't seem fair. Ifwe had a direct election, then the President with the most votes out of the whole country would be the rightful President. It seems as if the Electoral College isn't quite acurate.

Getting rid of the Electoral College would change the U.S. a lot. It hopefully would be a good change. If it was gone, we could all hope that we would get whom we wated in office by a direct election. In paragrapgh four-teen, Source Two, it says that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The outdated part of that sentence is true. The electoral College was enforced in 1888 and has since been used by voters today. It's time for a change and a direct election should be that change. What is so bad that could happen?

The Winner-Take-All method would be gone. Voting in an Electoral College is like voting for your vote to have the most votes, like in school, you want to pick what game you play so you vote and whatever has the most, you play. Except in voting for Presidency your vote goes to whatever your state has the most of. Which seems unfair. You basically just vote to vote, so It's only a big win for you if what party you voted for is what your state goes with.

The staes determine who is the President during an election. The electoral votes have an effect on the state. 538 electors throughout the whole country. A majority of 270 electoral votes are required to elect the president. According to Source One, your state is entilted to how many members in cogress you have, plus two for each senator. So you the voter have no say on what party they all decide to lean towards. But in a direct election, your vote counts.

To conclude, we should all consider to try and make direct election happen. It would help your chance of the candidate the you vote for become President.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0

Someone or some, but a lot are curious, it is what makes us human, thinking of doing or having the challenge in us. Wouldn't it be amazing to to discover what Venus has in store? Venus could have things that we never thought of could exist, this makes the progress worth knowing. This made me feel curious of knowing more about it, One day knowing what scientist have discovered in planet Venus could be something amazing.

The danger that comes along with worth studing venus seems better not to try to move on with our lifes and stop trying to explore venus. But has that stopped people doing amazing things despite the danger it comes along with it? People have climbled all the way to the top of

I had just explained how Ihad joined a group called the Seagoing Cowboys to my good friend Bobby. I was trying, and trying to convince him to join but, he wouldn't budge.

""Trust me Bobby, it is so much more than that. You'd get to go with me and many other great men, traveling from coast to coast, and sailong sea after sea. We get to explore so many fascinating places and see so many pieces of beautiful architecture."" I told him.

"Hello my name is Ben I am a scientist at NASA, I have been discussing the face on mars with someone who believes it was created by aliens. I have read the Article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", and I have gathered some information and in my opinion I think the face was created by natural causes and is a natural landform. Here are some of my reasons.

My first reason why i think it is a natural land form is because as stated in paragraph three of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" ""huge rock formatiom . . . which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'' By saying this they say that the face is meerly an angle with odd shadows making the illusion of a human face.

My second reason is in paragraph 5 which states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" By saying that the conspiracy theorists are completely controdicted and the NASA supporters are agreeing with them and saying yeah it would be good if there were actuallty life on mars and making it possative on their part.

My third reason is in Paragraph 7 which states that ""Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."" The team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. And the photos revealed a natural land form, and there was no alien monument after all. This shows that at the time the lack of high-tech cameras and technology made the landform resemble a human face. But not everyone was satisfied.

Some may argue and say ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. But NASA went back and took another look at Cydonia on a ""cloudless summer day"" with their absolute maximum resolution camera and captured an extraordinary photo. But the photo contained no alien life forms as stated in paragraph 11 ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion the face on mars is really just a natural landform, and stated in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" said Garvin. Those are all of the reasons why i think the ""Face on Mars"" is actually just a natural landform.",3,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,1
"Have you ever considered joining the Seagoing Cowboys program? You get to go across the sea to Greece,Europe, and China. The other thing you get to do is help people out from the war. It is an adventure you get to go on. If you go on this trip you get to see animals and play games.

You should join this program because it will be a fun adventure for yourself and your kids. You get to go around the world to help other people. You also get to visit Greece,Europe,and China. You get a tour around all these places. You will never forget this memory of adventuring around the world.

There is a lot of fun parts about this adventure. First off you get to meet new people and learn their language. Another reason why it is fun is because you get to play games in the empty holds after they unload the animals. Most people go because that they want to help out the people that lost most of their stuff in the war. What if you lost all your stuff in a fire,wouldn't you want help from other people. That is how these people feel when they do not get help.

They need help and we can help with that. We can send food over to them and we can build shelters to help them out. Luke wanted to do this for the people and that is what you should do too. When there is war people die and some of those people have family at home waiting for their return and some do not return home at all. If that happened to your family how would you feel?

You will be glad if you go on this trip. You will have so much fun with your kids or by yourself. You get to do things other people can not do because they do not have cars or do not have enough money to get done there to aboard the ship. Have you ever been to Europe,Greece,or China .

"I will be discussing how I feel about how driverless cars can either help or hurt how we live our individual lives. I think that it falls into both categories but I still belive that it is more than a risk than a reward. In the paragraph the author does manage to show negative affects and more positive affects. He did not talk about how they can contribute to laziness in humans or how they can probably be dangerous for some people to drive.

Now I will agree that driverless cars could be a groundbreaking invention, but in that it will just make the world lazier. If we can just have cars take us where we want to go and then just lay back or text people on cellular phones than the invention would just be another way to contribute to laziness for huamns in the United States. Now in paragraph 2 the author talks about how google have driverless cars that can drive without crash for a half a millon miles and can alert human drivers when they are going to hit something or back into something. What bout when driverless cars become legal for people of all ages, that would probably contribute to a rate of kids who run away from home, to be able to go where ever they want to go by simply putting in where they want to go.

In conclusion, driverless cars may be able to adapt to its surroundings but what about its contribution to laziness. It would most likely be able to be used for teenagers and probably kids who feel the need to runaway from home. I believe that driverless cars would leave a negative impact. This will be coming recently as of late if Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan actually plan to make cars that requires no driver.",2,2,1,0,0,1,1,1,0
"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System could be a valuable tool in the classroom. This technology could help teachers teach efficiently in a classroom. It could tailor the learning experience so that each student's feelings are interpreted and addressed properly. This could also help online learning systems by giving easier questions or explaining things with more depth when certain faces are made.

The facial expression for each emotion is universal. Different muscles make different faces to show different emotions. Facial muscle movement can even show mixed emotions. With the new technology a person's face is compared to and judged by neutral faces. This can help identify and distinguish specific emotions, and make it easier to get inside a student's head.

Another benefit of using computers to determine feeling is being able to tailor learning to an individual's feelings. The computers can recognize feelings like disgust, confusion, and boredom. This way it can be known if a teacher's lesson becomes too cumbersome, or if the teacher doesn't explain things quite right. Then they can know when they need to slow down and take a little more time with the topic, and therefore teach students more effectively.

Online learning or learning from a computer would benefit as well. Teachers can identify different emotions in different students. Humans can sort of ""calculate"" different emotions ourselves. If a student is learning from a computer it can be difficult to adjust the lesson to the student's needs. If the computer can recognize different emotions then it could try to present the information in different preset ways. If the student is bored the computer could give a humorous example to explain the problem or make it more interesting so that the learning process is easier. If the student appears confused the computer could slow down and go over the past few things it just taught. This could help make sure that each individual student can understand the information that it is trying to teach to them.

Another good reason to read students' emotions is that it could be beneficial as research. It could help scientists gather data about a student's feelings towards the thing they're learning. Having us understand students' emotions and categorizing them as data could help us take a step back, and look at the way students across the world are being taught.This could help us decide if we need to change things about it to make it a more fun, interesting, and informative process.

That is why I think it could be valuable to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify students' emotions in the classroom. it could help both teachers and computers teach more effectively. It could also be useful in a study on students' feelings towards school, different classes and informatiom they're learning, and maybe even different traits that well liked teachers might possess. Regardless of what particular application it has I think it would just be interesting to see the different emotions of students, and how the computer software works.",4,3,2,3,2,3,2,2,3
"I will be taking about the Unmasking the Face on

"Dear Senator,

I feel the need to eliminate the Electoral College process of voting and just have a regular election where the President with the most votes wins, as simple as that. Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population.

Just like Source 2, I feel ""The Electroal College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "" ""Abolish the electroal college!"". When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President"" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swing-states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had.

In Source 1, it says how ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! So people can vote for an elector thinking that he's going to vote for the Republican party but then he votes for the Democratic party. This process can be very misleading. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."". The disaster factor as mentioned in Source 2 could aways occur.

Some counter-arguments might include the certainty of outcome, and how the Electoral Vote might be greater than the Popular Vote. But at the end of the day, the people are nominating their president, they don't want others to do it for them. The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority.

So, hopefully you see my view on this issue and the Electoral College can be eliminated.

Sincerely,

Gabe",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2

Not only that you get to tend to animals and help out. You also get to have a great feeling in your heart knowing you got to help.

As from the story you see how truly great it is to do this. Not interested yet well there is a chance when you are 18 years old you do not have to be drafted off to war,they may just have you do this. Now that you see that reason I bet I got your attention.

So when you do this not only do you get to have a great feeling in your heart knowing you helped, but you also get to see wonderful sights everywhere you look,and get to tend to soft fluffy animals that are so cute day in and day out,and who knows you may not even have to be drafted they may just have you do this only.

"The electoral college is a symbol of mockery and deprivation of our rights. Voting using this system to elect our leaders is proven null and serves to be removed. Implementing the popular vote in society will not only modernize it but give america its full name for democracy. For many years presidency has debated its ability to be renounced from Electoral college votes or the popular vote. The electoral college is a symbol of our rights as a US citizen being swept under our feet. More formally, this needs to be changed so the people of the U.S can have a greater say in our government, and those who run the country. Granting this power, we will not only modernize but become more democratic(Plumer-Paragraph-9).

According to the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, Not only do citizens agree with changing our system our own appointees do to. Major figures in politics like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole and the U.S Chambe or commerce all agree to the abolishment of electoral college voting privaleges. A poll of over 6/10 voters agree that a direct election should be implemented by the people. This topic can be contreversal though. The best argument that reinstates its purpose says "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". So whats the contreversy about we elect them so they elect what we want. The best argument against this is the disaster factor. In the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing democratic electors by electing electors who oppose John F. Kennedy(Plumer-Paragraph-10-11)

There are numerous factors that contribute towards the banishment of the Electoral College. Ranged from the favoritism of big states with big populations hence the higher amount of electoral votes, to the possibility of a tie in electoral votes. The system is unfair and a symbol of non modern democracy. Direct voting offers a chance to citizens of the US the ability to exercise voting and become part of the government in which we follow. If we always lived in this system, improvements must go on as time progresses so we as a nation can improve to become better. Changing our government is just another major step in our progress to becoming the most sucessful nation.

Changing our system so the voters of the US governize america by direct election is a essential change. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" numerous stories have been told that the Electoral college is an act of anachronism(Posner-Paragraph-15). If the people of the US work hard to remove this we can modernize society forever and make US a better democracy. If we fail to do so, we risk taking a major step backwards in time causing another seggregation act. We have been deprived of many of our rights for too long throughout history and now we have the ability to change. The electoral college has been a shaded act of seggregation and need to dperived of its rights and shut down at a notice.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Transpotation has been a key part of many socities around the world today; from getting to and from jobs, visiting familes, and running common everyday errands that life brings. But, in some areas, they are opting to go car-free, and in many ways, it is making positive impacts within these evolving areas. From lowering emissions and greenhouse gases, to providing a more stress-free way of living, opting out on cars can make huge positve effects that everyone should look into.

Cars, especially in the United States and other leading nations, have many suburban ideals that bring them to have one of ""the world's prime car cultures"". The U.S, for example, is the birthplace of the Model T, one of the first cars that was ever made. However, over the last decade, America's love for cars has gone down slightly, and is headed lower each year. Looking into the future, this shift could have great affects on today's socities; which includes letting off fewer carbon emissons into the enviornment. This decrease would happen because transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions into the atmosphere, just behind Power Plants. Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gases in  Lowering the amount of car emissions will additionally help achieve President Obama's goals of helping the enviornment and doing something good towards it during his time as President.

In addition, France is a prime example of how lowering the amount of cars on streets will have positive outcomes on the enviornment. Because of excessive amounts of smog in air in Paris, they came up with a clever system to reduce the amounts. An alternate day schedule is what was put in place, allowing motorists with even numbered license plates to drive one day, and odd-numbered drivers the next. Failure to leave their cars at home on the days that don't apply to them resulted in a 22-euro fine, which didn't stop some drivers. But, despite their reactions, the idea had many postive impacts and cleared the air of smog. Countries all around the world have seen the impressive facts come to life that reducing driving can lower the amount of emissions we put into the enviornment.

Limiting the amount of cars on the road also has other advantages other than the postive impacts it can make on the enviornment. Germany, for example, is experimenting by forbidding street drving, driveways, and home garages near the french and swiss borders (Vauban). As a result, 70% of Vauban's families do not even own cars and 57% sold a car to move there. One resident says ""When I had a car I always always tense. I'm much happier this way"". This idea shows how being car-free can lower stress levels",3,2,2,3,1,1,1,1,1

have you ever heard of the greenhouse affect, global warming and air pollution? the abundant usage of cars have a large affect on those vital things in our environment . In cities like paris , because of the air pollution caused by cars, there is very dense smog ( source2 ).

According to the passage, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" I can agree with Mona Lisas demonstraion that, If a classroom compter could see your emotions, I think the information on the web will be much more interesting until the computer sees that your emotions are acceptable. Havin this computer software, kids and adults of all levels can read people more easily and try to help them. Wether its in school or at home. Kids can learn easier and understand more with this computer software. In passage 6, ""Most human communicaton is non verbal, including emotional communication,"" Dr. Huang has a good point. Most human communication is non verbal and hard to read emotions. Having to see or tell will have a lot more communication. Less problems will suddenly appear. In conclusion, The use of this technology could be helpful becuase it will help people understand students ouside of school and inside of school. Students will become smarter because a computer ad can make sure they get better information if they arent interested. Teachers would would have an easier time teaching as well.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"You should join the program called the United Nations Relief and Rehbititation Administration. Because the program is for countries that needing help after World War 11 was over.

This program will bring all the thing such as animals, food supplieds and much more to help the countries get what they need. You get to go on a cattle-boat trip to different places around the world that need help because of the War that hit those places. You get to feed the animals on the boat you have to clean the stales that they are in and you get to you don't just have to work you get to play different games and see different places.

This program will mean a lot to the people in the different counttry that you are doing this for them and could make you feel better that you helped someone in a different county that got hit by the War so this is a really good opportunity that could last a life time.

"Do students have to express there feelings to a teacher? Have all teenagers exprees their emotions to there parents? Have you ever pretended to be happy but was angry inside? Did you watch horror movies and get emotional when the main character died?

Would emotional expressions of students in a classroom be valuble. No it wouldn't be valuble students have personal issues and wouldn't be comfortable showing its emotional expression. For instance in the text it says,"" Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa,""(Para4). If a person trying to cover there expressions from people why is the technology trying to read there expression?

Next, A person that looks happy on the outside, most likely sad in the inside. In the text it says,"" Eckman has classified six basics emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles,""(Para3). Sometimes it's good that the technology have invented things to make the students speak up about what's going in there lives. Text says,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored,""(para6). That sentence tells a lot because the technology is trying to keep students on track knowing if there slacking on there work or getting bored on important lessons.

Lastly, Don't judge a book, by it's cover. A student can look bored but really want to lean what's going in the classroom. According to the text,"" The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" obsereves Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expressions,""(para4). The expreesions for the emotion are not going to be One Hundred percent right but it will have signs if you are angry or happy. The technology will have a lot errors, to it getting emotions incorrect, making students intimidated.

"Transportation is a must in today's society, and car usage plays a big role in the subject. Limiting car usage has many advantages. Reduced usage of cars can help the enviroment in various ways. Less car usage can help citizens be less dependent on cars, and can be a great stress reliever for others.

The enviroment is a big part of the lives of people and needs to be taken care of. Cars are known for polluting the air and damaging the enviroment. One of the problems about the air pollution involves greenhouse gas emissions. In the article (""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal), Paragraph 5 states ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". Limiting car usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Smog is another issue due to car usage. Paris is a known city for smog. In the article (""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer), it says ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... [Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."", meaning that smog is a big problem in the enviroment. Air pollution can be reduced with limited car usage and can help the enviroment in which we live in. Being independent can be one of the many benefits of limited car usage.

Relying on car usage can put people at a disadvantage. Limiting car usage can help citizens become less reliant on automobiles. Paragraph 20 states ""BOGOTA,Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" (Source 3, Andrew Selsky). There are many differents ways of using transportation without having to rely on car usage. Jobs and businesses can be accessible through many alternative choices of transportation. Source 4, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, states ""He and I have similar obsercations about our children. Mine (19 and 21) have not bothered to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They are interested, but it's not a priority. they organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk of take public transportation or car-pool with friends."" (paragraph 39). Different Transportaion routes, or options, gives a wider variety of getting somewhere. Limited car usage can help citizens be more independent with transportation. Limited Car usage can be a way of relieving stress.

Citizens believe that limited car usage gives them the advantage of relieving stress. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1, Paragraph 3). Reduced car usage can cause a fellow citizen to feel happier. Paragraph 35 of Source 4 says ""The Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" Citizens feel more connected with friends without the neccessity of car usage. Less Driving impacts the lives of citizens in a postive way.

Limited car usage can only be seen as an advantage, it brings out many positive things. Reduced Car usage is Enviroment friendly and reduces air pollution. Less driving is a better way of being independent and stress-free. The world can be a better place with limited use of automobiles.",3,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear, Senator

The

Electoral college has been around for centuries and as time changes, things start to evolve and grow along with the time period.

Some things are meant to be changed according to the lifestyle of our people now. Hundreds of years back, the electoral college might have worked for the citizens living during that time. However, this is a new century and many people agree with the fact that the electoral college is out dated and we need to change to the election by popular vote. Firstly, because the people are putting their vote into the hands of a person whom they might not even consider the votes of their state's people . Also, the electoral college causes many issues duing the voting period.

To start off, The electoral college is a huge risk that the state's people must take each year.

You never know whether or not your electors will suddenly change their mind and vote for a candidate that you personally didn't want. In the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" Bradford Plumer states ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Plumer Paragraph 10) What the author is explaining is that during the presidential election, once you vote on your selection for the next president and you give your vote to the state electors you never know if they might change their mind or get scared and choose the incorrect candidate. For example, you choose on Barack Obama for president and you give your vote to the state electors and when it's time to vote... they decide to switch and choose

HILARY CLINTON!

Many of the citizens who voted for Barack Obama are now outraged by the thought of their state electors doing such a thing.

If we had elections by popular vote we would be able to choose whom we specifically want for our President and there wouldn't be so much tension between people.

Furthermore, the article ""The indefensible electoral college: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system ae wrong"" Bradford explains ""Back in 1960, Segregationists in the Louisinna legislaure nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors whoo would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This quote from the article is saying that the electors could easily manipulate you and change their votes in order to get what they want, forgetting about all the other votes of the people back home waiting for the news that their selection has won the presidency.

The elecoral college completely demolishes the purpose of the people's vote.

Additionally, electoral colleges should be abolished because not everyone feels as strongly about it as they did hundreds of years ago when the process first came about. What had started out as a good idea has slowly turned into a unpredictable disaster. From time to time,

People would be let down when they find out that  the candidate they had chosen didn't win the election, Why? because their state electors decided that it was okay for them to simply go against everyone else and be selfish by choosing their own candidate for presidency.

Bradford proves this by explaining ""...'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" (Plumer Paragraph 11) On multiple occasions voters have done exactly that, choosing someone completely different than whom they were supposed to. Many members of the party get angry with such childish behavior because it's selfish, uncalled for, and just disrespectful to go about ignoring the one major duty they had to cast a vote for their selected candidate. The article ""In defense of the electoral college: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president"" Richard A. Posner exclaims ""The electoral college is widely regarded as a anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner."" (Posner Paragraph 15) What the author is explaining is that the electoral college is an old custom and it's time that it was changed to something new like the election by popular vote.

Time has changed, an so has the political veiws. The election by popular vote is a better opportunity because the state's people get to vote on exactly who they want without any major risks to deal with later on. Also, the election by popular vote is a simple and easier way of electing president.

On the other hand, there are very few reasons that are pointing towards the electoral college being a good idea. For example,

The electoral college has a even number of votes which make it easier to have a more predictable outcome of who might win the election. Although, not everyone might get the candidate that they had hoped for originally. The electoral college also comes along with the ""Winner-take-all"" method in which the awarding electoral votes induces the candidates running for the presidency.

However, this is only based on the candidate that has the most popular votes.

There are various reasons to consider the electoral college but many of them are followed by an overload of reasons

NOT

to keep the electoral college in use.

Lastly, the election by popular vote should be used instead of the electoral college. The electoral college comes along with many complications and difficulties unlike the election by popular vote it has a simple and easier way of choosing who you want in the next presidency. Many people feel that you should change over to the election by popular vote to benefit all of the state's people so that they can have a more acurrate estimation of who they  might have as their new president.

According to Bradford, the electoral college is ""...Unfair, outdated, and irrational."" (Plumer paragraph 14) It's about time we got rid of it and changed the way we elected our new president.",5,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Dear Florida State Senator,

I belive that we should change the way presidents win the election. I dont think it sould be based on what the House of representatives and Senators think. It should be based on popular vote by the citizens. After all, isn't about what the people want.

What is the Electoral College? ""The Electoral College is a process, not a place.""

(Source 1, section 1.)

It was a compromise between congress and the citizens, formed by the founding fathers. In the Electoral College there are 538 electors. Just over half of the congress has to agree for one, to be elected President. In the end it doesn't matter what the citizens want. Who ever gets more votes in the Electoral College, wins presidency.

Why do I not agree with the Electoral College? I do not agree with the Electoral College because, for example take Al Gore. He would have on won presidency by citizens popular vote if it hadn't been for the Electoral College. ""Over 60 precent of Americas voting population, would prefer a direct election.""

(Source 2, section 9.)

I also belive it isn't fair to smaller states. Electoral College is based on your states population. You have small states like Alaska and Hawii who only have 3 or 4 electoral votes and other larger states like Texas and Florida who have 29 or 38 Electoral votes. The candidates running for president go to large states more so than small states, because they know that if they persuade the big states the will the election. ""The Electoral College may turn off potentail voters for a canidate who has no hope of carrying their state.""

(Source 3, section 23.)

This causing not alot of people to vote in larger states.

Overall the Electoral College is not a good method for electing the Pesident. The Electoral College is unfair, non-useful and outdated. Its sad because everyone who votes, thinks that their one vote matters. News flash, because of the Electoral College it doesnt matter!",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,1
"So you think that aliens created the face that is on Mars? That is funny, there hasn't been any sign of aliens found yet anywhere. The shape made is most likely a cowensidence. It is also made up from shadows that are on the planet.

If you look in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it will tell some of the facts that are givin in the paragraph above. My team at NASA were deffinitly in shock,we had thought that it looked like a egytion head. We observed it for a minit and then laughed it off. But like I said before it is an elosion and it was just shadows that were on the planet. I am guessing that some of the featers are also from craters on the planet.

Im going to take a shot in the dark and say that you most likely thought it was from aleins becuase you have seen it on TV and you have to beleave every thing on Telivision. Well what about this,the weather man said it was supposed to be rainy out side and was going to have a temperture of 45 degrees,well it is bright out side and 70 degrees. Are you seing my point now? The movie you might see might have something that seems to be very full of facts and might seem real but anyone can do that but still lie.

Some people said Neal Armstrong was fake and a set up on Telivisoin,just for show you might say. But we have evidence ulike you. We have photo graphs and things that came off of the planet. Don't you dare try to argue with someone that knows what they are talking about and has worked in this kind of inviroment. You might not beleave it but you have to learn things from the past that happened at the station and things that have been descovered,so that you don't think that you found something new but in reality you are trying to do reaserch on something from long ago. Now tell me again why you think a fictional character would have made a face on a planet. Ohh yes thats wright becuase you can sit on a coach and beleave some shiny screen tryed telling you. Now does that mean you really think you think something like Big foot also egsist. Does that mean that you saw that movie Planet of the Apes and thought that there might be a planet that apes rule a world and have humans work for them. You seem like a bit of a fool if you think that,that would be true. Come on use a bit of common since and past knowledge. Didn't you ever pay attention in school?",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you ever dreamed about exploring space? I know I have when wierd shapes or forms appear on things and places in our solar system people believe it aliens or a foriegn species that we know nothing about. Like in 1976 a global surveyor named the Viking snapped a photo of a landform that look likes a face on the planet called Cydonia. Humans always argue among each other over the fact whether it was made by aleins or just a natural landform. It's and natural landform beacause it could of been caused from a piece of another planet branching of and crashing, or regular elements acting apon the planet itself.

Our solar system is huge there is alot of planets, and more uknown things humans do not know about. Many things can be floating around in outer space from other planet bigger or smaller. The peice of that planet or object broke off of could had of entered Cydonia atmosphere, and caused that landform to exist.

Many things have difrent ways of cleansing, and many other different ways of doing things. We do not know if the planet Cyndia caused the unsual lamdform itself from amy kid of element storms and much more.

The planet Cyndia is very rare with the landform it has own it there could be many more planets and unknown things that have rare landforms about them in the big solar system,",1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Do you think there is a face on Mars created by aliens on Cydonia? Lets talk about it. Cydonia is a huge red planet. Better stated in pargraph one, ""An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the camera from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia."" On this beautiful reddish planet, people thought there was a human face carved in it. They do not know how, and they do not know who did it.

What did people see on this great sized planet? People saw a face, with shadows forming human face features! After Nasa had generously let the images on display for everyone to see, it became a huge news story. Everyone was, as said, talking about the unspecified ""Face on Mars"". The word was soon sent out by everyone ,and the public was attract to what they had seen in the picture of mars! The public went balistic after seeing such an amazing picture!

What did NASA and scientists say about this human looking face? They had said it was just a natural created landform! When they flew over the beautiful Cydonia to snap a better picture of ""The Face"" that was sharper, they had said, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Not everyone had agreed with what they had said, which cause a comotion. Other people had said they were clearly oblivious to the alien markings hidden by the haze. Which then, NASA had to send more people to look at the face once more.

What had happened the second time they send people to search ""The Face."" Well, they had a little bit of trouble this time around! They had said, it was not easy, and It had been very hard work. They also said, in paragraph 9, ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" Next, they found a great cloudless summer day to finally search Cydonia. There team had caught an ""Extraordinary photo usimg the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Their picture had been 100x better the second time around! They stated, ""Well, If there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, If were unseen aliens on Cydonia, they would most likely know about it! It would have been very,very clear to see aliens after they used their 1.56 meter pixel size.

Lastly, they stated in the article, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as ""The Face"" on Mars.""",2,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Some students don't shre there emotions because something bad or wrong happened in there life they don't want to talk about. Why bring it out of them with technology?

In paragragh 7 it gives intrusctions on what to do when looking in the mirror. Then goes on to talk about how those intrusctions show a happy face and what those muscle actions show if a person shows a genuine smile or a foced smile. If a person was told to follow those instructions wouldn't that be considered a forced smile. What if a student has a bad day during school and in a lab they have to follow these instuctions in a mirror that would be a foced smile. I think that we should not deal with others emotions or try to figure them out because it there life and if they want to let there emtions out they can. Im not trying to say that you should keep your emotions inside and struggle with them. Im saying that a person shouldn't be watched all the time and studied to find there emotions. In paragraph 6 it talks about in an example if you smile or forwn in a Web ad when it appears on your screen a similar follows or changes. Most poeple hate ads poping up on there screen so why make more pop up according to your emotions. A person with an ad popping up made be fine the frist time, but when it happens over and over again the person may get upset or angry because the ads ar changing his/her emotions.

Emotions should be left alone or delt with at the right time, not monitored all the time. I think this technology is an invastion of privacy in a way. People should live there life how they want to live it and if they want there emotions being monitored they can, but if not they have the right to refuse.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Cars are a luxury, but others take them for granted. Many people around the world operate cars every single day! Very few people around the world do not own a car, or have never operated one. In Vauban, Germany, residents of an upscale, high class community have decided to give up on cars. Vauban's steets are entirely ""car-free"" - except the in the city where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge of the community. Don't get Germany wrong, you are allowed to own a car, but there's very few places to park the car you own. The only placed you can park are large garages at the end of your neighborhood or development, but parking isn't free here. You must buy a space for $40,000, along with the price of your home. 70 percent of Vauban's citizens do not own cars, and 57 percent alone sold their car to move there. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and a mother of two. Vauban, Germany completed in 2006, is an excellent example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States, and other places to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning."" - According to Elisabeth Rosenthal who wrote, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.""

Cars can either be a blessing or a mistake. Cars can tend to put out polluting gases, and endanger our earth. In Paris, all driving was banned due to smog. On a Monday, motorisits with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. The same would apply to the odd-numbered plates the following day. The car emissions were trapped by a warmer layer of air, because of cold nights and warm days. Congestion in Paris, France wa down 60 percent after just five-days of intensifying snog. This caused the smog to rival Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. That's pretty bad to be competing with China. The Monday where all cars were banned, the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates the following day.

Now, what about a car free day? In Bogota, Colombia, there was a car free day. Every citizen either had to hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work during this car-free day. This car free day caused the city to not have any traffic jams, and no accidents at all. This isn't just the first year that Colombia decided to do this, but it was the third! This day is specifically called, ""Day Without Cars."" 7 million citizens were expected to find a different way to go to the destinations they needed to reach, without their trusty cars. Bogota receives a vast amount of rain storms each day, but the turnout was still at large. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus. Many citizens of Bogota said that this day takes away not only their stress, but also a ton of pollution. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he and his wife rode a two-seat bicycle.

Almost every single citizen in the United States of America owns or drives a car every single day. This has left researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed the peak of driving? The United States is known for its broad expanses and suburban ideals, and has long been known for one of the world's prime car cultures. It is indeed the birthplace of Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally."" Lately America's love addiction with motor vehicles seems to be settling down. As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 8 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Most of the explanation to this certainly comes from recession, because broke Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before the downturn,"" said Michael Sivak, who studies the trend and who is a research professor at the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute. ""I think that means something more fundamental is going on,"" he also said. All of these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession need to find reasons NOT to resume the habit of driving and spending stupid amounts of money on gasoline. The state of New York has a new bike-sharing programs and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls refelct those new priorities, as do a proliferation of car-sharing programs across the nation. A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

Many people around the world have cut driving out of their life for many reasons. Some being; safety, money, and pollution. If you had to choose between driving or public transportation to make the littlest difference in your community, what would you choose?",3,1,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Do you think driveless cars are dangerous if so why? I think driveless cars are a better oppournity for drivers to get around easier, sensor and safer! The driver could get around easier instead using brake when stop or either steer the wheel when its hard to turn. In the text it says "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". Drivless cars could help you through difficult times even if you drive past road rage!

Driverless cars technology is a good idea I think because it has an sensor! It tracks what your feeling or what you could detect while your in the car driving In the text it says ""Fruther improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" The idea of having the a sensor sense you when your in danger or need of help if your car breaks down is another postive impact of driverless car. The sensor contains deep inside the car for example the creation of the speeding of antilock brakes. Smarter manufacturers turned to smarter cars because not only the speed of the brakes but the engine can be reduce power and allowing for better response and control than a human druver could manage alone.

Driverless cars as can detected whether your in danger or not! Safety is important if you have an automated car driving you! Who knows what the case maybe? In the text it says "" GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" Referring when the vehicle sense another car been touch the car automate is going to be aware something is wrong. The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Driverless cars manuafacturers are aslo safer because inside the car while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver!

The manufactures is driverless cars is not only a good service of work with making cars but different oppournities could be with just testing out how things would be different with someone controlling the car! Its like the car knows where to take the driver as soon as someone sit in the driver seat. The smart idea of the gps of the car is a good motive for the driver just have to seat back and relax! The driverless car still alert the driver to take over when pulling or may pulling out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. Autonomous car is a good way with not dealing with car wrecks or even navigating through roadwork.

Another impressive thing is the law depend on the driver to always mistakes or either just going over the speed limit! That is never the case with driverless car As stated above safety is acheived witht he alerted driver. Presently, the law thinks assumption of the driverless car is safe car human in control at all times. The law still change the laws, will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.",3,3,3,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Can you picture life without cars ? In today society cars are our only transporatation, well in the U.S. it is. many different places around the world are beginning to use other ways to get around from place to place. This are some reasons why cars should be limited usaged because you can save more money, you save more time, and you become more happier and less tense and stress.

To begin with, In paris people are to save more money not having cars because of smog. Smog fine citizens for even or odd numbers on their license plates. A quote from the passage states ""the goal is to promote alternative transporation and reduce smog. Violators faced $25 fines."" This quote shows how citizens really feel about cars, they want more transportation outlets and to ban cars so they can save more money.

Next, Picture being stuck in traffic late to work only becuase it was probaly a car accident or maybe the road is getting constructed. A good way to avioding traffic is to use other source of transporation. It saves you more money and less time. This also improve the safety of the people beaucse fewer accident can be avioded. Most accidents happen becuase of rushing to get to work or school. for exable from the passge states"" he proposed partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian"", bicycle, privatecars... are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resouces, lower emissions and improve safety."" I agree with this quote because it gives you reason to imporve the way me save our money and hepls make our environment safe.

Last, Study show that more people who don't have car are more happy then people who have cars. the reason that is, is because people who dont have cars don""t have to worrie about car insurance and car payments. People who dont drive become less tense and stress. A quote from the passage states "" when i had a cae i  was always tense.

We should be changing to the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Everyone should just vote for the vice president and the president. People are voting for the Electoral college while they should be voting to see who will be their new president. The electoral college is getting more votes than the president should be getting. Insead of having to have about 270 eletoral votes they should just see which president gets the most votes.

Therfore, the eletoral college mut be stopped and we shall just vote for the presient and vice president. The president should be able to be president for 5 years if they reach a good amount of votes. With eletoral college its sometimes hard to chose the president because they are getting tied with the eletoral votes. I say that the president and the electers should be the ones to pick the vice president. The vice president shall approve of the president also.

Also if someone is running for president and the other person wins they shouldn't be upset because they still will get another chance. One reason some people chose to have the electoral vote is because the president is winning everything. And the electoral college requires a presidental candidate. To them the president isn't their president. The winner/ the president gets all the awards and receive the most infromation. Bigger states are getting more attention the all other states. Some states are not getting any votes at all. Also candidates are getting the same amount of votes, but differnent amount of electoral vote. They want to see who gets the most votes to be the president the most electoral votes. People vote so they can have a perference.

In conclusion, we should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. The president should be easier to chose and should be chosen equally and fairly.",1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The author is evaluating how to explore Venus because it is the most familiar planet to Earth. But he is up in the air about trying to do some reasearch on the planet Venus because they have sent aircrafts to the planet before but none of them have been able to topuch down on Venus.

First, scientist have thought the planet Venus was covered in large oceans at one point in time and could support various life forms on the planet. in the text it says, ""Venus has a big gas ring around the atmosphere."" This is showing that it makes it harder for NASA to land on Venus because of the gas that surrounds the planet.

Next, NASA has thought about sending an aircraft to Venus but they have ran into some problems on the way. One of the problems they have ran into is that they cant get close enough to the planet to get any samples or even see whats on the ground. In the text it says, ""At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth."" This is showing that none of the equimpment that NASA has is strong enough to get close to Venus.

In conclusion, NASA has not been able to find a way to get close enough to Venus to do any work or get any samples of the planet. But they are working on making a metal strong enought to last a long period of time left on the planet.",2,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To begin with, the electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president abd vice president, and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral college consist of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president. Each candidate running for presisent in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen bt the candidate's political party.

In addition, the presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in november. You can help choose tour state's electors when you vote for predident.  Most states have a ''winner-take-all'' system however, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ''proportional representation.'' Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in tuen elect the president. The single best argument aganist the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. It's like a hurricane for a presidental election. Prehaps the most worring is the prospect of a tie in thre electoral vot. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

To futher inform, at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spen time in states because they no they have no chance of winning. it's like convincing pigs to vote for you. It's offical the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. It's hard to say this but Bob Doloe was right abolish the electoeal college!

The electoral college restores some of the weight in the politiccal balance that lage states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the senate decreed in the consition. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recives a majority of the votes cast. It can be argued that he electoral college method of slecting for the presisent may turn off potential voters for a candidate. But athat single vote may decide that election!",1,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I believe the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents by stating ways it could benefit the human race. I see the author use many examples of how exploring Venus will help the human race now and in the future. I think the author really believes that exploring Venus is a worthy cause.

The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is one of his many reasons why we should explore Venus, because in the future it could possibly be our new home. The author also states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various types of life."" This is yet another example the author presents to show why Venus is so worthwhile. So one of the main reasons the author believes Venus is a worthy cause despite its dangers, is because in the future it could possibly be our new home.

The author also states that

""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author means if we can get past the challenges of Venus it will allow us to face other challenges in the future. The author tells us that we should ""not be limited by dangers and doubts,"" and that we should explore into the ""very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author wants Venus to just be a stepping stone in our long journey of challenges. The author wants it to be something we overcome and get past so we can explore and learn new things.

Even with the many dangers the auhtor stated we can all see exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit. Dangers such as: 800 degree weather, the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than Earths, and the sulfuric acid clouds are some of the many challenges preventing us from exploring Venus close up. To overcome these the author hints at a need for stronger materials and a way to survive the temperatures and pressures in such an environment . But the author has hope that we will figure all of this out. The author even states that a material called silicon carbide has been tested in conditions such as Venus's and have shown to last up to three weeks. He also states that we are thinking of using old mechanical computers to send to Venus because they can be made more durable. So the authors hope for exploring Venus close up may be made into a reality.

So in conclusion the authors support of his belief that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents are strong and have many benefits. The author believes it will benfit us now and in future endeavors. There are many promising technologies being developed for this specific reason. There may be hope for exploring Venus afterall.",3,3,3,2,1,1,1,2,2
"Have you ever thought of how future cars may look like? With technolongy rapidly increasing each year, in the next couple of years cars might be the ones doing all the driving without the need of people controlling it. In other words, in the future there could be the invention of driverless cars. Now, do you think this would be a good idea or not so much? Well, in the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, the author points out a few postitive and negative features.

Since a few years ago Google modifies a Toyota car into a smarter car. A couple of these upgrades involoved the wheels to include a sensor and a Dubbed LIDAR, which allowed the driver to be constantly notifies of the car/s surrounding. This it's self is very useful. It caused the number of accidents to decrease due to the driver being constantly notified. Of course these are all examples of postiive features of a car, but do not make the car completely driverless.

Another major feature was a development called, ""Traffic Jam Assistant'. This new develpoment did not quite make the car completely driverless either. Although it did involve the driver not to control the car as much. This feature had the ability to get the driver where they needed to be as long as there was'nt any need for human skills. Even if there was'nt any need of human skills, one still had to be aware of the road. Mainly this feature made driving easier but not completely driverless.

Towards the end of the article the author points out a couple negative aspects. The author mentions that safety is best assured when the driver is in control of the car at all times. So, in reality having a driverless car would not be the best or safest idea. That is because, if complete driverless cars would come to invention the car would be completely running through technology. Technology is not always assured. The technologu that makes the car safely drive on its own may fail which will lead to an accident without the alert of the driver.

Overall, in my opinion I do not think driverless cars would be a good idea. I think it would lead the number of accidents per year increase rather than decreasing or staying stable. I do think having those new developments of technology are helpful into making the driver more caution though. These new developments still require the driver to be fully aware of the road and their surroundings. Unlike driverless cars, they would seem to allow the drivers to ""relax"". This would cause drivers not to have a quick response in case of an accident where the technololgy of the car fails or for any apparent reason. Driverless cars do sound fun and nice at first, but once you take your thoughts into more deepth I do think you would be second thinking your thoughts. Not only will this development cause one to put themselves in danger, but also other cars along the road wth them.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Imagine being on a plaet so hot that metal would melt just from the touch of it. Imagine being on a planet that has 80 times the atmospheric pressure of the Earth. Now imagine being on it. You would think that it's imppossible and that it's too risky. Well, that's only half true because scientist have now started studying on how to explore this planet. They've even gone as far as thinking of ways to allow humans to go there and study the planet themselves. A planet where metal melts by the touch and where submarines built to go to the deepest part of the ocean would get crushed, ""is it worth it?"" you may ask.

Well in the short article ""The CHallenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states that it may be worth it. In the last paragraph line 1-4, he states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This statement is basically saying that we will be on our way to even more discoveries if we manage to study Venus. Other reasons why it may be worth it to study Venus is that, there may have been life on it before earth! It has similar features that the earth has like rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientist believe that Venus long ago could've had oceans just like the Earth. This planet could've been home to various life forms just like the Earth. Scientist from NASA have also discovered that if we were to ever launch humans into space to go study the planet, there would be a safe way for them to study it as stated in paragraph 5, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles aboce the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This means that humans could study the planet but away from the burning heat of the ground on Venus and the storms.

Although, exploring Venus has it's challenges and it's dangers. Exploring this planet would work in the benefit of the Earth that we live on. Not only will it allows us to find ways to travel to other planets but to also travel safely. As the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" said ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Exploring this planet will prepare the human race for future endeavors. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"I feel like it would be a good idea to have one of these in schools because, it can one tell how a student is feeling on any certian day. Along with that it can possibly predict how a student or a teacher will react to something that happens in the school or what another person says.

It can also help the students with their work if the computer can tell that a student is struggling with their assignement, it can give them easier question but still get the point across for the class. I also backed this from the article because it mentions that a classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoing confused or bored.

Another reason I think it woud be a good idea to have these in classrooms is, there are some students that learn better on a computer and this will help them if they do not understand a subject. There is also other students that can not learn if most of there course is online and to difficult for them. So this system could possibly tell a teacher or another staff member that this student does not work well on a computer.

These are my reasons to as why I feel like it would be a good idea to have the Facial Action Coding System in a school. I feel like it can benefit some students off the jump and, I also feel like it can help some students get to where they need to be if they are struggling.",2,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"We use cars for many things. We use them for work, for getting supplies and grocures and most importantly, we use them to get places alot quicker. But cars harm are environment in some pretty bad ways. They create greenhouse emissions and Smog. Which is why the world is trying to rid itself of cars.

Cars of today and back run on gasoline which we get from fossil fuels that we get from the ground. This resource wont last forever and will eventually disapear if we keep using it. The stuff created from cars exhaust pipes damages are air supply and are environment. it creates smog in the air which is bad for the lungs to inhale. Like the people in Vauban, Germany who dont even drive cars, im sure there air is clean or atleast alot cleanier than ours is.

i Believe we should find a new solution to cars other than just removing them from use. i Believe they should produce more electric cars. Yes, it may not go along with the american dream of having a roaring engine and a blower sticking out of the hood but it will save our planet one step at a time. And being a car lover i wouldnt want to see cars go but i think a change to electric would fine and helpful.

Like it says in source 2, places like paris and bejing are some of the most poluted places in the world. If we dont find another solution to are cars its just going to get worse. The smog pollutes are air and the thick warm air traps it in our ecosystem. Alot less people are driving every year and thats good which means less harm to the planet.

I love cars wether its muscle or sport but sadly we wont be able to drive them forever unless we do something about it and make a change, a word the world is scared of. People should buy more electric cars or invest in or just not drive at all. Ride a bike or something, americans need the bike ride and im sure the rest of the world could use one too.",2,2,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Venus is often referred to as ""Earth's twin"". It is the most relatable planet in our solar system to earth. It is around the same size and has almost the same density. Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the solar system which makes it hard for the people at NASA to study it. Many years ago venus wasn't extremly hot and had many oceans which could of allowed more life to live there.

Over a decade ago NASA sent a a rocket to venus. After it being to on and them only being able to be there for a few hours they came back. NASA haven't tried to send anything thing else up to venus because they would only be able to be there for a couple hours. The surface is so hot they might not even be able to be there for that long.

NASA is thinking about sending a rocket to venus which then they would have a vehichle flow above the planet to try to study more about it. They would be around 30 miles above venus studying to micrscopes or othe devices which let them see the planet easier. With them being 30 miles above the surfave it would still be extremly hot at 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

NASA is also trying to find other way to study venus. For example they are making electronics made of silicon carbide and test them to see if it can hangle the heat and other challenges it might face. In the article the author explains that the electronics they need to study venus would be nothing like the computers people use here on earth. Studying venus is really hard and figuring out the right way to do it is the hardest part.

In conclusion we are trying to figure out how to study venus. We are coming up with multiple options that have to be perfect before we try. The author of the article gives many examples after every statment. He also gives facts which makes the reads believe what he is saying. For everything he says he has an explanation for.",2,2,0,3,0,1,1,1,0
"In sept . 1997,Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's aircraft captured a photo of a landform in a human shaped face many people belive that the landform could of been created by aliens.

The picture of the face was not created by aliens. On April5,1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the fist time. The Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture ten times better than the Original photo. The picture revealed a natural landform not the face many though really exsisted.

On April 8, 2001 --a cloudless summer day on the planet mars the Global surveypr had a second chance to look at the landform. This time each pixel in the 201 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 23 meters per pixel in the viking photo. you can now see thing better in the photo it shows butte or mesa-landforms witch are comon.

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" The author stated both positive and negative stances on the topic of driverless cars. This topic is very controversial when bringing in the aspect of safety and the well-being of others around the driverless car. And, because of that I believe driverless cars are not a good idea to bring into society.

First, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits.

Second, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive.

Lastly, driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction.

These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good.",4,4,3,3,1,2,1,2,1
"The world of Venus is very rough, and there are lots of hazards we must overcome if we plan on visiting the planet. The whole planet is filled with danger around every corner, and we would need alot of protection if we planed to visit this unknown world. It is a planet very close to Earth, but it is also extremely close to the sun, making it 800 degrees fahrenheit on the planets surface. There is also clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid, and powerfull volcanoes. Which makes the idea of actually stepping foot on the planet impossible.

If we founded research to go near the planet, and studied Venus from a blimp like aircraft it would help us with reseach of how the world looked up close, but we will never be able to actually take samples of the world, no ground samples or gass samples because its too risky. The idea of a aircraft hovering 30 miles above the planet sounds amazing, and makes u imagine what it would be like, but there would not be much progress due to not being able to take pictures of the planet. The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that light does not travel through it making prictures and videos completely inefective. Even after we get there and see the planet, what then the gass would not let us continue to explore the planet, and without any photos or evidence the public might not even beleave that it took place.

Nasa is working on many approaches to study and find ways to reach venus. They have tested the material silicon carbon, in a chamber simulating the conditions we may face on the planets surface. The materials lasted three weeks in the condition, but what if the world of Venus is even worse then the chamber Nasa has built, would humans only have a certain amount of time to study the planet before before there ship and them get dissolved by the planet?

The author is very smart and knows his facts, but he does not know how dangerouse the planet will be, Nasa should focas on Mars and not a planet so hard for us to travel and discover. We have sent rovers to mars and they have landed and some still work to this day, but every thing Nasa has sent to venus has failed, this is why we should choose the red planet.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1

"The main advantages that people seem to find in the less use of cars is that the bad and harmful emissions given off are being reduced. The amount of emissions entering our air daily is beyond belief. In Germany, passenger cars are guilty for 12 percent of the emissions; while here in America we give off 57 percent. Germany has made the change to allow you to have a car if it is parked in a city garage not near the living quarters, or you can pay $40,000 to have your own ""large"" garage. All malls, stores and parks are just within a walking distance. With the decrease in the number of cars, the access of public transportation has rose. Paris has recently joined this trend. Days after the record amount of pollution in the air clean air was just a must for these people. the next day you were ordered to leave your cars in the garage or you would be fined a fine of 22 euros($31 dollars).

Within the lack of cars moving around the people, digestion was down 60 percent in as little as 5 days. 27 people wanted to avoid the fine so they had their cars impounded. France blamed the Diesael fuel. Diseal makes up 67 percent of vehicles in France. The goal is to promote alternative transportation. The idea that transportation emissions need to go away has led to this, "" these people are generating a revolutinary change. This change is crossing our borders.""

"The driverless Cars article I am against because What benefits would we get from these cars Will auto body parts run out of buisness because of the cars What will happen to taxi drivers jobs.

What benefits would we get out of these cars? Maybe we will get less wrecks with them but think of this what will happen if your car sensors and autopilot doesn't work anymore the passangers will have to drive but what if they don't know how to drive because the driving classes got taken away because these cars don't need a driver. It also shows in the text that if something bad happens who's fault is it the manufacturer or the driver in this case it would be the manufacturers fault because they didn't check the car throughly and shipped it somwhere to be sold to some people then thoese people get stuck in the middle of nowhere because of the driverless car and the manufacturer but what will happen if the car gets struck by lightning because of all the electrical systems the passangers/car is using will the passangers be unharmed or will there be a tragedy because the manufacturer didn't think ahead.

Will Auto body part shop's run out of buisness since these driverless cars will probably not get in a wreck. Do these manufacturers not know they will be taking people's jobs because of some driverless car that won't need an auto body repair anytime soon. These families with this type of buisness will go hungry because of this job loss but even if they don't lose their jobs buisness will be very slow because like again these cars won't get into an accident because of the sensors all over the car so the companies will still go bankrupt because of the slow buisness and the bills for the building and bills for their own houses, not including from their families,school bills, and bills to buy food and clothes how are they suppose to get that if there buisness is gone the state is gonna have to help them in someway because it is their fault for not making driverless cars illeagal in their state.

What will happen to the people who make money by driving cars? Will the manufacturers care that they are taking some people's only source of income away. They are doing it by taking the drivers out because that brings in a lot of money for the drives like in New York city taxi drivers get a lot of money because of the buisness there if the driverless cars get to New York where are the other people gonna work at. The unemployed rate is gonna increase because of the cars and so is the homeless rate because people are losing money causing them to get kicked out of the place they live because they can't pay their bills anymore they will also be starving because of the lack of money equals the lack of food and homeless shelters will be overwhelmed with the new increase rate of homeless people on the streets now.

So in the en I still disagree with this article Will it give us benefits will it affect autobody part shops and How will it have an affect in the Taxi drivers in New York city. These cars may seem harmless but they will have a huge impact in our society and in our economy.",2,3,0,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Although the idea of driverless cars might sound life-changing, I see very little aspects on how this could positivly affect our world. Therfore, I do not support the idea of driverless cars. Driverless cars would take away jobs. They could possibly also take away ""milestones"" in our lives. It seems to me like this idea came from pure laziness.

Firstly, driverless cars will take away a huge milestone in upcoming generation lives. Remember when you first learned to ride a bike? Now think about the time when you first sat behind a car's steering wheel. This milestone that I am talking about is learning how to drive a car. Future generations will have no need to complete this with the idea of driverless cars. The permit test and drivers test may not exsist in the future with driverless cars around!

Secondly, driverless will be responsible for the disappearance of road police officers. Today, we see these men and women monitoring the road and keeping everyone safe. We will not need them anymore, because of driverless cars, no matter what, driverless cars would most likely obey all speed limits posted. You may be thinking,

""well won't it be a safer environment if driverless cars obey the speed limits?

Yes, you are correct. But what if a glitch occured in this technology generated car, and it decided not to follow it's regular ""code."" This would be a huge issue on the manufacture's part.

Lastly, the idea of driverless cars put into action frightens me. Think of how lazy we would all become. Technology is already immensely over-taking our world, and driverless cars are solving not one issue. Yes, being chauffered around could be relaxing once in awhile. But what happened to earning the things you worked for? To me, driverless cars are the start of us, humans, being handed everything on a silver platter.

In conclusion, I do not support the idea of driverless cars. Why not? Driverless cars will take away milestones, they will take away jobs, and they will make us lazy. What's next? No need to walk around anymore? Will we have everything at the push of a button? Who knows, it is up to us to start voicing our opinions to decide what happens with these ideas.",3,4,2,3,1,2,2,2,3
"The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Information from Nasa has led us to conclude that it was created by natural causes.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered, the picture seen was captioned, ""huge rock formation."" The discription then goes into detail about how shadows gave an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The public made up their own minds on how this Face had formed. The ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon and was present in many films, books, and even radio stations.

The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase.

Pictures were later taken to confirm that there is no alien monument on Mars. The picture actually showed a Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, landforms which are common on Earth.

Based on thorough evidence and research, NASA has come to conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform.",1,4,1,3,2,2,2,2,3
"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""

ESSAY

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article about the planet Venus.The article talks about features that Venus has and how dangerous it could be to humans to explore. The author of the article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers that could happen. Why does the author support that idea?

Why does the author support the idea of exploring Venus even with all the dangers that come when exploring it.The author does not say

that exploring venus would be a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers that could come, but he shows in the article facts that prove that he supports the idea.For example in paragraph number seven he states , ""

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made silicon carbide have been tested in a

chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""This shows that he belives that there will be an exploraion on planet Venus.

The Author of "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" belives that exploring venus is possible in the future.Technology is getting more advance everyday,He stated in the text with facts that he is right in what he belives.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many reasons why I think that the face on Mars just a natral land formation. One reason is that where the face is formed there are ofther Martian mesa. That is what made the land look like a face and the shadowing was just right and it makes the eyes, nose and mouth.

My second argument is this. After the MGS had taken the first photo of the face they still needed better pictures. So there was a picture taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the origonal picture. Revealeing that the face is a natural landform. There is no connection of aliens to the face. People still did not want to belive it isn't a real face. This brings me to my final argument about the Mars face.

My last argument is proof. The MGS got close enough to take a second picture. This time the team used the camaras absolute maximum resolution. Which means that you can see pretty much anything that would be around the face. Things like airplains on the ground, shacks, buildings, pyramids, etc. What the picture actully showed was that the face is a landformation. It showed that the face was an equivalent of a butte or mesa. These are a few reasons why I think that the Mars face is just a landformation.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,2,1
"The Seagoing Cowboys program was very adventurous because of all the fun you can have along the way. When you become a Seagoing Cowboy, you have many opportunities to have fun, such as sight seeing, meeting new people in other countries, and at the end of the journey the holds where the animals were is opened up for many games everyone can play! The Seagoing Cowboys program was an adventure I'll never forget and I hope you'll become a Seagoing Cowboy yourself.

One of the reasons why the Seagoing Cowboys program is so adventurous was because of all the sight seeing. During my time as a Seagoing Cowboy, I went to many places all over the globe, including Greece, Italy, China, the Panama Canal, and many other places. Some places I went to were the trips of a life time. One of my favorite trips was the Acropolis in Greece. It was special to see and I cherished the opportunity. By becoming a Seagoing Cowboy yourself, you can make your own memories in the world.

Another reason why the Seagoing Cowboys program is so adventurous is the chance to help people in other countries. I helped a ton full of people as a Seagoing Cowboy and their smiles warmed my heart. By giving people the cattle they need, it ended up helping not only them, but me too. I'm greatful for the opportunity, it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Because of that awareness, my family ended up hosting many international students and exchange visitors for many years. You too can help many people in other countries and help them. By doing this, the world can become a greater place.

The final reason why the Seagoing Cowboys program is so adventurous is that the end of the journey and during the return, people can have a chance to loosen up a bit and play some games. When all of the cattle are in other countries, the places where they were stored become opened up and you're allowed to play games. Some coyboys enjoy playing baseball and volleyball games, while others like having Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and other games. All of these games allow a cowboy to spend the rest of the way back having fun and if a cowboy doesn't want to play games, he can stay in his room and enjoy some quiet. You too can become a Seagoing Cowboy and have the experience of a lifetime.

As you can see, the Seagoing Cowboys program is the chance of a lifetime and a dream come true. By becoming a cowboy, you can make your own adventures and add a little spice to your life. Sight seeing, Meeting new people, and games are just the tip of the iceberg when you're a Seagoing Cowboy. Become a Seagoing Cowboy and you won't regret it. I hope you become a cowboy and have the adventure of a lifetime.",3,4,3,4,3,2,3,3,4
"Have you ever wondered about the Face on Mars? You probably told yourself it wasn't real, or you're one of those people who have done their research and love the idea of it being real. Well, I'm here today to tell you how it's not created by aliens. Aliens don't exist to our knowledge yet, so therefore we cannot assume that it was made by them.

First, as we refer back to the 2001 picture, it looks cracked and it looks like it was covered. In the 1998 picture, it looked like it was somewhat burning. In the 1976 Viking 1 picture towards the middle of the article, it shows the shadows, making it look like a human face. The eye was caused because of a hole, so it was dark. The nose was caused by the shadow on the right half of the face.

Then, NASA knew it was going to get popular very fast, and it did. It was a pop icon all over the world. For example, ""It had starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" (5). That goes to show NASA was in it for more fame, because who doesn't want to see a face on Mars?

Finally, it's just a natural landform! As the article states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image appeared first on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform"" (7). You shouldn't always believe what you hear. It wasn't (an) alien(s) who made it. It was a natural landform with a few shadows on it, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less.

The Face on Mars wasn't made by aliens. The pictures show it. NASA also just wanted to get popular off of it, because they know how us people are. We'd die to believe anything is true. It's also just a natural landform. Why would you believe what other people say? Why would you let others make you believe soemthing, why don't you just believe what you want to?",3,3,3,3,2,2,3,2,3
"The face on mars was not made by aliens or anything else. The details from from the old camera made it look like a face because it was blurry. They told people about the face and showed to help make money for Nasa. it was made naturally from volcanoes and other things like sand storms. It would be impossible for aliens to do it from this distance and make it look that much like it from a bad camera.

The detail from the camera made it look that way because we didnt have the best technology back then than we do now. Also, each year we got better technology and it started to make it look less like a face each time. In the story before paragraph one it show pictures of each year they took a pic of it and it slowly became less of a face. Once we got better technology it made stuff much easier for us to see and tell if it was made or it was just a coincidence.

Next, nasa told everyone about there discover and that made a lot of new movies and magizines come out from it. they wanted money so in paragraph five they talk all about it and about how they wanted stuff to happen. People thought they were trying to hide somethings about aliens making the faces as proof. The people wanted know a lot about this and waited for the pictures to come up on a website and many was disappointed.

After, that face is made out of it sand and mostly rock from volcanos when they burst into flames and creates land forms. The wierd shadowing is comeing from all the sand around them and makes slight shadowing on the face to make it look like a face. it took many years for them to find something like this and then they realized it was just a landform. The only way for smoething like that to happen is by luck not aliens because aliens didnt do anything here or on mars. the sun was a big helper in making the face because nothing could cause that shadowing to happen on mars.

I know that some people beleive that aliens are real and some people don't beleive in aliens. I kind of get why people think that in the first place because what possibly can creat such huge thing that looks like an humans face. All you have to do is think about it because it is impossible for there to be aliens around us. We are to far away from other life to be found by aliens; there are trillions of trillions of stars with more planets by them. The possability of them finding us so fast is merely unbelievably impossible in my opinion. So aliens did not make the pyramids on earth and they did not make the face on mars .

Lastly, the face on mars did not get created by aliens; it was created by nature. The only reason we thought we saw a face is because of the old camera that couldn't see it without blurring stuff out. the main reason they told people about the face is just to make some money for nasa in the first place. The face is not made out of metal or some alien material because all it is made out of is rock and the red sand that is on that planet. That is why aliens didn't make it because they couldn't of because they aren't real.",3,4,0,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Why should we study Venus? What would we as humans gain from this? These are the questions that the author leaves unanswered and doesn't support. The author does an excellent job describing how we can go to Venus, but he only provides two reasons as to why we should explore Venus, and also poorly explains those reasons.

His first reason is that Venus might ""have been the most Earth-like planet."" While this is a good reason to explore the planet the author fails to elaborate why this should make people want to explore Venus. He could've said something along the lines that learning how Venus went from an Earth resembling planet to the unhabitable planet it is now could help us take care of own planet. The author does not make any attempt to show why this factor would make humans want to explore Venus, instead he just explains how similar the plabets resemble each other. And none of this could even be true because it is not known for sure that Venus once was the most Earth-like planet. The author even says that it might have been, not that it was, but that it might have been.

The second reason the author uses to support his claim is because humans have a ""curiosity"" that ""will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endavors."" Much like his first reason this is a great one but he also fails to accurately explain this reason much like the first one. Humans do have a curiosity which makes us want to explore things but why should this allow us to ignore all the dangers that come with it? Paragraphs before the author gives this reason he tells about all the dangers that Venus has, he says ""that the atmosphere is almost 97 percent CO2"", that ""temperatures average 800 degrees Fahrenheit . and that atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" After lisiting all the dangers Venus has he then says we should becuase human curiosity makes us explore things, but he says that after giving all the reasons why Venus is dangerous. Sure the author gives great examples as to how people could explore Venus like with a blimp and how they could make exploring Venus easier, but just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. Exploring Venus and new technology wouls cost a lot of time and money. Maybe the author could've said that Venus's natural resources would make a lot of money. That would be a great way to support pursuing Venus because people would do a lot for money.

The author has a very reasonable claim about how humans should explore Venus, but he poorly explains it. The author's two main reasons could've been very convincing if he had thoroughly explained them and shown that Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers. The author makes readers think the other way because he also gives many dangers Venus has, and this would make people not want to pursuit studying Venus. The author does a great job explaining how we can explore Venus, but a terrible one explaining why we should explore Venus.",4,4,3,3,1,3,3,3,2
"A new source of technology haas been invented that has the power to enable computers to indentify human emotions. This is called the Facial Action Coding System. The first step of the computer is to construct a 3-D computer model of the persons face. This includes all 44 muscles on a human's face as well. They must move exactly as if they were human muscles for the experiment to work. Six emotions have been classified by the model that are the most common expressions of a person in their daily life. These would be happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are all also associated with each and every movement of the facial muscles. The new created technology seems to be valuable to the people that use it today and specifically would have a value for students in a classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track facial movements with the new emotion-recognition software created in the system. It weighs every unit and can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared to a face that show no emotion also clled a neutral face. Dr Huang commented in the artile ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" that he believes "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". This could be a great use to teachers in their classrooms so they know what to explain more on and for which student. As a student, I can assure anyone that the worst thing at school in a class is when you can't understand something. When a student is completely confused, they can loose intrest and also motivation to comprhend what's going in in class. Dr Huang also added that ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"".

This new technology comes with many benifits and advatages for all people of different ages. The Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students and teachers at school during the day. It will help kids be more proactive and motivated in class knowing that if they don't undertsnad something that help from this system will always be there. It's intresting to see all the new inventions and ideas that continue to be created as years go by to benefit human life and the rest of the world. This is an idea that people need to take advatage of and use at school. For this system to be able to read the expressions of sudents in class will communicate to teachers that a student is in need of more attention than others. The help of the Facial Action Coding System could possibly change the life a kid in class and help shape him into a successful hard worker of today's society.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear Florida senator,

I am writing to you today to address what everyone is talking about which is in fact the Electoral College. It has been that topic widely talked about so i decided to research what it actually means and why it causes contreversy. People have viewed the Electoral College as an anachronism and they argue it should be overruled by popular vote but it is a very strong way to select electors and it wouldn't be in use at the moment if it wasn't the right way. According to Bradford Plumer, the single best argument against the Electoral College is what is known as the disaster factor. After reading ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, it provided me with information like how it was established by the founding fathers in the Constitution. The founding fathers are very respected individuals mainly because they were of very great intelligence, so that proves how they came up with something professional.

Though it may seem that the abundance of people are in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States, there are people like I who believe and wish for the best like how keeping the Electoral College is the way to go. In 2000, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote happened but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. I agree with Richard A. Posner that it avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast, I am not the only one who agrees because the facts also prove him right. With being a senator or anyone in office comes alot of pressure, Yet luckily with the Electoral College comes reduction of that pressure. It provides a clear winner when there are times of crisis like for example a run-off election.

The states with a larger capacity (the large states) receive more electoral votes , that is why people argue that it may seem unfair that some states get more participation in the election than others but it is actually very fair since there is more people in that state. I personally believe that the people who argue about the votes are those in the smaller states who feel they dont get the right to vote, it may look unfair but if all states got the same amount of electoral votes given than not everyone in the larger states would get a saying. Also, that is not mentioning the Swing States which are the ones who focus on the ""toss-up"" states. With that pressure the toss-up states are more likely to pay attention the campaign and are the most thoughtful voters and that just proves they deserve to get a majority of votes given.

Considering it may look like changing the election to popular vote may be the right option because it has many small reasons, it is better to have 5 strong reasons than a million unimportant ones to keep something very important. So I congratulate you and the people in office for keeping an open mind of what ""we the people"" have to say but also for knowing that what is in place now is right and should stay this way.",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,0,0
"Have you ever read the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus""?

The author does a good job supporting the idea the studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents in the article.

In paragraph four, the author states that, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" (par. 4) the author then explains that the planet was probably covere in Earth-like features such as oceans. This could give us insight on what happened to Venus to change it into the toxic and empty wasteland that it has become and how something similar could happen on Earth, if we choose to explore the planet.

throughout paragraphs five through seven, the author explains methods and tools we could use to better study the planet. the author mentions NASA's idea for sending humans to study the surface of the planet. ' A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" (par. 5) and the use of mechanical computers in paragraph seven, ""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested i a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" (par. 7) "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."" (par. 7) Mechanical computers use gears and levers to make calculations instead of using electronics, maiking them more resistant th the pressure, heat and other forces of Venus's Surface

In the concluding paragraph, the author gives a couple of reasons and benefits of studying Venus, "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Benus has balue, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" (par. 8) this means that we can not only learn about Venus itself but also prepare us for the problems that may be presented by either other planets, or even our own in the future.

In conclusion, the author does a good job supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author does a good job because the give reasons to study the planet, examples on how we can study the planet, and an explanation on why astronomers want to study Venus.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" explans how there is a new type of technoligy that uses a coumputer system that lets people detect peoples emotions. To get the caculated expressions of someones human emotion the computer system uses a 3D model scan of the persons face then uses mats to detect the presons facal muscles then depending on the position they are will depend on there emotion.

I think in a classroom or school situation this form of a computer system shouldent be used for schools for a number of reasons. In the artical the University says the softare couldent run on home computers and mostly all schools dont have amped up computers thet are bulit to run things like this. So if schools want to start using things like this they would need to get the money for the computers and the software if the founders of it are gonna put a price on it. Another reason is why would schools need such a system like this when they could just do this type of thing on paper with simple question to answer to see the students emotion in class. Or the school could send papers home to the parentes asking how the student is doing home and if the school should be worried about anything for the kids safety. Befor papagraph 8 the artical does give a pretty reason to use this type of system. They show the steps of how to smile or what it does to get the right type of smile to read the emotion of happiness. In the 8th paragraph it shows that in a real smile the muscles called the ""prbicuarlis oculi pars palpabraeus"" make the crow's-feet around your eyes. But when someone does a fake smile the mouth

is stretches sideways using the ""zygomatic major"" and a different muscle, the ""risorius"". So when people smile they can be decteced if they are faking it or not. But in paragraph 9 ""according to the Facal Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresse emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So both paragraph 8 and 9 shows that there is a flaw in this computer system because if someone has never had a ""real smile"" and always used a ""fake smile"" the system will detect no happiness but the oppisite or something else. And thet person will always live with a ""fake smile"" and never a ""real smile"" beacuse the fake one will develop as a real smile if the person keeps doing it because of the facial muscles getting use to it.

So in conclusion I dont think this technology that can read emotional expressions should be used because there are better ways of finding out a kids emotion. And becasue of the big flaw within the system, that being the human body actualy going aganst the facal scan by getting use to express a certan expression that reads differntly on the computer.",3,3,3,2,0,1,1,3,1
"The author supports his idea by adding tons of pro-Venus exploration details throughout the passage. Multiple reasons where given such as comparing Venus to Earth, looking back at the two planets history, and also shared natural events. All are things that push us to keep observing Venus even with difficult conditions.

In the fourth paragraph of the article, the author talks about how Venus may have once been covered in majestic oceans, and most likely able to support numerous forms of life. The author uses this to explain why astronomers are so intrigued by Venus. Even if Venus is inhospitable right now NASA would still like to explore the surface grab samples and bring them back to be tested.

Paragraph two elaborates mostly on comparing the planets Stating, ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" Venus is the closest planent to Earth in terms of density and size."" Connections and inferences can be made from this statement on how Earth and Venus might be similar. While in the 8th paragraph the author claims, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. Meaning technology should grow enough to keep us hungry for exploring Venus.

In conclusion The author wants us to keep trying to explore venus no matter the dangerous obstacle. He shows this by adding plenty of positive and interesting facts about the relationship between Earth and Venus.",2,3,2,2,1,2,2,1,2
"The ""face"" on Mars was first found it was in 1976, at first it was said that the face was made from an alien or aliens once there. NASA belives it was just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" NASA finaly unveiled the image for everyone to see a dew days later, thinking it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars. It certainly did.

Although few scienctist believed the face was an alien artifact, photagraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Blobal Suveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in Spet. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended. ""We felt this was important to taxpayers,"" explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. ""We photographed the face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

On April 5, 1998 Mars Gobal Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera tea, snapped a picture ten ties sharoer than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxiuos web surfers were waiting when a the image first apeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year in the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" says Garvin. ""In fact it's hard work."" On April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia MGS drew close enough for a second look. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptain-style pyramids or even smaller shacks, you could see what they were!"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

From the informtion given here it's proven that the ""Face on Mars"" was not created or signs of an alien or aliens on Mars. The ""face"" was just a natural landform just like here in Earth.",1,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,0
"In addition to, the story people think that the Face was created by aliens. In this essay i will be talking about, Whether or not people have proof or evidence that the Face was created by aliens?, What would make people think that the Face was created by aliens?, and How do you think this if you just found out about the Face?.

With that being said, Do you think these people that thought the Face was created by aliens have proof or any type of evidence?... I don't think they had proof or any type of evidence because it was on Mars people csn not go around assuming that it was created by aliens if they have no proof. People would have to go to Mars and see for theirselves. Just because it was founded on Mars doesn't neccesarly means that it was created by aliens.

Next, What makes people think that the Face was created by aliens?. Is it because they knew that it came from Mars?... I strongly believe it is because all these people knew that it came from Mars, i'll tell you why i think this. I think this because it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stores as stated in paragraph 5. So, because it appeared in so many places people started to make assumtions, and really believed that the Face was created and made by aliens.

Futhermore, How does people think this if they just recently found out about the Face?. Well, people think this just because it it was the most popular story or myth going on at the time and since it came from Mars that it was created by aliens because they know people doesn't live on Mars.. But, that doesn't mean human beings do not visit to see what it is like in person.

In my opinion, last but not least, people should not make any assumtions before they don't know the full story or the truth behind it all and to ask people who was it created it by and stop always thinking they know everything and making a lot of assuming statements, to where it makes a huge rumor around the world.",3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"What would you think about driverless cars driving around your neighborhood? I would totally disagree and be against of these cars. I wouldn't accept it at all because of these three reasons: It will be a big risk of our lives, we can't trust in technology on everything, and it would cost a lot of money. You are probably thinking ""How can it be dangerous, useless, and expensive?"". Well let me explain it to you why.

The first reason: it would be a big risk for all our lives. Why? Well, it can really be dangerous. For example if you are driving in a highway with your children the car might malfunction and get in an accident and damage or probably worse kill your children. It could happen, like another example what if you are driving in your driverless car and out of no where your car stops and the car behind you malfuntions and crashes into you, you could be severly damage anything could happen like that. We have to know what we are getting into before we all try it because it can save our lives.

Another reason: we can't trust on technology on everything. Like I said driving can be very dangerous and letting our lives in technology's hands can be a big risk. We can't trust them on everything, sure it's really cool thinking ""Hey we can have driverless cars"" but no it can be very dangerous. For example what if we need to go somewhere and we trust that the car can take us to our destination, but we realize later the car took us to the wrong turn now we are heading the wrong direction. It is better for us to drive our own with us humans controlling the vehicle.

Final reason: it can be very expensive. What is one thing that is a big pain in all of us in our lives? Money. Money is difficult for all of us, it basically controls us. The one thing we all know that the car will be really expensive and it will be hard to buy one. People will want to buy because it looks cool or it will really help them in their lives. I think they are a waste of time, we are perfectly fine with normal cars that take us wherever we need to go and that's it we don't need expensive cars. This car isn't a need but only a want for everyone.

So in my opinion I think driverless cars are a dangerous, useless, and expensive. Dangerous because it is a big risk in our lives. Useless because we can't always trust on technology about everything even if it involves our lives. Lastly, it will be too expensive and it will not be a need for everyone. So in your opinion what do you think of driverless cars?",2,4,2,3,0,1,1,1,1
"In this essay its all about Venus and how hot it is and what it would be like to live there and what it would take to live there. So im going to start off by saying in my opion that it would not be fun to live there because of how hot it is. Despite the dangers in this artical it explains how hard it would to be there becuase of the sutdys of how the scients.

Even tho that it looks like a cute little star from where we see it on planet earth. This planet can reach the tempature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit thats pretty

hot if you think about it. It takes up to about 350 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit it make an average pizza at home now think of that twice as hot. Because thats the only the average tempeture on the planet. And did you know that Venus is the clostest planet to u. Its also the next planet we go to for us to live on if we ever get that far in science. in my opionn

i think that we will eventually get there now i dont know how long it will take us but i firmly belive that we we will get there. Venus is also known as earth twin. Because of terms of density and size. But we can't forget about our nerighbor by the name of ""Mars"". but the weird thing is that we all orbit the sun at differnt speeds. some cool things is that we have sent mulitple things to venus called ""space crafts"" but the sad thing is that non of the space crafts have lasted any longer than a acoulpe hors on venus. That is why we have not done any unmanned missions.

The planet venus has almsot 97 perdcent carbon dioxide blankets. a couple rason why i dont think that we could live there right now is because. the atmsopheric pressure is 90 percent more higher than the earths is!!! So this means that the things on planet venus are way more extreme than anything we have ever encounterd here on earth. Back to what i was saying with the tempature it is has the hottest surface in our solar system. A fun fact about venus is that it use to be fully covered in water which is kinda weird if you think about it because its the hottest surfaace a plantet surface has.

What im trying to say is that Venus would be so cool to live on but would also be really akward to live on because of how hot it is we would prolly have to wear hot suits to stay alive but i dont think ill be alive by the time we get thre because we cant even send machines there for a couple hours without them breaking so hopefully in the future we will be able to because it would be such an expirence for someone to live there and just be able to feel what its like to live on another planet.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the article, the author does present a lot of postitives and negative aspects of driverless cars. In my opinion, i am for the development of these cars. technology keeps growing and spreading wider each day. In the article it says how these cars are already on the way of being developed, Goolgle has had cars that could drive indepedently, but only under certain conditions. Googles cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash, so you know that the ""Driverless Cars"" will be safe.

I personally think that these cars would benifit people and the world in many ways. Gooogle cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars he foresees would use half of the fuel of todays taxis and that it could offer way more flexibility then a bus, these cars would fundamentally change the world. Plus driving would be at at a way lower risk of car accidents, because it is a smart computer telling the car what to do. The ""driverless cars"" have already made alot of progress and alt of diffrent companies are trying to make these, as safe and as fast as possible.

The company BMW announced the develpoment of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013. The car can Brake, steer, and accelerate all by themselves. The person in the car has to have his or her hands on the wheel at all times because they are not made completly driverless yet, but they are getting more advanced every year, and i believe that someday driverless things will be a thing, and i hope it is. More lives will be safe. Less gas will be used so its better for our enviroment. If people are angry or have had to much to drink they can get home safley and with out an accident.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Dear state senator I think that you should keep the Electoral Collage because it is a collage that requires a presidential canidate to have a trans-regional appeal. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recivies a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College is a method of choosing the president of the United States and that is really importnt that we have a president. The Founding Fathers established the Electoral College because it's in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral Collage is very important to the United States we should keep the collage. In some cases people depend on the Electoral collage they chose who will be President and like state goveners that is very impornant that the founding fathers made the Electoral Collage. In 1976,  tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had votes he other way. The election is only a few swing voters away from catastrophe.",1,3,1,1,0,0,1,0,0
"Although many people believe that the photo of a "" Human Face"" taken by NASA's Viking 1 from 1976 is created by aliens , many scientists prove it to be wrong. Considering how land can form in many shapes and sizes , it's not impossible for a landmass to looklike a face. It's also not impossible for aliens to build it but the fact that NASA have never discovered aliens prove that it cannot be credit to aliens, atleast not yet. Light also made it looklike a face and hide some parts with shadows thus making us blind to the other half. Another prove is that if we view it closer, it's nothing like a face but just an illusion. Therefore proving that aliens should not be credit of creating it.

Landmasses can have a variety of results. On Earth there are many landmasses ranging from high mountains to blue seas to dry lands and each of them have different types of appeareance. There are also many islands on Earth that shaped like a heart or other shapes. Even on Earth, there are many artifacts that are thought to be made by aliens. Why? Because they were ahead of their time but as soon as humen start accepting them, they were considered inventions. Knowing this fact, it's pretty clear that there will be more unique shapes and unknown tools to be discover on the Red Planet. We just have to take our time and use it as our advantage.

Light also tricked our brains into believing that it was a face. Light can cause many illusions and it's strongest with shadows. We humen use light to make shadows of dogs and rabbits using our hands and the result seems like a dog's or rabbit's shadow. The shadows hide the other half of the face and thus the other half might just be a plain of nothing on it. We only use our naked eyes to judge it when we should use the measurements to determine if it really could be a face or just a landmass.

Then in 2001, NASA took another picture of the ""Human Face"" and with better and higher technologies, the face was re-discovered with small details. The camara from 1976 did not provide enough evidences and it's not clear enough for our naked eyes to see the small details like the strings and the land features. The land features prove that the other half was nothing like what we imagined. Only half is like a face and the other half is just land with no features of a human face. The picture from 2001 reveals that, what was thought to be a face made by aliens for decades, is just illusion made by landmass and light.

Many people still and will still believe that it was made by aliens because they are in denial. Although aliens existing has always made humen curious about the lifeform of other planets, the face is just leading us into a wrong direction. We need to focus more on discovering more planets beyond our reach and also see if there is water source available on them. We should not let little landmass trick us into wasting millions and millions of dollars on it. But what ever the cause may be, nature will always surprise us and we just have to be ready for it.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"Venus is Earth's sister planet. But along with being our sister planet, Venus has the highest recorded temperature of any planet in our solar system. Along with having the highest temperature recorded, Venus also has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also coat Venus's atmosphere, making it difficult to even make it through the outer layers of Venus's atmosphere. So why would Earth's scientists still want to vist Venus?

According to the article, Venus is the planet that is most similar to Earth, well at least it used to be. The author tells the reader about how Venus was probably covered in oceans that could have supported life, similar to Earth. The planet also has many other land forms that are similar to the ones we have here on Earth, such as, valleys, rocks, and craters. The author proceeds to say that ""the value of returning to Venus is indisputable."" Although there are many dangers of sending vessels back to Venus, the author states that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, otherwise known as NASA, is working on ways to send astronauts to Venus. The author also tells the reader that solar power on Venus would be abundant, and that radiation levels would be similar to those on Earth. He goes on to say that the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, not an ideal temperature for astronauts traveling to Venus, but it is survivable.

While traveling to Venus may take Earths scientists years to figure out, and be very costly, the information we could learn would be invaluable. Although Earth's scientists may be faced with many problems while trying to get astronauts to Venus, from the information provided in the article you could infer that he strongly believes that it is possible, and not only believes that we could travel to Venus but encourages it.",2,3,3,3,2,3,2,1,3
"Have you ever thought about being able to read how someone feels even if they show no emotion ? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile""by Nick D'Alto, new technology is being described. Many examples are given on why the new technology is helpful.The use of technology to read the emotional expressions is valuable because it helps out students,and stops the problem of having to wonder about someones emotions.

The use of technology to read emotional expressions is valuable because it helps students.

In the article it stated, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" it also states,"" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". Having a computer being able to tell that a student is bored or confused allows the computer to change those emotional facial expressions so that the students enjoy learning and able to learn better.The computer may not be a human instructor but it would be able to help like a human instructor.

Not only does

the use of technology to read emotional help out students,it also stops the problem of having to wonder about someones emotions. In the article it stated, ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trtait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" it also states, ""yet...studied human anatomy to help them pain facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"". Those examples show that because we have this new technolgy to allow us to read the emotional expressions,its not easier to be exact on how someone is feeling without hsving to guess.

"I think the FACS is a pretty clever project. It's mostly accurate and was made with real studies and facts from human facial expression. I think the FACS is a very intresting concept but I do not place it as valuable.

For one, the FACS can't be accurate all the time. Humans are complicated and it's often very hard to tell how they're feeling. Most people like to ""fake"" their emotions. They're smiling but they're actually feeling awkwardly uncomfterble or angrly calm. It can be easy to trick the system, many can fake a genuine smile and confuse the system into thinking wrong.

Another reason is that the FACS doesn't provide any real benefits to anyone. Sure it can be a little fun to test out different emotions to see different ratings but it dosen't actually provide any information that can be very useful later on in life. People have different faces for different emotions, none are the exact same. Similar yes, but it varies and mistaking an emotion for something else may bother said person.

In conclusion, the FACS can be accurate but holds no value to society. It can be good fun, goofing around with freinds when boredum hits you but it's nothing else. It's a one time game that'll get boring quickly and thrown away for the next big project.",2,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"People are arguing about keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. People saying its a bad idea for keeping the electoral college and they want the popular voting for the president. The passage ""Does The Electoral College Work?"" is about keeping the electoral college or changing the system by popular voting. Its showing the negatives and postives about the two agreements. My two sources shows why not to keep the electoral colleges. ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer is about wrongs about electoral colleges such as the winner-take-all method and more. ""Source 3: In Defense Of The Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner is about how Electoral Colleges votes are good and how its hard to use electoral votes by citizens. Im against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless.

Im aganist Electoral Colleges because its unfair. Its unfair because your not voting for the president, your voting for a slate of electors and thats not fair at all. Its not guranteed that the person you wanted to become president will be president. The quote i have shows how electoral colleges are unfair. this quote states that ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races inthe ""swing"" states."" The candidates does not know the states because they havent been there for awhile to understand the states problems. They cannot fix it if the candidates doesn't know. Electoral college is outdated and irrational to the voters and not fair towards them either. This other quote I have can show how electoral colleges are unfair also. This quote states that ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor."" The disaster factor is that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors, and that those electors always defy the will of the people. The system contain worse for the people and its truley unfair.

Im against Electoral colleges because its worthless. Its worthless because the electoral college dosen""t care about the people. Its lacking on everything in the system such as responsiblities and fairness. This quote states that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral college despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons."" This shows that the electoral college is lacking in things concerning the system to the electors and president. Its worthless to the voters if its not helpful. My other quote that shows how its worthless is that ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrrying their state."" Democrats in Texas are one of the reasons about Electoral Colleges. Their votes will will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attentionto the campaign.

Im against Electoral Colleges because its unfair and worthless. Its unfair to the voters and worthless if its not involve with the voters too. People can like the Electoral Colleges, but I think its not good for the United States of America.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"A wide range of people make conspiracy theories based off of tv and maagazines. Most of their theories are false due to lack of research.

"In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Chordless phones are more of an antique than a necessity. People no longer write letters, but rather send a quick email or text. Cars are becoming, and will continue to become, more and more updated as the years progress. As handy as it is to have a car with bluetooth and heated seats, is it a benefit to the lives of 2016 to have a car with no driver? Due to all the challenges the government will face and many of technical difficulties this world faces today, the obvious answer is no.

It is always nice to be able to do less. Sitting back and relaxing is something everyone enjoys. However, when a woman gets into a taxi and imputs her destination, she is entrusting her life in technology. Teenagers like the thrill of roller coasters, until one gets stuck at the peak of the ride. This woman liked the car until the steering wheel got stuck, sending her into a ditch. She liked it before the brakes stopped working because of a wire snapping. Many things could go wrong technilogically, that would make the car ride seem a little bit scary. ""If the technology fails..."" (paragraph 9). Even the author of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" didn't deny that many things could in fact go wrong technilogically.

Even if this woman did get to her destination safely, many factors had to take roll in making driverless cars possible. For starters, the law would have to be set. ""New laws will be needed in order to cover liability in case of an accident."" (paragraph 9). It takes 75% of congress to be able to take a law to the president. When it makes its way there, the president can still deny that law; furthermore, it has to go back to the congress and get revoted. Laws put in this position do not normally pass.

""In most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" (paragraph 9). It would take many months or even years to be able to pass this law, considering they have all this information about driverless cars and only a few places are allowed to even test them. Questions are raised such as ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" (paragraph 9). Too much time is put into trying to pass the law, and in a society that is looking for ways to save time, it isn't worth the effort.

Furthermore, America has other problems to fix. The government does not need to put this country into more debt by spending its time and money on cars that are even less safe for its citizens. When smarter roads became too high of costs to be practical, people turned to developing smarter cars. ""In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track....something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" (Paragraph 3). For 76 years people have been putting time, money, and energy into making these cars more practical. Cars aren't a neccessity to everyone. Certain religions (such as the Amish) are without cars. Mackinac Island runs by horse and buggy. True, that isn't efficient for this huge country, but being billions of dollars in debt, that time and money could be used to help America pay what it owes. In the mean time, Americans can put up with what they have been using for many years.

In the generation of 2016, many things are updated. Phones don't have chords anymore. Americans don't send letters by mail as much as they used to. The citizens of this countru have been very efficient on many things. They have learned how to save time and money; furthermor, they have encorperated those ideas into everyday life. However, one item America doesn't need, due to limited safety; the time it takes for laws to pass; and the debt this country is in, is driverless cars.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Driveless cars shouldn't be countinued because they are dangerous, cost more, and only go to 25 mph.

Secondly, they are way too expenisve.(paragraph 3.)These smart - road systems worked suprisingly well, but they require massive upgrades to exsiting roads, something that was simply too expenisive to be practical.

"This new technology to read emotional expressions is stupid. I am against this machine for there is no value to, possibly inacurate, and what is there to learn from.?

The first reason why I am against it is that I don't see any value in it. Why would people want to know what there emotional expression is when they are the ones who are doing the expression. The other person might want to know but at the same time maybe they're okay with what they are seeing from the other person than finding out what is behind it that expression. To me that's like invading my personal emotions, and then when they find out it means something else they might be mad or asking questions why.

The next reason is, that there might be a possibility that the machine is incorrect. For example, when the person is acting like he/she is mad but messing around, but the machine might take it serious and the person who doesn't know if he/she is actually mad will think that is and start asking questions why are they mad at them and then it create an argument between them. There also could be a malfunction in the system and when the person is actually happy the machine might take it as a sad and fearful expression and that will raise some questions.

The last reason why I am against it is what is there to learn from the machine? The only thing I see it as a helping thing is when it comes to court and therapy setions. The only thing I can see it as is a machine that causes violence and arguments. There is absolutely nothing else you can learn from it and to me its useless.

These are the reasons why I'm against this emotional expression machine. They are: there is no value to it, possibility of inarcuracy, and nothing to learn from it.",2,3,2,3,0,1,0,1,1
"Do You Know What The Electoral College Is?

The electoral college is not a place in united states. It is a process that the founing fathers made a long time ago. When they where first making the congress. It is a election of the presient by popular vote of the people in the united states.

The Electoral college is a process. That consists of people that are in congress that help vote for the Presient and Vice President.

The Electoral college consists of 538 elector, But there must be a majority of the 270 electoral votes to elect the next President. Your state's entitle allotment of electors equal to the members in the congress at a time. There most be one house of representetives plus there most be two senators in each states. In congress to make the vote go though.

Under the 23rd Amendment of the constitution, the District of Columbia is allocate  3 electors. They are treated like they are a state that is in the united states, But most people just call them District of columbia.

Each state has a candidate that running for president in there state. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but there a lot of states that are not like that and the vote on who they believe in. Who they think that is going to do the best job as president.

The president election is held every four years. no president can be president more then twice, but there was one person had more then two but that was a thing that happend because there was a war going on.

The presiential election is held every four years on the first tuesday after the first monday on November. you help choose the next president of the united state. but only if you are 18 you can not vote before you are 18.

Most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards alll electors to the winning presient candidate. However, maine and nedraska each have a variation of

"" proportional representation. ""

After the president election, your governor prepares a ""certificate of ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for president in your along with the names of their respective electors. the certificate of ascertianment also declares the winner of the president election that in there state at the meeting of the electors in december of the election year. your state's certificates of ascertainments are sent to the congress an the national archives as a part of the official records of the presiential election.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The claim that the author supports the idea that studing Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers because they maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. The dangers and pursuit are higly high risks for people and NASA.It is dangers because Venus is the secound planet from our sun and the atmosphere in Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging is that the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the plant surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. The despite to go Venus is that they are hoping to look for something their because the plant has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. Somethings that we some how have they call Venus Earths sister. That why I think it so despite that NASA wants to see what else Venus got that the plants sister does not have.

An explanation of the article that supports my claims are when the author says this ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Also when they said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""Venus is also dangers for people because it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""Beyond high pressure and heat,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

My conclusion to the authors writting is that they will not end up sending people to Venus because its to risky. They will end up sending newer technoligi up their so that they could see what the sister of Earth got. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth -like planet in our solar system. Venus is most likely the most compared planet to Earth. Is to dangers for people because its the secound planet hottest then the Sun.",0,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Dear senator,

I think that the presidential election should be settled by popular vote.  We people are being run as a country by the president, and we should be able to have more of an impact choosing who our president will be.

The president currently gets chosen in the Electoral College, a process in which the electors vote for President and Vice President after they are selected.  This process flows very well and the president is chosen easily, so its good.  The Electoral Collage consists of 538 electors.  The majority being 270 electoral votes and the first president to get to this number in the race wins.  We the people are separated into states and the states get however many electoral votes based on population.  So the bigger states get more say on who's President, but I mean that makes sence because more citizens live there.  There are also many flaws with this process though, and thats why I think it should be settled by popular vote.

You may think that the people are mainly voting for the President in the Electoral Collage process, but we're not.  The people just vote for electors who in turn elect the President.  Some of the slates of electors may even vote for who they want to and forget about what the majority of the state wants.  At the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-takes-all system in each state.  This means that if say Florida has twenty-nine electoral votes, then all twenty-nine go to the candidate who wins that state.  ""So normaly candidates don't spend time in states they know they have know chance of winning, focusing only on the ""swing states"" and the larger populated states.""  ""Swing states"" are states that pay close attention to the campaign and really listen to the competing cadnidates.  This means that the states may pick the republican or democrat.  Some states pick the same way every election.  During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina.  I mean what kind of madness is that, how are they supposed to know who to choose.  Thats not fair and it shouldn't be settled that way.  This all just proves that ""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""

Therefore the Electoral Collage shouldn't be the way to elect the President and Vice-President and should be either altered or in my opinion scratched.  So then they should be elected by popular vote, so we have more control on who runs the country.

Sincerely,

Luke",3,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,1
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it discusses the possibility of cars that humnas do not have to drive are coming. Driverless cars are not a smart choice for drivers shoud make. There are too many risks of dangerous incidents that could happen that could caused danger to other drivers and the drivers would lose the freedom from driving their own vehicle. Driverless cars are not a smart investiment because it only prolongs the laziness of today's people.

A car was made for there to be human control over it; that is the reason that the ""driverless"" cars that have already been created have not been completely driverless. The car needs that control from a being with feelings and not just a computer. This argument could be the same as the argument over robots; should robots be a common household item? The argument being robots having no feelings and not understnading everything humans do. Say for instance scientist and enginers do create a ""driverless"" car in paragragh 7 it states that, ""Manufaturters are also considering using cameras to watch that drivrs are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). So even though these cars are suppose to be driving themselves they still need the driver to be able to take over at any point during the ride. That is not be a ""driverless"" car. Futhermore, paragraph 8 states, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). It continues on to say, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?""(Driverless Cars Are Coming). But the question stands; why would someone want to wait on a car that at any point would need the driver to take over, which could be extremely dangerous, when they could be driving the enitre time and would not not have to worry about any of that? They would not because it makes no sense to put their life and the people around them lives in danger when they could just continue to drive their own vehicle just as they and everyone else have for centries.

In conclusion, the concept of a ""driverless"" car should stay just that a concept. It is not a smart descion to make and it only put the lives of everyone around in danger. Driverless cars are not only driverless but they are also careless; there is not any emotion behind a streering wheel if there is not a human being behind it. A computer does not know what to do in the different aspects the roads throw at drivers, like humans do. The driverless car should not be a development that should be taken seriously any time soon because it is extremeley dangerous and the cost of hospital bills from the incidents with a driverless car are going to be well over the cost of making them.",3,2,3,2,0,1,1,2,0
"There is an advantage in limiting car usage. There are three articles that will show you the advantage in limiting car usage.

In article, In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it says, ""VAUBAN, Germany-Residents of this upscale community are suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: they have given up their cars."" In this article you can tell that in Germany people have explored many places and they explored without the use of cars. Then, how do they get from one place to another? In the article it talks about Heidrun Walter, a media trianer and mother of two, walking through verant streets where the swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor. Heidrun Walter says, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" As you can see, when people drive it causes them to be tense. May be because they are afraid they will crash. While on the other hand, when they are walking they feel happy because they don't worry about someone hitting them, plus when they walk they enjoy the beauty of nature.

In article, Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, talks about banning the use of cars because cars are polluting the environment. It says, ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" As you can imagine many people didn't like the idea. The reactions of the people caused a big change. In the article it says, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered on Tuesday."" So the advantage Paris is doing is trying to make sure the environment doesn't get more polluted. Paris is trying to keep the environment clean.

Other article that gives an advantage in limiting the use of cars is, Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota by Andrew Selsky says, ""BOGOTA, Colombia-In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" As you can see, people in colombia are doing many things that does not involve the use of a car. They have a car-free day. The rection of the people having a car-free day is way different from the reaction of the people in Paris banning the use of cars. Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus says, ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating."" Bussinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Enrique Riera, the mayor of Asuncion, Paragauy says, ""These people are generating a revolotionary change, and this is crossing borders."" As you can tell from this article people are very happy in having a car-free day and they are making a huge difference in the environment.

These three articles show many advantages in limiting the use of cars. One they reduce the pollution cars are making when driving. Two it takes stress away from people. In the three articles it talks about people being stress or tense when driving. Having a day without a car relaxes them. Other advantage is that they enjoy walking around and seeing the beauty of nature. Which nature is another way to relax and not be stressed or tense. Would you take a day without a driving a car? Would you like to have a car-free day?",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"Think of how many car crashes a day steal loved ones away from us. Think of all the mothers and fathers, sons and duaghters, and friends that are gone as the result of someone's careless mistake. The resaons behind most crashes is plain old human error. Well, what if we removed human error from the equation? If we take the driver away from the wheel and put them in the passesnger side, imagine how drastically the rate of crashes would decrease.

In todays modern world of advanced technology, we already have cars that can nearly drive themsleves. As the artical points out, there are cars that can drive themselves except when complecations arise such as traffic jams and roadblocks. Google's Toyota Prius has multiple sensors that moniter the area around the car and allows the car to funtcion as if there was a driver behind the wheel. Sensors can also allow the car to brake faster than a human could in emergencies and reduce the power of the engine.

The laws reguarding computer driven cars are all concerned about saftey, as they should be. Although, if a company, such as googlel, could create a perfect driverless car, shouldn't those laws be changed instead to any driverless car must be thouroughly tested and cleared by an organization or group not apart of the company itself to make sure there are no problems whatsoever. Also, in the event of any accedent caused by the car, the blame should undesputibly fall onto the company. The risk of crash would be outweighed by the benefits of driverless cars, though. Even in the event of an unlikely crash, there would still be fewer crashes than ever before.

Another benefit driverless cars offer is the time saved. How many of us have been late to work, a meeting, or school bescause of traffic? Traffic is genereally cause by wrecks or roadwork. While roadwork cannot really be avoided, with driverless cars, there would be nearly no wrecks at all. Then no one would need to sit in a mile long traffic jam as someone else gets their promotion at work becasue they are not there. Also, no one would miss their turn or get stopped for running a red light and have to wait to get their ticket. As the saying goes, time is money.

Even thoug a toatlly driverless car has not been invented, we are very close. Along with the extra safety that comes with humans no longer driving, time wil be saved, along with money. Las wouold aslo be changed so that the passengers in the car would not be to fualt in the instence of an unlikley crash. With driverless cars on the rise, we have a safer, more adnaced future ahead of us.",3,3,2,3,0,1,1,3,2
"Years ago, when cars were first being developed, the idea that one would be able to practically drive itself probably would've been thought of as crazy. Cars themselves are such a grand example of technological wonder that one being able to handle major tasks on its own just seems like too much. However, here we are in 2016, and the concept of driverless cars being produced in mass and becoming a new normal is a real possibility. A possibility that, in the realm of safety and advancement, is promising.

The concept of driverless cars is nothing but a good idea. The safety that these cars could create on the road if enough people used them could be huge for the prevention of car crashes in the future, maybe even bringing us to a world in which the horrors of such accidents no longer happen at all. Efforts by Google and other companies to make such a scenario possible are close enough now to make it look as if it could really happen, but they aren't quite there yet. There's still work to be done, but the progress made so far points to a bright future in the world of automotive technology and on-road safety.

As of right now, concept models of driverless cars aren't exactly as driverless as they need to be yet. Efforts the likes of BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" assume a lot of the driving workload, but can't handle everything that a human driver can. Driverless car technology as of right now as a sort've driving crutch for people. It can get the job done, but you'll have to put in some effort yourself to get the full results. Driverless car technology right now is more like advanced assistance than anything, which is still a good thing, but it isn't enough. Humans still have too much involvement in the process to really be able to deem this cars ""driverless."" However, these measures towards true driverless technology are still positive ones in the name of safety, so there really isn't anything wrong with them, it's just that there needs to be more. Things like suggested heads-up displays and vibrating driver's seats are helpful, but they still involve the driver too much for it to really make much practical sense in the long run if the end result is a real driverless car. I guess you can't climb a tree without first starting at it's base, though, so I can't bash on this advancements too much because, all in all, they are just that: advancements towards a much bigger future goal. Look at these advancements as stepping stones to the eventual goal of a totally driverless on-road experience.

Another thing to consider when looking at the issue of driverless cars is the lawful implications involved with them. If someone behind the wheel of one of these driverless cars were to get into a crash, who would be at fault? I agree with the writer of this article in that there is a clear-cut issue here currently. However, I think with further advancement of this technology, crashes would be a thing of the past regardless, so these issues wouldn't even pop up. More states need to give this technology a chance rather than just outright banning its practice so that companies can work out the kinks so that the issues this practice is being banned over would eventually be non-issues anyways. Give these companies enough time, and this whole ""who would be at fault"" thing would never need to come up again if they got their way with further investment into these driverless projects.

All things considered, I don't think that there's an issue these companies couldn't solve regarding possible safety or lawful issues regarding driverless cars if they were just given enough time and resources to work with. I realize that these cars aren't actually driverless yet in the grand scheme of things, and I realize that in their current state they could bring up issues of liability to the law. But, with enough time, both of these things are simply obstacles that could be toppled with new technology. These companies involved in the creation of driverless cars are doing what they're doing for the betterment of driver safety and striving for the safest driving experience possible. I think we as a society owe it to them to give them a fair amount of time to complete this goal in its entirety. What we are seeing now is just a peak at what I'm sure is coming out of this driverless technology research, and I'm excited for the future of this field of study and hope that maybe, by the time thoughts of my first car purchase come around, it could be a driverless one. I know that, in the instance of my safety, that'd be really nice.",4,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3
"The challenge of Exploring Venus is that Venus sometimes called the Evening Star because is the one of the brightest points of the light in the night sky. Venus is the second planet from our sun. Sometimes people called the Earth twins because Venus is the cloest planet to Earth term of density and size. Between Venus and Mars is the sun because there sun goes in different speed. Venus can be a challenging because of the clouds and of the highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.

This shows that Venu's has a thick atmosphere of almos 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venu's temperatures average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what thet experiene on our own planet. The other thing is that Ven's has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our system. Beyond the high pressure and the heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediment like erupting volcanoes, pwerful earthquakes.

Venus can be a chanllenging because in Venus it has powerful earthquakes and also erupting volcanoes it's dangerous to be there because the temperature has the hottest surface of any other planets. Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

However Venus can be ship obriting or hovering safly far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because of the most forms of the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. People cannot take samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. They are challenging many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to there knowledge if Venus.

Now NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. There other project is called the mechanical computers. These devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940w during World War ll. All modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick, but they are tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Venu's has been the challenge it has been a value, but not only becuase of the insight to be gained, but also that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors. There travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited because by the dangers and doubts. It's really dangerous to be in Venu's because you never know what will happen in that planet.",1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now you may have heard of something on Mars that looked like a huge rock formation. You may have thought it was created by aliens, but here at NASA I am here to tell you that it's just a mesa.

Well in 1976 we discovered something on Mars that looked like a face! At first we thought it was something like what you think now, we thought it was aliens. The excitement was short lived for us because we ended up saying that ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa"" so that made it disappointing for us. You may say that the landform is created by aliens and we're just hiding it from you, but you're sorely mistaken because this discovery would help NASA as a whole if we did reveal it. That's just one of many reasons that we aren't lying about it being a landform.

Another reason that we are completely sure it's a landform is because we can't spot any sign of life on the face. As we said ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So even if you thought we were lying saying ""Oh this image is a lie they have secret ones that actually show that there's life on Mars in their building,"" you would have no clue that there's no reason for us to hide life being on Mars. We wouldn't have anything bad happen to us because we discovered life on Mars we would get rewarded for discovering life on Mars so why would we hide it?

And the last reason is that we have factual evidence and credibility to back up that there's no life on Mars. Like we said during this speech we said that ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" Later on we did it again in the speech ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" Said Garving. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real.

All together we have the proof that this special land formation on Mars that may look like aliens have built it, but it's just a simple mesa here on Earth something so common.",3,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The technology, Facial Action Coding System (FACS) was created to recognize peoples thoughts/emotions through a facial coding system by the muscles or movements in your face. Created by Prof. Thomas Huang, he tested it on Leonardo da Vinvi's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Not only does this technology just recognize your emotions, but on a computer, it can respond to your emotions as well. Dr. Huang's new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The real question is, would this be helpful or benefit us in a classroom? I think yes. The author states that ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar one might follow."" Can you imagine having a computer that knows when your happy or sad? Having computers like these in school classrooms would be so valuable, due to the lack of ""fun"" in school, these computers could determine when youre bored in class and change something about it. Or say you're learning a new lesson in math class, and you're becoming very confused. The computer would recognize your confusion by the facial expression you have and help you out. Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Another reason this technology would be helpful is because it would be less physical work and planning for the teacher. Teachers wouldn't have to deal with their students being bored, confused, or falling asleep in their class while they are teaching. This technology could greaty change the way class goes during a school day in many positive ways.

The new technology 'FACS' can encode any emotion of yours, this would be so helpful to us students in school for important reasons such as, being sad, or being confused. If so, the computer can modify things or help you out. Dr. Huang did an incredible job of creating this masterpiece, he stated that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional commnication, so computers need to understand that too."" This technology could change the world, since us humans now of days are so addicted to our phones. This computer can not only help us in school but be a new way of emotionally and physically communicating with other people. In school classrooms, and at home. The Facial Action Coding System is a very valuable thing.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"Driveress cars are in our future because of all the scientific innovations and new Technology, we will be able to work through all of the issues and problems. These cars could save countless lives and add to the safety of people going from place to place on their daily routine.

Each and every day people are getting up early and driving on a few hours asleep, which causes them to be less aware and cautious behind the wheel of a car,this is called drousy driving. People die from drousy driving each day and some people do it without noticing the dangers of not getting enough sleep. No one thinks about how just closing your eyes for a milisecond to a few seconds can kill someone, you could unconsciencely merge into the oppositre lane and harm someone. Drousy driving is not only dangerous for the person driving but for others around them and the people in the car with you. This is more prevelent with teenagers because they wake up, go to school, go to work and/or Athletics Practice, finish homework , sleep, and wake up and do it all over again. On average teenagers get 4-6 hours of sleep when they actually should get 8 hours of sleep to be healthy. An inexperienced sleepy teenage driver is just a bad combination, that could be avoided by the driverless cars. We would not have to worry about people falling asleep at the wheel because the car would be driving itself and whether the driver was asleep of not would not matter.

In general, with driverless cars there would be less accidents relating to distracted driving because these cars are able to brake themself before hitting things and function all on their own with little to no aide of a human driver. And sometimes the aide of a distracted driver can be as good as none.

Lots of accidents could be prevented by driverless cars because HUmans are not always the most observant to aware people. These Driverless ""Smart cars""

could drive themselves and be more aware of surroundings then a fatigued person driving,therefore preventing more accidents.",2,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,1
"The author supports the idea by telling us how Venus has great temperature. In the text it says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.' This means this eas the first time they've had great weather on 800 degrees. Venus is the closest place to visit. In the text it says "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains , and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.' Which mean Venus can possibly do space travel back in time. At tthirty-plus miles above surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degreea fahrenheit , but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentful , and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condtions , but survivable for humans.So its saying it only safe for hmans but other condtions.'However , peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditond because most forms of photography and videography ineffective. This means it only provived those things. In conclusion Venus was a great place to live and sttay at.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So I'm driving in my nice great black colored Handa with black rims and green neon lights. But let me stop there I do not want to get into all of the details of the car. Like i was saying i was driving and next thing you know BOOM!! I collided with a nasty old rusty out fo style truckand ruine my car. I called 1800-411-pain and they will handle it. I guess i have usage for this car anymore and I can just walk. my point i""m making is that you don't need a car to get you where you go all the time. citizens can use other sources of transportations. Citizens need to take advantages of limting car usage for the u. s. and the world. i'm going to i'm inform citizens about advantages of limiting car usage.

First of all, a lot of citizens love their cars like i did. What some citizens don't know that cars are dangrous. Well I think everybody know that because of all the accidents and crash but I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about the pollutions. That the air is being polluted. Secondly, That is not the only thing. Riding bikes, walking, taking the bus, and taking a cab can help stop pollution. Now I'm not talking about taking away all cars. We have to take advantages of limiting the car usage.

Honestly, walking is not that bad and so is riding a bike. It is really good workout. It is also safer than cars if you don't trip or fall off your bike.

Also citizens won't cause congestion. Citizens don't also have pay bill and loans for their cars if you don't have one. Now i know some people have job to get to, so all you have to do is to wake up early for work ride a bike or take the bus arrive to work on time. If you was late and something comes up just make up a lie about why you are. At least you are helping out the world. Most of all, when you drive a car then a cop stops you and give you a ticket even though you didn't do nothing wrong. You can avoid that by just taking a bus. Also going to waste money on gas and the bus only 2 dollars. Like I said I'm saying that you should get rid of your car. i'm saying take advantage of limiting car usage.

In otherwise, in Vauban, Germany life goes on without the usage of cars. As a result, 70 percent of vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. They had to give residents ticket if they drive their. All I'm trying to say is take advantage of limiting car usage.",2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,0
"Once again, it appears that people are glorifying the machine again and exalting it to a dominant position over society and humankind itself. Once again, people put quantity over quality, believing that something as complex and immaterial as human emotion can be quantified into a data set of integers and percentages.

This worship of machine, and the unjustified extension of its jurisdiction into domains it has no place whatsoever meddling with, finds itself expressed again in the recent technological concoction that is the ""Facial Action Coding System,"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, engineered and realized by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illinois and his colleagues. With this FACS, they believe that one's emotions can be easily identified and laid down on a neat percentage-based chart of X-percent this, Y-percent that. This technology, they believe, can be used in classrooms, as a means of ensuring a student's perpetual engagement in the lesson via improvisation of the lesson based on whatever calculations are made.

However, does one need to make a particular face to be bored, or confused? There are some faces we might make most of the time, possible some of us who make them all the time when losing interest or encountering confusion--however, that may not be so for all of us. There may be those whose faces might say, ""I understand the lesson,"" but their souls say ""What in the world is this?"" Similarly, their faces might say, ""I am intrigued by this,"" while within their hearts in reality, they are waiting for that relieving ring of the lunch bell to come upon their eardrums.

The human face is not a good indicator for emotion--if one wishes to be somewhat poetic, one could say that the human face is ""two-faced;"" It could tell you one emotion while hiding and masquerading another. One's face can be stern and mean-looking, while in fact underneath it lies the feeling of great satisfaction or relaxation. One's face can be happy and smiling (a physically genuine smile, too), maybe even laughing, while masquerading behind it, for some conscious or unconscious purpose, is a sorrowful melancholy that could wring tears from a stone.

In contrast to the thought behind this technology's premise, which claims that the human heart's imprints on the face can be ""classified [in to] six basic emotions--happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 3) I claim that human emotion can not be quantified. No one can rely upon the face to know the heart, just like no one can rely upon reason solely to know the Universe and the powers and Power beyond it. This technology should not be used in classrooms, or in fact anywhere really, for due to its erroneous foundation, there are bound to be erroneous results; not mere outliers, but I would say a significant chunk and portion of facial assessments. I am against the ""value"" of this technology being used to read students' emotions--for I am against this technology being used anywhere, and the false material-minded thinking which is its, and modernity's in general, foundational philosophy.",4,4,3,4,3,4,4,4,4
"I agree that we should give these car a chance to fundamentally change the world. My personal view of this is such a great idea. I strongly believe that these automakers would make the roads safer.

In this generation we have many people who like to text and drive or even snapchattng and drive .Why would we want teenager or even some adults to be on the road that aren't paying attention to their phones and the road ? Is that what we really want ? No we don't. With automakers the drivers would not have to worry about paying attention if they're driving right. Yeah maybe i see where their coming from, not passing the law because if the technology fails and causes an accident . But why would there be an accident if there would still be a driver in charge of that as well . A human brain with technology would be a perfect combination making it safe for everyone. There is so many kinds of problems in this world right now with driving and people not paying attenton to the roads . That is why if the techology does fail the driver would be in control and would be notified because the techology would give the driver the attention and giving the wheel to the driver. They would have sensors, computer hardware and software to make driving safe. The driverless cars would not only make the roads safer but it would make it better for the driver as well. It would be life changing.

So I think that driverless would be a great why to start off something different and would not cause as much accidents. It would be a smart idea to pass this law",2,3,0,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Venus is a challenging plant to explore but who doesn't like a challenge. However Venus

is the second plant

from our sun which makes it a little challenging to expoler. but also Venus nickname is a evening star becuase of it bright light points in the night sky. Now why

wouldn't you want to explore Venus?

Venus is Earth twin because of the camparison about how the size and density are the same. also that Venus it the closest to the earth. Venus speed is different from the Earth because of how the Earth, and Mars orbit around the sun sometimes the earth gets more closer to Mars than to venus which causes the speed difference. Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space. So our NASA friends had sent several spaecarfts to land on venus which none of the survived execpt for a few hours or some didn't even make it. but it also makes Venus more interesting to explore the plant and how to make the spacecarft last longer then a few hours.

The NASA sent somes humans to study Venus about their hostile conditions on their surface by hovering or a ship orbiting over Venus. Venus limited the ship to insight the grounds conditions so they wouldn't get rocks, gas, or anthing else from distance. so the scientists are trying to seek conduct mission to understand Venus but there are risk they have to take but they are not go to think of them as risk but challenges.

NASA is working on study Venus by building the ships to last for three weeks or more. so they are looking back at their own old mechanical computers and trying to fix what they did

wrong. They can now build

ships that flexible, powerful, quick, and they can handle the strong physcial conditions down there.

Venus is a challenging plant to explore but who doesn't like a challenge espcially when they came up with more ideas and built better ship to explore Venus. Venus has this curiostiy about it so i dont see why wouldn't want to explore Venus even if there challenges you have to face.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Say Yes to the Driverless Car

Driverless cars should be the thing of the future. They would make driving much more convienient for all drivers. There are so mant benificial traits that would come along with having driverless cars. For example if you're driving you encounter many other who are just plain reckless when it comes to driving. Having these cars though would for sure help make reckless encounters and accidents happen way less.

These cars have advanced technology to assit the driver of the car. One of them is the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". With the Traffic Jam Assistant it helps with anyone who is in rush hour. The beneficial help of automatic steering,acceleration, and breaking you are sure to be out of it in no time with the low percentage of an accident happening. Driverless cars are here to help improve driving, and make it more efficient for everyone.

There are more helpful traits these cars have including LIDAR. LIDAR is a spinning sensor that helps scope out the cars surroundings. Laser beams are also show a 3-D model of the car. Using the visual aid with the help out the car people can now see what is around them without bending their neck every which way to see around. This can help prevent crashing into things.

In this day and age people are helping improve these types of cars more and more. Driverless cars even include antilock breaks. Having these breaks help you when there are rollovers, and out-of-control skids. When the car might encounter something like this it will apply the right amount of pressure to the wheels to reduce the power from the engine. This technology in the car is far more advanced at driving than any human right now.

These cars are here to benefit the way people drive. By having cars like these there will for sure be a decrease in accidents. With less accidents everyone will be estatic.

Before you call me crazy and tell me that could never happen lets look at germany where people are trying to make a change in an upscale community where even soccer moms have given up there cars and 70 percent of the people there dont have cars and 57 percent sold there cars. now tell me do I sound crazy now besides people in that community were saying ""when i had a car i was always tense. im much happier this way "" which might sound shocking to you but i whould be happy too if our greenhouse gas and toxic in the air wasnt so high 12 percent of it comes  from cars and 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the usa. but all hope isnt done yet because the enviromental protection agency is promoting ""car ruduced"" communities. whick might save us from hurting the earth because a healthy planet makes happy people.

Further more if you still dont believe that this could effect us look at paris, paris typically has more smog than anyother european capital they found that paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 brussels and 79.7 percent in london reuters found now thats a life i dont want to life amagine the advantages we could have if we could live and just be healthier.

one of our advatages whould be clean air and less deaths  becuase the air we breath in can effect the way we think because if we take in bad were going to give out bad if we take in good we take out good. also parks and sports centers could be at a all time high now you wont have to nag your kid to leave the house he'll already be out before you say a word

In bogota, columbia where the clouds are gray but the ambition is strong even though its not stop rain the people say ""its a good opportunity to take stress away stress and lower air pollution"" and i think there doing a great job with this because its there 3rd strait year that they have banned cars and there pollution level is at a all time low. you see what this is showing you is that we dont have to face these challenges and disivantages that all these countrys are facing we can learn now and prosper on and not have to start ove like these countrys.

Last but not least  the end of the car culture  is near when miles driven in the united states is going down steadily the future of amaerica looks bright our peoples health seems better but all we need to do is one big leap and sacrfise to achieve a place where we dont have to be scared to leave our house and to not have to see your self in the news showing the damage your car did we can all live in a better place if we just try.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
Driverless cars are a bad idea it is better to stick with smart cars because smart cars are alot more helpful they can help the driver alot more. Driverless cars require massive upgrades to alread existing roads which cost alot of money. Smart cars can help the driver know when he has to be more carefull or when the roads are bad in the area he is driving and he could do what ever it takes to prevent and accident. GM smart cars have vibrating seats to warn the driver when its going to hit and object when its driving in reverse. Smart cars could handle trying up tp 25 mph but the sensors make sure that the driver keeps hand on the wheel. Manufactors are considering putting cameras to see when the driver loses focus on the road. Driverless cars are alot more dangerous because the driver won't have control over the wheel so if anything happens and the driver can get injured he is hoping that nothing wrong goes with the sensors. Driverless cars are a bad idea and smart cars are a better idea because all they have to do is add more things to smart cars and the smart car will be better.,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Changing the election by popluar vote for the President of the United States would be a better option than keeping the Electoral College. Although they have a meeting where they are voting for President and Vice President, doesn't the citizens of United States do the same thing. Since we help choose our states electors when we vote for which President we want, why can't our vote be the last vote to count?

Qualified citizens of the United States should have the final say so on who we want our President to be. We choose our President based off of what they said they will do to make the USA a better place. Instead of the citizens voting for a state elector we should vote for who we want President. Since we will be living in the type of envoriment they set.

The Electoral College is unfair to votes because of the winner take all system they have in each state. And if the Electoral College can't decide or have a tie , the election would be thrown to the House of Represetatives where  they vote on the President. What about what the citizen of the United States want our President to be?

Since the state legislatures are tehnically repsonible for picking the electors , those electors could always defy the will of the people. So leaving the vote up the elecotor is another reason why we should not keep the Electoral College. Citizens that vote can not control who the electors vote for. The electors can even get confused and vote for the wrong candidate. Or even take the advantage of thier own to vote for who they think is right, rather who the citizens wanted them to vote for.",2,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,1
"Venus, the planet right next to us, but the planet that can never be settled on. Throughout the article ''The Challenge of Exlporing Venus'' The author expresses the dangers and reasons why humans on earth have not been able to explore our neighboring planet. With that fact, the author still advocates for studying Venus and sites evidence for why this is needed. Overall, the author supports the study of the planet Venus because it's studies could inrich new knowledge about it to Earth. He supports this idea by stating Venus is similar to Earth, The study of Venis may allow fetaure pathways to increase it's study, and items learned form the experiment could lead to human settlement on the planet.

The author's claim of studying Venis could inrich new knowledge to Earth is supported through the two planets being so similar to each other. This is so because according to the author the two planets at one time shared similar charcterisics ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountins and craters.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Paragrpah 5) This evidence is relevent to the claim because the author proved that Venis and Earth are alike. Just like Venis, Earth has valleys, mountins and craters. The author's goal is to use this information to better know what this planet is, why it's important, gaining better human knowledge about the panet.

Futhermore the study of Venis is useful according to the author is because the planet could help NASA and other space comapnies in discovering the rest of outerspace. The author belives in if comapnies like NASA study space it would lead to better ways of getting more knowledge about the planet, '' Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribue meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Paragraph 6).

This is meaningful information because it supports inovation in space and what the author invesions of the future. The author's claim is support Venis can be a steepingstone into humans futher knowledge of space. This suports inriching new knowledge to Earth

Finally the author's call for the study of Venus could inrich knowledge to earth because there is a chance that humans could settle on the planet. This can be said because the explorations of Venus could be survivable for humans, ''Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.'' (The Challenge of Exploring Venis, Paragraph 5) This information that the author gives is motivation for humans to discover the planet Venus because humans in the future could settle on the planet. This would support the claim because in the future if earth continues to have issues with climate change and globle warming there might be exploration to other planets. Having more knowledge about Venus could gives humans a chance in the distant future to inhabit a new planet.

Overall the author suppirts inhabbiting Venus because he or she belives that humans on earth can benufit from it. The author sites in the article that the Earth and Venis are similar planets, increases in techonolgy could go along with the exploration and the study could give humans in the distant future to inhabbit Venus. So the aiuthor looks upright.",4,2,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Hi my name is Luke and I am person who is working in two part jobs. I work at a grocery store and a bank. My friend Don invited me to join the Europe on a cattle boat. It helps people in need of food, a home, farming and much more.

It is called the UNRRA meaning the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. I want more people to come and help because you are doing a deed to people around the world that needs your help with farming,getting food, and getting a home. The UNRRA has over 44 nations helping with these people in need, but we need more. ''The cattle-boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy''. I had lots of fun times on the boat as well. This is not just work it is also about fun. When we travel to give people stuff in need, we will play games like Tennis, volleyball, baseball, pool, and much more activities to do.

I think that you should come down to the UNRRA. First, you are helping people that needs it. Second, You can come and hang out also have fun when doing it. Third, it's an unbelievable deal for a small-town boy.",1,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,2
"The use of cars around the world are having an impact on the envoirnment today.  Being able to limit the use of cars would be benifical to your wellbeing and the enviornment.

In Vauban, Germany there is a suburb that doesn't have any cars. People are allowed to own cars but there are only two places to park, which are the two large garages at the edge of the development. Also the owner must pay $40,000 for a space, along with a home. The majority of the residents do not own cars and say they are happier this way. This community is an example that is trending throughout Europe, and is trying to kick start a movement called ""smart planning"". ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States""(Rosenthal 5). The air is becoming very polluted and there are efforts being made to try and fix the issue.

In Paris, there was a day of near-record pollution. They decided to enforce a law banning certain cars on certain days to try and help clear the air. On Modays, people with even-numbered licence plates had to leave there cars at home or pay a fine of 22-euro or $31. About 4,000 people were fined that day. The congestion was down 60% in paris as well, and the smo cleared up enough monday for the French to decide on the banning of odd-numbered plates on Tuesday also.

Aslo in Bogota, Colombia there is a day without cars. There goal is to promotes alternative transportation and reduce the amount of smog. Anyone who violated this law was fined $25. "" It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said buisinessman  Carlos Arturo Plaza(selsky 24). This trend is spreading, with other Colombian cites joining the event.

The end of car culture is among us in the United States. Studies have shown that people are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licences as the years go by. The number of miles driven in the United states peaked in 2005 and is steadily dropping . As of April 2013, that number has dropped by about 9% and is equal to where the United states was in January 1995. The new generation are not finding drivin or even etting a licence a priorty anymore. They plan there work and social life by were they can walk or use a alternative  transportation. Bills are being made to help with the amount of pollution made by cars and are trying to gie the people more opportunities to use alternative transportations.

The amount of pollution created by cars are effecting our envoirnment. As shown in the example of paris, that by limiting the amount of cars o the road you can prevent some of the air pollution increasing the quaility of the air. Also not having to worry about driving has decreased stress in some cases. Overall limiting car usage would be beneficial to your wellbeing and the enviornment.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"Hi I am Luke and I was in a job on a boat called a cattle boat. I was on the boat for about two years and it was amzing. The job is all about getting cattle acores the oceans to other countres because of World War II.

The Nazies done a lot of work to destroy theso countery and they need food and supplys to get back on their feet and they make a great counrty once again. This job in opioun is the best because we get to go to other countris and give them supplys for them to get back on their feet to once great again. I did this for two years straight and had a blast and we even got so much free time that I got to take a tour around a caltle on our way to chine and I had a blast also got see Greece and other amzaing conutries. I also I got a trip to italy and got to ride the strits of their beatful town. So this was a good trip for me a small-town city boy. On the way home we got to play sports like baseball, vollyball, table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing reading whittling, and games to pass the time for the two years.

So this jobeis good ofr some people if they wanted to see the world and to sail around the world and have a adventure and exting two years about cattle boating but keep in mind it is very dangers to cattle boatign so that is some reason to cattle boating and so I hope you would like this job.",1,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Driverless cars are not an good idea, it would be absolutely insane.

To begin, I strongly disagree with driveless cars, because people love to be in control. For an example, a marriage relationship the husbad and the wife both think their in control or want to be.. Do you actully think that people will let go of their saftey for a car that drives on its own? Can the American citizen trust a car that on its own?

Also if the car can drive on its own what the point of a person getting their lisense. Or what about an whole sport create from driving Nascar. This would be an perfect upset for a roit. You have owners of the driving sports losing money for an driveless car that is not really safe. For an example, think about tapes and cds how they drop in production. Since poeple have ipods mp3s,itunes, and phones their no need to keep making production for music. So to bring back the driveless car could evn make the economy at drop.

To carry forward, is the nation ready for the change, theirs a prieod of time with everything. Are we sure that us humans are not jumping into things to fast.

For an example, the Model -T the nation rode on horses very long time before Ford became the new era. even with the horse they did revole many they had the invention on the light bug with the horse carriage. Putting out the driveless car can really hurt the nation maybe we should all just think about what we all are doing and see if we really do need the change.",1,3,0,1,0,0,0,1,0
"In ""The Challenage of Exploring Venus,"" the author claims on how studying venus would be a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The Author backs up this claim by incluiding inforamation in pargraph 7 that involes Nasa delvoping ""elctronics made up of silicon cardide that is being tested in a chamber to simulate Venus acidfied surface."" Pargraph 7, also includes that Nasa is ""using old technology known as Mechinal computers, which uses gears and leavers which are more deriable in venus atmosphere."" Nasa hopes delvoping these electronics could help scientist get a personal close up that could help researches to find out if Venus was once an earth like planet that once able to support life.

However, in paragraph 3 the authour mentions that Venus can reach an

""average tempture of 800 degress ferinhight,"" and Venus having an ""atmopseric pressure that is 90 times gratter than planet earth. Not to mention Venus enviorment causes powerful earthquakes, and lighting strikes that mainly target the ground. Then in paragraph 5 the authour adress the issue by claming ""that Nasa would allow scientist to float around the planet, so they can research planet without worrying that Venus sulferic acid would not melt the rocket, and the scientist.""

However this also dosen't rectify the problem because paragraph 6 debunks the solution by claiming that ""perring at Venus from a ship that is oberting the planet, would not allow most forms of light to pentrate venus dense atmosphere , which effect the photography that would make it immposabile for scientist to even attempt studying the plantes rocks, and geographical fetaures.

Inconclusion, scentist should probally put off the project because earth has not delovped the technology would be most likely destoryed once it reaches venus. Instead Scientist should begin the project once we have delvoped the apporiate equitment that can wuithstand Venus harsh enviorment, temptures, and pressure.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Driverless cars are one of the world's most interesting

transportation systems yet to come. Even though the cars are not truly driverless they still can have many benifits that are better than transportation today.

The driverless cars are expected to come in the near future. The first company that is expected to have the first model of the driveless car is Google. Google has been working on this project for years to find a way to make the perfect model. Many companies will follow after google once they hear the pros about the newest google invention for transportation. Companies such as ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and

Nissan plan to have that car that can drive themselves by the year of 2020,""(paragraph 10). This is an example on how companies are going to follow after google makes the new system and they see how much their marketing has increased by. This car is not only popular for it's look and ability to go the perfect speed, But this car will also be good for safety reasons. If the car is in a troubled situtation, it will alert the driver that they need to take control of the car until they are able to regain stability and are out of the troubled area. The cars are able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but the cares are designed to notify when the driver needs to take control. All these cars are creating special small little parts to add on to their car to give their customers a little bit of a feel of how it feels to have something done for you that you usually have to do. They add a new gadget everytime they create a new model. Cars in the future are going to be nothing like the cars we use today.

In conclusion driverless cars are a huge invetion that will change life in the future different than how it is today. Driverless cars are going to make life a whole lot easier once they make the perfect model. These new and improved super cars will make life better and safer. Driverless cares may be fun but what is really important, is how the amount of safety will increase with this design",3,2,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"The authors supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is that NASA is sending humans to study Venus and the difference between Earth and Venus. Humans cannot lived or survived the landing for a few hours. The planet for humans to study can not lived there because the planet is hot to lived for humans, it 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the clouds are sulfuric acid. The NASA want to see if it safe for humans to lived or not, and humans can study there or not. So, the travels on Earth should not go there for the dangers and doubts but should be safe here on Earth.

The difference between Earth and Venus is they are twin, closest planet to Earth, and there density and size. For example, Venus temperature is the highest than earth, ""A thick atmosphhere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" And ""Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on our own planet."" This means that Venus temperature and atmosphere is hotter than Earth and 97 percent carbon dioxide. Another example for Venus is, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" Probably today, Venus could have some features familiar to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters.

The authors supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is that NASA is sending humans to study Venus and the the diiference between Earth and Venus. Venus can be dangers to the humans. Humans curiosity can study for Venus but not actually going there because they would melted or dies in a minute or 2 minutes.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Car use. Everyone has a car, most everyone for that matter. Even tho they are wonderfull, look cool, and sound cool. They arnet the best thing for this earth. For instence, cars give off egsost that harms the earths atmosphear and helps global warming grow, witch is not good. They also kill millions per year with no intention of harming anyone. Last and formost the cost way to much money and drive people into the ground. (no pun intended)

Let me explain. If almost everyone on this earth has a car, some have 2 or more or some dont have any, and if there is 7 billion people on this earth. Do the math, thats around 14 billion cars driving around, and eatch one of those cars give off exsost that hurts the enviroment. The earth has a layer ever it called the ozone layer and protects the harmfull sunrays from hurting life on earth. But with cars driving around that hurts the ozone layer.

Also, cars kill many people per year. Car acsiddebts are a random event that happens when soneone night be on there phone. Or talking on their phoe. Maybe even just not payibg atetion. Another big problem is drunk driving. Someone will be out partying or haveing some drinks at a bar, and gets drunk and unable to drive. But still dose it anyway. That causes alot of crashes to and kills many people.

Last and formost. Making people go poor and loos their money. When you buy a car you can get insurance, but if you dont, and crash into someone elses car, you will have to play for their insurence untill the car if fixed.

Are sister planet is truely a mystery Although some people whould say it is a waste of time, it is important because it could prove there was it is like there, it could have highly benifical materials, it would prove we can do it.

there is a problom with us get there and stay there for mor than a second. We do not know much about the land but there are mountains, caverns, and volcanoes. The weather is not very good ether there are frequant lightning storms and powerful earthquakes. The atomosphere is high crosive in the clouds at least.

With the pressure of Venus below sea level there is no dought there is new materials there. The entire ground is made up of sedimant rocks that can with stand the sulfic acid. If we could get some it would be easyer to go there and last alot longer. This how ever would be extremly difficult because we need something that could withstand it to get it and come back.

Some Astronimers and scientists just want to prove thay can do it. everyone is working together to make this happen. The failure will not stop some people it will just drive them to do it even more. They may do it just to due it but all around they just will do what ever it takes.

"Driverless cars are too expensive, they're more expensive than a mercedes benz. Having a driverless vechile can have it's positive and negative side because for one the car signals the driver when it's their turn to take over, but can panick the driver, therefore i am against the driverless cars they have too many issues that can appear.

Driverless car can have the driver panick because what if the sound for the driver to know it's their turn goes out? or what if the car breaks down in the middle of the highway during rush hour? things like that can have the buyer second guessing on weather they should buy the car or not. The opposing side would say that, at least the car has sensors that can alert the drivers when backing in and out a driveway oe parking space, or that they keep the drivers alert on the roads when the driver gets to close to another car or too close to the back of the car.

Driverless cars has many ups and downs, they say that they create a sensor to where the driver has to keep hold of the wheel at all times no matter, also that the car can steer and accelerate it's self which makes it hazerdorus because the car can start to malfunction wrong to where the driver don't feel safe or it's holding up traffic. Maufactures wants to put cameras in the cars to make sure that all drivers are staying focused and not getting distracted, that would be invading privacy and other code laws.

Some say that if the was to get into a car accident who would they blame the manufactures or the driver? well, to say they can blame the manufactures because they created a car that drive on it's own and the car can stop or break down whenever and however, but they can also blame the driver because they may never know it could of been the driver lack of attention on the road. That would be the biggest concern for most people, who would be the blame if something was to happen and the driver or anyone gets hurt.

Dr. Wener Huber says that there hoping to bring some kind of fun to the drivers while driving, like a new way of driving with entertainment and a heads up display, but why would anyone want to bring entertainment to the drivers if they have to stay focus on thde road.

Using the Facial Action Coding System could help improve someones emotional state by quickly seeing what their emotions are and if they are feeling down you can give them a hug and increase their emotions. If the Facial Action Coding System was a real life tool we could see many changes in peoples behaviors as well. Having a good behavior can make a good impact on your life and also a good reputation. The world can be seen as a different place if we all have good behaviors and good emotions because people will be a lot respectful and mindful of other human beings.

"In the article ""The Challenge of exploring Venus"" the author describes why humans should continue to explore Venus. The Author of the article makes several convincing claims throughout said article.

One example is in paragraph four it states that long ago Venus was very Earth like in the fact that it was largly covered in ocean. As most of us have been taught that water is essential for all life to be able to survive. Venus also has many geological features similar to Earth in that it has valleys,mountains,and craters. These similarities make us curious and what to ask the question if Venus was so Earth like then did it ever contain living organisms? Also we must ask ourselves could it ever sustain life.

Another factor that makes humanity so curious about Venus as it states in paragraph four as well that Venus is one of our nearest options for a planetary visit. Imagine looking up at clear stary night and along with the pale face of the moon and the twinkling of the stars. You would see a shining glow in the distance wondering what could it be what is going on there and can I visit it. For Venus it is entirely possible to do so.

Though one might say that the author gave too many negative factors to visiting Venus. Yes he does but these are but challenges in the way of human curiosity. Yes the air might be ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide yes the surface might temperature might be eight hundred degrees. Can these challenges stand in the way of human injanuity and our will to discover the unkown. No nothing can stand in the way of human curiosity. For eaxample in Pragraph seven it states that NASA is working on other approaches such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This invention has even been tested by the simulated chaos of Venus and it lasted for three weeks.

Though we might not be ready yet for our long awaited visit to Venus it will adventualy be possible. I might not live to see it but in the wake of human curiosity and the will to discover the unkown nothing can stand in our way. Nothing will stop us from reaching for the stars.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"The future is a huge thing that manny people plan on having to be big. New technology, devices, transportation, homes, and many other things that make life easy will eventuually be turned into something more advanced. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. As for my opinion, I believe these driverless cars should be made even with a few difficulties, these cars are possible to be driven as the future developes.

As the article begins, it asks, ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" and when I think about that question, my response is, yes. I could imagine a time, the time of the future, where everything is advanced and especially the use of transportation. The article explains how others have been fascinated of driverless cars as well and quotes, ""Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves.""

Car companies started to wondering on how to create driverless cars and many start off with computer driven cars or something simple. ""In the late 1950s, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track. Engineers at Berkeley tried something similar, but they used magnets with alternating polarity. These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" Not many were successful but that didn't stop other companies from trying.

For any type of car, safety was the most important thing and driverless cars will obviously have that as well. As cars began to advanced, so did their safety. Sensors were created, video cameras on the rearview mirror and many other kind of sensors. ""Sensors are nothing new, of course. In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheel in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-contril skids or rollovers."" The creation of new cars were in the minds of many engineers and even until now many more ideas are being brought, tested and invented. ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.

Driverless cars are possible and clearly can be safe to use. Many are just waiting on the law for the approval. As soon as these cars are able to be used, the future is creeping its way up on huamanity. Many are being tested and it's only a matter of time for the future to happen and I could imagine how the world will be with driverless cars.",3,2,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College has been around for many years now and chosen who would become president of our country. I believe that you should stop listening to the Electoral College on who will be the new president and start listening to the citizens of the United States. We are the ones who know what we want and who we feel will be a great leader for our country.

When citizens vote its known as the popular vote. Even though we vote every four years, its honestly a waste of time because the Electoral College doesnt care what we think. What matters to them is that they make the final decision on which president they think we care about more. Its not fair to us! We deserve a say in who we want to lead us in the right direction.

Back in the 1960's, segregationists in Louisiana's legislature just about succeeded in changing the Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy. If they succeeded, John F. Kennedy would have never became presedent even though the popular vote wanted him.

In Conclusion, I think its best to take away the Electoral College while we are voting for a president. The people have the right to choose who they feel will be the most honest and most loyal president to run our country. Thank you for taking the time to read this and hear what i believe should be done.

Sincerely,

PROPER_NAME",1,3,2,3,1,1,2,1,2
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.

The election process should be changed to one decided by popular vote instead of using the process of the Electoral College. First of all source two states that voters can sometimes get confused on the candidate that they actually voted for since they're not direclty voting for the President. Another flaw of the Electoral College also stated in source two is that ""... ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please...."" That is pure lying. That basically just made that voter vote for the candidate that they did not want. Another critical error is that in the process of the Electoral College is that not all states are equally represented. For example if there is a tie in the Electoral vote the election would be handed to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the presedent. This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representativ from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representative from California would represent 35 million voters. That hardly seems fair.

With Popular vote every American would get their say in a democratic way. As source three states ""... the Electoral College is not democratic in a modern sense. With popular vote everyone would be represented equally.

I understand that ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" causes less chance of a dispute over the Electoral college than of the popular vote, but not everyone really gets a say. Also i understand that the Electoral College avoids run off elections but that is still very rare.

State Senator it's time to abolish the Electoral college, and switch to the use of popular vote for elections.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,2,1
"Driverless cars appear to be the future of road but they have many down sides to them. Computer controlled cars can have glitches and many other technical problems when being used as the futures transportation. If the computer does giltch whos fault is it for the injury or death of the person. It could go either way but man contolled cars have only one or two people to blame for the accident that may happen.

""Todays driverless cars can steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" This quote said in paragraph 7 shows that these cars can not do everything so it is misleading to the user. The user will sit down in the car and tell the car where to go and the user most likely fall asleep or get tired of waiting for their turn as said in paragraph 8. Then when the car comes across a situation it can not solve its self many things could go wrong and then whos fault would it be for the accident the car would cause. The rules of the road most of us are taught as a child would be changed a lot also. They would have to develop a new way of giving tickets to those who break the driving laws with the new driverless cars. The new driver safety laws would give many police officials confusion

when giving driving tickets to people.

The driverless car as of now sounds like bad news, it needs more to it so that we can keep our people safe on the road. In the near future dreverless cars would and can be a very useful addition to the road. All we need is more time to this idea of driverless cars and it has the potential to change driving as we know it.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The car is one of the most important inventions, but it's taking so much in our life style

The car is one of the most important inventions on the human history, they give us a big adventage in the second world war, and after that, they do our life more easier, because with they we can travel big distances and be fast in other places like work or malls etc, but in the actuality is so nessesary.

In the ""world of today"" the cars are an obligation to everyone, because the people can't go walking to every site because today all the paces are so far from our houses, the people who lives in the suburbs just can't go to anywhere walkin they need a car or take the public transport, so they need other way to go anywhere without a car, like in the city of Vauban Germany, the people in Vauban goe's to the soccer games to the mall leave theyr childs in the school and everithing whitout a car!, the people in Vauban don't have a car because it's so expensive have one, in Vauabn if you want a house with a parking site you need to pay $40.000 dollars!, that's so much money and as a result of this the 70% of the Vauban's families don't have car, and a 57% of this families sold his car.

As a result of the experiment in Vauban's, the suburb's goes more small and more closely to everything doing the people more happy with this new life style, maybe we can lear something with this people.",1,2,3,2,0,0,1,2,0
"I remember the stories my dad use to tell me about how in cuba he would have to walk 6 miles to get to school. Or when he got here that to work he would ride his bike to & from work. Cars are being put into use for no reason, people now a days go in the car to to the winn dixie thats right across the street. Do you know how much money is put into cars? you have to pay for gas, or if your car breaks down or has a leak. Cars are a huge investment and they are very dangerous to our society, the pollution cars cause i horrendous. Now don't get me wrong I would prefer to go in a car on a 3 hour ride to Orlando from Naples, i mean who would want to walk 1000s of miles? but to get in the car to get dropped off at school when you live 5 minutes away? thats ridiculous.

In Germany car use has been dropping and it has proven to provide a cleaner enviorment, healthier living and huge savings. Near the French and Swiss borders, it is forbidden to have hoe garages, street parking and drive ways. The streets are considered to be car-free zone. There are a few streets that cars are allowed, you can park in a larage car garage or at the edge of a development. But the parkng space is not free the parking space in $40,000, along with a home. Obviously that price is alittle bit pricey for people so 70% of theses families do not own cars and 50% acctually sold a car to be able to live there. The Enviormental Protection Agency is strongly trying to promote reducing cars and/or car usage all throughout the united states.

What comes to your head when you think about Paris? love, romance, coffee shops, expensive dinners on the effile tower. How about pollution, having to stay inside because the health cocerns? Paris has recently banned driving due to the pollution revolving th city of love. Motorists ere requested to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 dollar fine, to some people the $31 dollars did not effect them so they kept driving and were fined. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had there cars impounded due to innappropriate reaction to recieving this fine. After 5 days of what frances citizens would call torture 60% of congestion was down, believe it or not Paris was rivaling Beijing, China known for having one of the most polluted streets in the world! The blame was put on diesel fuel, 67% of frances cars use diesel engines. Paris has moresmog than other european captials like london or brussels. Imagine how much clearer Paris would be if this car ban lasted a year!

Imagine how nice it would be to have zero traffic, no rush to get home. but how would you feel if the reason behind this traffic free day you had to ride a bike or go on the bus? you would probably take that traffic over a little exercise or having to stand next to a stranger. In Bogota, Colombia the have a event called ""a car-free day"" in this day colombians all gathered as they skated, biked or rode the bus to get to their destination. If you violated this you would have to fance a $25 dollar fine. The goalpf this even was to promote alternative transportation but to also hope for less smog. During this day not even rain could stop these colombians from participating in this event. Some people saw this as a save the world act also to relieve stress.

Cars are a way to travel long distances and should be used every once in a while but the world is asking you please put an end to this, use of cars for every little thing, start to set a goal to live a happier healthier life and create a safe eviorment by ending car use, Start small like riding a bycicle to the grocery store, then decide to take a walk to the neighbors right around the street.",4,3,3,3,0,1,2,2,1
"Schools should use facial action coding system because its use full for school.

One reason why schools should use facial action coding system because it can be use full for health classes. health classes effect how much your emotions affect your body for example if you're always depressed you'll have a chance that your body might suffer from something and you might have a hard time to bring your body to stay strong again after suffering from depression and if your always happy you won't have a problem.

My Second reason why schools should use facial action coding because a day on a test. A day on a test you'll have a emotion that you don't wanna take it or just too lazy to do the test and might end up the person guessing all the problems and not even caring. The next day they would see there scores in the test and be embarassed because they got there score low.

My Third reason why schools should use facial action coding because incase of a fight. People might be angry and might take there anger away on someone else and it could manage to start a fight that's why you can check on them and ask why are they angry and calm them down. You never know if that could happen so always be prepared.",1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"The new technology called Facial Action Coding System classify peoples emotions by using avanced technology. This technology can help students find out why they can't focus or why they are having trouble learning new things.

Facial Action Coding System can classify a human emotions better than a human can classify another humans emotions.

Facial Action Coding System can show which emotion and how much of that emotion is felt. Facial Action Coding System been tested on the Mona Lisa and has shown that ""she's 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". No human can classify every percent of every emotion a person has.

"Venus is an interesting planet for various reasons.

Scientists believe that Venus is alike to earth. It has about the same density and size compared to earth. In the article it states in paragraph 4 that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" This quote helps state that it is a interesting planet and alike Earth they want to study and learn about it knowing the conditons.

Another example of how Venus is an interesting planet is because of the atmosphere and the ground conditions it has. Astronomers believe humans could survive there, however it wouldn't be easy with the conditions it has. A beam of light can barely pass throught the atmosphere; this causes the standard cameras to be ineffective.

In conclusion, Venus is a very interesting planet and despite the dangers it has, it is worth it to study.

"Driveless cars should'nt be allowed to be on the road. I dont think it's a good idea because drivers will not remain fully focused on the road, drivers will get bored waiting for their turns to drive, and if these cars were to create an accident it would be a ""who to blame"" case.

Starting off by sayin drvers will not remain fully focused on the road should be enough of a red flag to make it a no. In paragraph 7, it may state "" The human driver must remain alret and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" but, if a car is doing all the driving, it's giving the driver time to get distracted. They are now given easier access to text and drive, make phone calls, and attempt other tasks they have no business doing while driving. Making being on the road a dangerous place.

Secondly, like the question asked in paragraph 8, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Boredom to me leads to messing with other objects around me and losing focus. That's what will happen. Later to say, ""We have to interpret the driving in a fun way."" Driving is not supposed to be fun. You're supposed to get in and take yourself from point a to point b. The passage also talks a sort of bringing in an ""in-car entertainment system"". Just another distraction in my opinion, once again, making the road a dangerous place!

Lastly, and most importantly, if an accident would to come of these cars driving the road, who would be the one to blame? The question is aslo found in paragraph 9. The drivers would become so dependent of the car and trust it not to get them into an accident. While the manufactures are dependent on the law to pass a law so they don't get taken down with the lawsuit of an accident their cars are responsible for. They do not want to help you, they want your money.

Closing this with a stong statement: you cannot expect a driver to have such this nice of a creation in their possession and not fully confide in it. They're going to get distracted because they're allowed to now that something else is doing the driving. They're going to get bored, because now, they are hardly needed. These drivers would expect the manufacturers to take care of any problem created with the car, because of the fact that the car was the one doing the driving.",3,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Cars have been around for awile now and they seem to have developed into our everyday lifestykes. But for some countries there is no such thing. Having limited car usage can be great in some cases. It could really help the envirorment effectiviely, Provide less funds for people, and even challenge companies to pursue a bigger idea than just cars.

Our ecosystem is in dangered. All of the pollutio and waste that people put into the air needs to stop. The idea of having imited use of cars can provide a healthy and great looking earth. In the article by Robert Duffer ''Paris bans driving due to smog'' we see the understanding that paris can help support the idea for having limited usage of cars. ''After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city'' a sentence stated in the article. Paris typically has more smog than other european captials. ''Last week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (pm) per cubic meter comparied with 114 in brussles and 79.7 in london''. With nobody driving their cars for a day, they managed to clear up alot of smog and make the earth look healty again.

Having the idea for limiting car usage can also have a very big impacted on people financal funds. its common sense. Not having to pay for gas, car insurance, car payments, and even mechanical payments as well. And having not having to pay so much of those bills can provide person with a greater amount of cash in their pocket. But there can be a down side to not having a car also. Cars are made to get a person from one place to another and if there isnt any transportation how are you supposed to go to work or make some food stops. The solution is simple. Ride the bus, Walk, Bike, get some exercise for once, thats the biggest reason why america is  so lazy.

Car compaines such as Ford, Dodge, Toyota all compete with one another. But as the days go on by. Studies state that less and less people are buying cars. In the article ''The end of the car culture'' by Elisabeth Rosenthal states that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes on by. This has left researches pondering a fundamental question: Has america passes peak driving? My answer would simply be, No america has not passed peak driving, but how can you by a car and pay a buncg of bills with no money? Thats my question. People dream of cars everyday. Wishing they could drive a brand new converible Ferrari to school. But welcome to reality, were that really doesnt happen. And are economy does not help it one bit. ''at the Mobile Congress last uerar in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford motor company, Laid out a business paln. Discussing things like trying to collab with the telecommunications industry''. This could be and opening for are future. It could save times around a city and ensure that its also safe at the same time.

In conclusion the advantages of limiting car usage can provide the earth, the earth, the people, and Finance to be nice, beautiful, and simple. But nothing can happen if we ont act now.",2,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(source 2). Cars have been a great help to people but now their boarding the line of help and hurt. The advantages of limiting car usage almost never end. There's always a way for you to limit your use of your car. It's great for the plant. Also it brings ease to you. Then last is that it brings people together.

To began with is that it's great for there plant. For example in Bogota, Colombia every year for three years they would have a car free day. That is when everyone would leave their cars at home and use a bike or some alternative transportation to get to were they have to be. If you choose to do the opposite then you would be fined a $25 fee for using your car. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. This also happens in Paris, were they banned cars because of smog. Even if the fee was $31 dollar Almost 4,ooo drivers were fined.

In addition to that is that it brings ease to you. Stated in the first source, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Heidrun Walter said that. When you don't have to think about any car problem you worry less. Even now there has been a decline in the percentage of 16- to 39-year-old's getting a licenses. It's not a priority anymore. With cars comes worries, and people today don't want any worries.

Last but not last is that it brings people together. Usual when we are driving in our cars we hardly look to see who's driving next to us. But if you take out the cars you can really see wants around you. Meet people while you ride your bicycles. You would see the world in a different way.

In conclusion, limiting cars would benefit you in so many way. One like bringing you closer to the people around you. Also without as many cars it would help the plant. Last it would bring ease to you. Overall the less the cars the better everyone and everything should feel.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,1,0
"Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to ""curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are ""going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1).Some advantages of limiting car usage is people are happier without cars and it promotes the alternative transportation and reduce smog.

The first advantage of limiting car usage is that people are happier without cars. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor"" (Selsky, Paragraph 27). ""As a result, 70 pecent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"""" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 3). ""It was the third straight year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without cars in this capital city of 7 million"" (Selsky, Paragraph 21). ""Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a movement called ""smart planning""""(Rosenthal, Paragraph 4). Finally ""the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 35).

The second advantage of limiting car usage is that it promotes the alternative transportation and it reduces smog. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, Paragraph 10). ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog . . . [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known os one of the most polluted cities in the world"" (Duffer, Paragraph 14). ""millions of colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Selsky, Paragraph 20). Also ""the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped speadily thereafter.... As of April 2013, the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 32). And ""people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession mat find less reason to resum the habit"" (Rosenthal,Paragraph 36). But finally ""Mine (19 and 21) have not botheres to get a driver's license, even though they both live in places where one could come in handy. They organize their summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 39).

And those are the reasons why some cities are making themselves car-free. People are a lot more happy with no cars as said from Elisabeth Rosenthal """"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"". And also because people are trying to promote the alternative transportation and reduce smog, thats why Paris ""enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"" (Duffer, Paragraph 10). So what do you think should citites ban driving?",1,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1

Now It can find interesting things you like to read and it make people want to read. This machine also help the teachers cause they can't help every student if they have a class of 30 student.

This is were this solfware go wrong human have way more then six emotions. These emotion we have is very complicated to the point that we don't understand them some times. For a machine to change how we learn on facail expresion is bad because we can be sick and it change the actical cause it thing we are bored or disgusted. That might really like that artical. The same can be said if a person is in pain it can say that person is angry or sad. This is the big flaw with this machine even if it is rightthe teacher or someone can go look back at that and see everything you are feeling. that can be alittle to personal for some people.

This is my thought aboot the solfware. It is very great, and can be very helpful for a lot of people. The big flaws with it is that itcan be to personal for some people. The other big flaw with it the emotion part it vision it to narrow it need to be widen up cause it emotion people it might cagorize it under something it might not be.",2,3,0,1,0,0,0,2,0
"Venus, the second planet from our sun, the ""Evening Star"" as some say is referred to as Earth's ""twin."" The atmosphere of this raging planet is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, the clouds are formed of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. This planet named Venus is deemed inhospitable by the author of this passage, yet the author feels he/she should express and support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author supports the idea that Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also includes the statement that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working on different types of equipment to be able to behold many different methods to send technology to Venus. The author states that this technology will allow humans to further understand Venus's complex array of difficulties presented by wanting to send exploration teams to the planet.

The author allows the reader to have a clear view into why it is valuable to be able to have the tools to explore Venus in the near future. He/she shows that human curiosity could lead us into situations where we need this certain technology to help us with different challenges presented in the future. Humans have a lot to learn not only about the problems we face when trying to meet exploration needs, but to gain the valuable insight the author states learning about Venus has. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus could lead humans into expanding their knowledge to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation the author feels so strongly that humans should aspire to reach.",2,4,3,4,2,2,3,3,3
"This technology is kinda dumb. We don't need this to be able to tell how a person is feeling. You can just tell by their facial expressions and how their moods are. Like it said in pharagraph 8 "" Muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes"". ""In a fake smile you can tell the difference between a real smile and a forced one because in a fake smile the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic mayjor and different muscle, the risorius.""

So no I really don't think it's something we need to be able to tell how a person is feeling. We already know how people feel when they're are around because of their moods and their facial expressions. I guess it can be a good thing to use for the people that are not good with facial expressions, they can use this technology to be able to understand how a person is feeling.",1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"I think that driverless cars would be useless, the reason that I think this is because ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldnt drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" Most people( mostly teenagers) like to go joyriding with there friends or just drive around town to blow off some steam.

Another reason that I believe that driverless cars are a bad idea is because what is the user of the car falls asleep and doesnt awaken whenever the car alerts them that they need to take over in a potentially dangoures situation. ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

This means the driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when there is a possibly dangours situation. These necessitates of the the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs.""

Another reason is that these vehicals could be extermly costly for the consumer's. All the technology that will be needed to be placed into this car will be costly not only for the company but will also be for the customers. There are also many problems with these cars considering that we do not have all the tech needed for them, Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved.

In conclusion I believe that driverless cars should not be mass produced.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Due to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, scientist are speculating the idea of giving computers a new technology called 'The Facial Acion Coding System' which enables computers to identify human emotions. This new system could be very valuable for students.

Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for advanced science at the University of Illinos, is working in collaberation with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Ansterdam to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. After the process of constructing a 3-D computer model of the face is done by the two , Dr.Huang then relies on the work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman, creatorr of FACS (facial Action Coding

System).

""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disqust, fear, and sadness- and hen associated each with characteristic movements of he facial muscles"" (D'Alto , paragraph 3)

With this , computers are able to recognize these emotions and give each emotion a percentage to show how you are truly feeling. This could not only be great for communication with your computer but help any person express how they feel. This can help professors as well get a better understanding of how a student may be feeling at given time, which could excuse them or help in any way they could for the students benefit. Lots of people struggle to describe every facial trait that coveys every emotion and with this technology that shows you just that from just identifying facial mucsles, more people around you and even YOURSELF can begin to have a clearer understanding of how you are truly feeling in that point in time.

This is important for any person who may be going through a rough time and needs clarity to how they are feeing. In the future this could benefit so many people. Being able to have communication with your computer can also make the individual using the system feel more safe and understanding.

Although people dont enjoy those annoying ads that their computer may send out to them, imagine being able to have your computer recognize when you smile at an ad or ""pop up"" so you see a similar ad follow that one or if you dont like an ad so you frown, you then begin to see ads that have no relation to that last one. This could be extremely valuable to the PC you are on or any computer or device you choose to use this system on.

""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang ""So computers need to understand that, too."" (D'Alto paragraph 6)

With this, in this being very beneficial for any student, this could very much improve any computer as well. This technology could make computer- animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery. Anything can be improved by this expression and emotion detector.

If this sytem benefited in more than just the individual using it but also the computer or device being used for it, more things would begin to improve helping all citizens that even may not be using the system to their benefit.

In conclusion this system would be a great addition to add along to today's newest technology programs. Lots of people could be benefited from this and it could help improve lots of technology worldwide. More people could begin to learn more about themselves and start communicating with their computer by having their computer give them their emotions each day they logged. With this system it has the ablity to make users of any device of technology enjoy their experience more so than they would before, with everyone's help this new Facial Action Coding System could make a huge change in today's society.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Smart cars are said to be the car of the future. They are said to be ""a driverless taxi"" but will they be as afficiant and great they are planned out to be?

These cars are going to be made by the Google company and they have been wanting to produce these cars before the year 2000. They did not have the technology needed such as sensors, computers, and mapping. They soon knew it would be impossible until their need were met, developed and built. They say they would need so many cameras and sensors to make this dream car come alive.

I do not think I am for this car creation. Yes it would be great to not have to drive but what if you had this amazing car driving itself and you were so tired you just happen to fall asleep and there was an accident you were unaware of and you were going right toward it, how would you know it was there? How would the car get around it? The positives about this car is that you don't have to do much. It will have its many cameras and sensors to know where it is going.

What if you are in your magnificant car and it is driving on its own and a little kid runs out in the road, what happens then? All the negatives about this dream car are system malfunctions and the fact that you still need a driver to watch the roads. So, you can't relax; you have to assist the car. What's the point of driverless car if you still need a driver to assist it? BMW added new technology were your car will drive up to 25 mph, but you have to have a driver to activate the touch sensors. Yes, they will steer, speed up, and slow down on its own, but having a driver watching everything is still necessary. If the technology fails while you're in you fabulous car resulting in an acciednt, who is responsible? You or the manufacturer?

All in all, I do not believe I am for the future ""driverless"" smart car because you still need to watch the roads as you normally would and if the technology fails, I would not want to be sued or injured. Would you be for the so called ""driverless"" Google car?",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,2,1
"After reading the passage and thinking about some other opinions of my own, I do not think it is a good idea to have driverless cars. My number one problem with driverless cars would be safety. In section nine of the prompt it clearly states ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" If driverless cars were used i feel that there would be multiple more car wrecks then there are now.

If people had a driverless car what is to keep them form thinking "" I don't have to pay attention, the car will do all the work for me."" in section ten it says ""Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" Knowing some people they might forget about the other 10 percent and not pay attention to what is happening on the road which could lead to wrecks. If they were, infact going to make a driverless car I would agree with putting in some flashing lights on the windshield of the car to get the drivers attention. Unless the driver had epalepsy, then it wouldn't be a good idea.

Though there are some positive aspects to having a driverless car. For example, in section eight of the prompt it states ""Such desplays can be turned off instantly when the dirver needs to take over-- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" This is good so that drivers will pay attention to aviod geting in a car wreck, but whaty happens when the driver doesn't look up fast enough or just thinks that their phone died and doesn't know to look up. What happens then? In conclusion, I do not believe that having a driverless car is a good idea for more than one reason.",2,4,3,3,1,2,1,2,2
"Driving can be a danerous thing in the wrong hands. Technology in general can be dangerous in the wrong hands. In the artical ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it gives two aspects of driverless cars/ vehicals. They give the negative, and the positive aspect on this subject. Technology is advancing. nd as the years go by they just get better. The more practice the more the technology can get better. They state both positive and negative aspects of the driverless cars. And they both

give good responses and give great evidence to support their views, but with technology evolving, my postion would be to alow the driverless cars.

In the artical ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" they talk about all of the positives of having and allowing driverless cars. And they state that technology we used today is not new and we have been using them for yeras. ""Sensors are nothing new, of course,"" they are saying that they have been advancing the sensor for years, so what make people think that they can not evolve the driverless cars? ""Within 10 yeras, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers,"" So this statement from the artical proves that these technologies are helping us, they are helping the peopel from dangerous stituation like car accidents, and even death. The technolgy being created today are being transformed into a saver way of life. So many people die from reckless driving, but with the driverless cars that they are trying to advance, can help us get into less accidents, and help us safer people.

""Founder of the Google Car project, believes that the technology had finally begun to catch up to the dream,"" which means that our driverless cars are coming, ironic to say this is the title of the artical which is ""Driverless Cars Are Coming."" throughout the years people have been improving little things like vibrated seats, cameras, and lights, to get to the even bigger picture, which is the driverless cars. If they can improve on little things, and make them great, i think that they can start to allow driverless cars to be tested and driven around.

Yes there is still not a technically driverless car that drives itself, the driverles car had human assitance, but that can always be improved. Nothing is impossible, when their making semidriverless cars and having sensors, etc.

So many people have accidents and sometimes die from driving, and not having their eyes on the road. the most common now adays are the texting and drving. If we proceed with the driverless cars, you would not have to worry about texting and driving, looking away from the road, and having accidents.

If this driverless cars come along, and people crash and it was not the cars fault or the manufactures fault, but the owner of the car, and does not want to admit it, like if they did not give the car fuel or something, but it was not the cars fault. People would audamaticly put the driverless car to shame. They would blame it on the car, and many people would have many agruements. People aways same themselves over something else. But in my opionion, if people just stay responsible that will never happen.

Tesla has prjected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that drive themsleves by 2020."" This means that they plan to be done with all their test and have driverless cars on the road in 2020. ""We grow closer to the destination everyday."" this mean that with all the advancements with technology the driverless cars are truely coming. And they truely should. I think once they come people will accept them.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"What is the point of driving a car now and days anyways? In VAUBAN, Germany even soccer moms gave up their car. Paris even bans car driving Due the smog. In BOGOTA, Colombia has a program that they wants to go worldwide. Let talk about Vauban, Germany you can't park on the street, in your own driveway nor your home garages are forbidden. Vanban is completely ""Car Free"". At first I really thought that was a joke but its not. Downtown they are allowed to have car ownership. What sense does that make. If the car owner buys a space for $40,000, and plus the new home. 70 precent of Vauban familes do not own cars. But 57 percent sold their car to move to Vauban. Vanban completed in 2006. 5,500 residents in Vauban. Think about it most people in Vauban dont have cars. Now lets get on to Paris... Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday's motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars home or pay a fine of $31 dollars, same thing goes for the odd numbered plates. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people  had their car inpounded for the reaction to how much the fine was. Car traffic was down too 60% . 5 days after intensifying the smog.

"Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. Not having to drive 24/7 would be nice, but at what price? Vehicles are not exactly the most reliable resource.

While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. They will go about thinking that the technology has everything under control. Forgetting that cars that require drivers have difficulties. Yet they will trust a car to drive itself and have no problem? The car you are driving could have miscalculations and make a turn where there is a building!

When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert.

Everyone has their own opinions, everyone has their own brain that allowes them to make the wrong or the right decission based on what they believe. Will you allow yourself to fall victim to awe or amazement and wonder at these new inventions. Or will you go over teh pro's and cons of becoming too reliant on the driverless vehicle and less aware of your actions while on the road?",2,3,0,2,1,1,1,2,2
"I think driveless cars should be developed. These cars can take the driving out of driving. They can prevent accidents before they begin. As stated by the article, ""Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This shows that even with half a million miles driven, the car is still safe.

First, these cars prevent accidents before they happen. Once they are more developed you could sleep in your car while it travels down the rode. The article states, ""It uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" This technology can warn you when there is danger and keep you safe.

Next, the driver can be interertained while waiting on their turn to drive. These companies are thinking of ""Bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The article also states that ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" This will keep the drivers entertained and safety a ""big concern.""

However, these cars cannot be driven without a human just yet. They cannot pull in or back out of a driveway. But there are many advances in technology happening today. ""Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020."" These advancements aren't too far away.

I think these cars should be developed. The advancements are underway and should be here by 2020. These cars can entertain you, keep you safe, and save you money on gas. Once they are driverless you can also sleep in them. I hope these cars are developed because I want one of my own.",2,4,3,3,1,1,2,1,2
"In the booming world today, transportaion is essential. Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think. But even if you drive a smart car or hybrid, emissions from these cars still affect the world around us. Lowered car use would help this improve. Using less cars would also have more benefits for all of us.

People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be ""Happier without them."" Lowering the use of cars would also prevent so much smog in the air. In Paris, France, the warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. in order to reduce the amount of smog in the air, on monday drivers with even-numbered liscense plates had to leave their cars at home or face a $31 fine. Then on tuesday, motorists with odd numbered lisence plates had to do the same. This led to decreases in the amount of smog in the air. The warm days and cold night would trap the smog in the air. Another instance is in Bogota, Comlubia, where there was a car-free day. According to buisnessman Carlos Arturo Plaze, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and to lower the air pollution."" This has led to newer sidewalks being paved, and new restraunts and upscale shopping districts to pop up all over the city.

Less cars mean less greenhouse gas emissions, which inturn help our environment. It also leads to less stress and deaths among the people in the city. Less cars are the future of our world, and its not too late to start to help our environment and to help better ourselves.",2,3,3,2,0,1,1,2,1
"The author uses and explains many ways how to explore and how we can improve our knowledge on the environment and conditions on Venus.

He supports each idea in it's own paragraph and giving several options on how to travel and land on Venus. He informs on the dangers of Venus and how we can work around it and focus on ideas on how we can land on Venus. The author states that why hasn't a spaceship touched down on Venus surface in more than three decades. Is it about the temperature or have we not studied enough about the planet Venus?

In the introduction of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author opens up giving Venus the nickname ""Evening Star"", but then informing the readers that the nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet, not a star.

The author supports the idea of the pursuit to Venus by giving the readers more information on Venus and what it is like.

For example, the author states that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

Earth and Venus have similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. In paragraph four, he states that venus might of been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system a very time long ago.

The author then informs us, the readers, that NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to Venus to study.

So the idea is that Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray of the planet. The author compares on how the scientists would do it to jet airplanes.

Traveling at a higher altitude to fly over storms. Doing so, the conditions would not be easy, but survivable. In the text, the author gives the conditions of Venus, such as the atomsphere. It's about ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide that covers all of Venus.

So it would be tough to see ground conditions. In addition, without being able to set foot on the ground, scientists would not be able to get samples of rock or gas to study and observe.

The author supports the idea of studying and if it's possible to travel and succeeding to Venus in many different ways.

In the article, he gives off examples on both ways. On if it's worthy to go to Venus and what the dangers are if running into them.

The author gives an idea on mechanical computers. Instead of using modern computer, mechanical computers can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces on Venus. One of the dangers he stated in the text was about Venusian geology.

He talked about the additional impediments such as erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lighting that strikes on the surface.

In conclusion, the author does support the idea of studying Venus and if it's a worthy pursit despiting the dangers Venus has. He compares and contrasts the ideas of Venus. In addition, giving off many informative facts about Venus and it's conditions it has. In the last paragraph of text, the author thinks that human curiosity will lead us into futher investigation on Venus and many other endeavors. He thinks that we shouldn't be limited to the dangers and doubts we have ,but the imagination and innovation we all have. The final paragraph brings it all together and saying that we will one day set foot on Venus.",3,3,4,3,1,2,1,1,1
"The Electoral College consists of more cons than pros. The systems that the unprogrammed engineers work on are complicated vast perspectives. When a president gets elected the most voters and does not recieve presidency, wouldn't that confuse you. Popular voting is an effective way to give a candidate presidency simply because the people want that candidate to be the one responsible for the United States. The Electoral College needs to change the way it picks its president. Otherwise, the U.S. would be vulnerable to a president that most people completely denied for the other candidate.

The thing with popular voting is that people can get the president they want. When the elections are based on which candidate has the most popular votes, there are no crazy tricks or a hidden trump card. All you have is a candidate that deserves to be the president of the United States. A good example is Al Gore and his presidency crisis. Most voters looked up to him as president. It was only until the quirks of the electoral college stole his opportunity of becoming president thanks to the system of the electoral college we have today. The situation that makes this crisis even worse is how the voters for the actual electors themselves cannot control whether they win the election or lose. This means that if we keep the routine of the electoral college we have now, there are many opportunities for an unwanted elector. Therefore, leading to an unwanted president.

Ever since 2000, many people have been suffering from economics and industry. This is the simple result of a bad electoral college system. The people of course should have most of the perks in picking a president. If the president is bad at his job in making the U.S. habitable, then the electors are to blame for making a huge mistake. Many doors are opened to sudden changes and confusing decisions. John F. Kennedy could've lost his position since all of the votes didn't necessarily go to him. There's a valid reason why people vote for a candidate. To pick the president they know suits them best.

I will admit to this though. Popular voting is not the accurate way to go through with. I mean there are situations where people just pick a president because he looks proffesional. Others are simply racist and go for the white candidate or even vise-versa. Popular voting is not perfect in the sense of the psychological opinions of the voters themselves. Besides, all of the people living in american soil are different minded. There is literally no way to immediately recognize who the voter is and why his reasons for voting are wrong. There is also nothing we can do since people are allowed to vote for whatever reasons they want.

Due to all of the information given to me about Al Gore and unwanted electors, it is the best solution to change the system to popular voting. Both sides of the arguments have strong reasons to either keep their system or change the way the electoral college is run. Meanwhile, lets be honest. There have been more political downfalls with the system we have now that can be fixed with popular voting. Even though there are people that vote for selfish and unreliable reasons, there is still a balance of the people who want this president and the people who don't. The U.S. is consisted of minds that think completely different in the sense of human nature. We don't live in a utopia where everyone agrees with eachother. Now, being able to let the U.S. decide who they want their president to be, it sounds like a pretty fair way to elect a new president, don't you think?",3,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Limiting car use could be a good thing, or producing greener cars that find an alternitive fuel rather than burning fossil fuels. The american society is built around cars, and as cars have only been around for a hundred years. we have not been interested in changing what they run on. Maybe we could find a cleaner burning fuel source so that we dont have to cut cars completly out of our lifes. Alternative means like electric cars and cars that run on solar power are out there we are just not mass producing them. the cars that are out and that run on an alternative means of fuel are to expensive for the avarage american. Oil companies dont want to see this switch happen to cars that run on alterniatve fuel because then that cuts into their budget.

There are cities that have cut cars out of their society completly, like vauban germany. were they are almost completly car free. You can still own a car there you just have to pay 40,000 for a parking space, which deters most people from owning a car. 70 percent of the population in vauban do not own cars as a result. Making the air in their city alot cleaner than their neighbors. Cities like paris and beijing china have some of the worst polution records than any other city in the world. Paris got so bad that they had to inforce a driving ban just to let it clear up. Cities like these have alot of residents which means they have alot of cars. Offering free transportation on some days might intise peple to leave their car at home and help lession the rate of polution that is given off.

Their are alternatives for now like car pooling and public transportation, but as the population keeps growing we are going to have to find another means of getting around greener. Once plug in and hybrid cars become cheaper there will be more of them found on the road, but for now we can try and cut back on our car use to help the enviorment. as more places become more populated the polution is only going to increase. In america however the main source of polution is not coming from cars it is coming from factories. which burn fossil fuels and blow them right up into the atmosphere. so we need to not just focus on cars we need to also focus on factories and trying to find an alterntive fuel that can power them.

We cant just cut cars out of our life but maybe we can cut back our use of them in our society, just so we can leave a better world for genorations to come. Alternative fuel is the answer we just have to start producing cleaner burning cars and more effiecent factories.",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,2,1
"Exploring The V!

Have you wondered what it would be like to land on a planet that is very dangerous to the human life?

Theres a Planet called venus and its very dangous to explore because of all the diffrent planet fetures that planet earth doesn't have. Venus is very dangerous to human life because of its tempatures, It's amospheres, and the surface of the planet.

Venus is a planet that human life can never set foot on because if its tempatures. In Paragraph 3 Line #3 the author says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". The human life form couldn't handle that much heat. In Paragraph 3 Line #7 the author states "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth"". None of are planets in are solar system have the kinda heat as venus does.

Venuses atmostphere is really dangerous to humans. In Paragraph 3 Line #4 the sentence contiuses and says ""And the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The atmoshereic presure is really strong on venus as well. In Paragraph 3 Line #8 the author says Such an evironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"". This planet is pernounsed as the hardest planet to study.

The surface of venus is rough. In Paragraph 3 Line #11 the author says ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". Venus is really like earth, but has alot of diffrences as well. In paragraph 4 Line #4 the author says "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coad have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth"". Venus could have had other forms of life in are solar system, But we will never know.

Venus is a hard planet to study and exam. (NASA) is trying to find new ways so we can get astronots on the none life planet. They have tried to land on venus with some rowbots but the tempature is to high and melted the metal of all of the robots.

"While many conspiracy theorists would have you to believe that the Face is alien artifact, it is actually just a natural land formation. The Face is nothing more than just another Martian mesa. These Martian mesas are actually common around Cydonia the only difference in the Face is the unusal shadows.

NASA would have no reason to try and cover up any evidence proving there was an acient civilization on Mars. If the Face truly was an acient alien artifact, the news of this discovery would actually benfit NASA and might help them get a bigger budget. Why wouldn't NASA tell the public about such an amazing discovery that might truly benifit them?

NASA even spent a lot of hard work and money to pass over the Face and prove to the public that this was nothing more than a natural landform.

Many scientist have proven time and time again that the Face is just a simple butte or mesa, which are actually common landforms around the American West. Detailed photos were even taken that prove this fact, the so called Face is a simple Martian mesa.

Even though many people including myself would like to believe this an acient alien artifact, there are just too many facts proving this theory wrong. From the detailed photos to the words of many scientists this theroy is simply wrong, and it's time the public expects the facts. The so called Face is not an alien artifact but mearly a simple Martian mesa.",2,4,1,3,1,2,1,2,2
"My fellow citizens we want people to limiting car usage or get raid of problems with cars for couple of reason. First reason is people rather walk instead of dealing with cars because of getting your excrise. Second reason is pollution. Last reason is making greenhouse gas. All this is solution to our problems in life. We will like to take care the people and the Earth to keep it in shape and clean.

Some people think it more relaxing to not deal with cars they instead they walk like the people in Vauban, Germany residents from there have given up their cars. In the streets of Vauban are completely ''car-free'' and street parking, driveways and home garages are forbidden in Freiburg. 70% of Vauban's families do not ow cars and 57% sold a car to move over there. at this new approach sores are paced a walk away on a main street rather than in malls along some distant highway.

Pollution is one of the most problem that we have and want people to limiting car usage. Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Mororists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave cars at home or suffer a 2 22-euro fine $31 same applyed to odd-numbered plates in diffent day of the week. Almost 4000 were fined. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world. Diesel fuel was blamed from France. Diesel make up 67% of vehicles in France, 53.3 % average of diesel engines in the rest of Westen Europe. We are trying to put greenhouse gas out in the world to make it less polluted in the world.

We are trying to make the wrold a better cleaner places for our future.",2,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Limiting car usage can be very benifical in many ways such as , enviromental , finantialy , economicly.

Car usage plays a big roll in todays society. People use there vehicles everyday to get around . But if we change that the whole world could beneifit from it . The author says "" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of america's emissions , just behind power plants"". Which means by cutting all these greenhouse gases down we could be saving the planet and creating a better world for the generations to come .

Rush hour would never be a problem again if cars where not an opotion anymore. The evidence says that "" President obama's ambitious goals to curb the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, enveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior : recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by "". This can result in good out comes for people all across the world.

In conclusion , by everybody stepping up and making a change in the way we use transportation the world could turn out to be a better place to live in health and economic whise . By limiting car usage our country and transportation can evolve as we know it .",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Have you Ever wanted to round up the cattle or take a daring job as a seagoing cowboy? My reasons are that a seagoing cowboy is hardworking, bone breaking and strong personthis is what luke faced In the text ""A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves"" By Peggy Reif Miller

First why do was a seagoing cowbiy is becuase that he was a heardworking cowboy Don his best friend was the one who Invited him to to go on a cattel boat in Europe. And luke just couldn't say no. At that time many contries were left in the ruins. so he sined up for a seagoing cowboy so it was his best friend Don that made his dream come true

Second why they chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that it is a bone breaking job.So they joined this program becuse they could help the contries that were left in the ruins. This is one reason why people shold perticapate in the UNRRA, And people should join the UNRRA becuase People could help the earth be a better place by giving the people food, or milk a dairy cow.

last why he chose to be a seagoing cowboy is that he is strong I think luke's claim is that this is not an easy task Becuse you will get hurt. The text states"" a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlanic"" This shows that you might be left with a few broken bones, Just a few right?

This shows that this job can be a bone breaking expience. Now you know what a seagoing cowboy is a hardworking, bone breaking, strong kind of a man.",2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The using of of this new technology called the Facial Action Coding Systems should be used to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This technology can help many students in need without having to ask the teacher or professor for help. The students wont need to feel ashamed about asking a questionfor help because with this technology it'll make things more clearly for you to understand.

In the text it states it explains to you how this new technology can scan your facial recognitions and can tell how you're feeling. First the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of your face and all 44 major muscles in the modele must move like human muscles. In the text it states, ""Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are happines, surprise,anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" All these emotions are associated with the characteristics movements of your facial muscles. Some examples he talks about is when you're surprised your frontalis pars lateralis muscle above your eyes are raised; another one is when your orbicularis oris, around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger. This software can identify misex emotions and each expresion is compared to a neutral face that shows no emotion.

This new technology advancement would be able to recognize one's emotions but we can't always rely on technology. For instance we don't need technology to know when a friend is sad but we can just recongize their expresions by simply looking t their face. This technology can also be misleadng, In the text it states, ""A classroom computer could recgnize when a student is becomine confusef or bored..Then it culd modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor."" Yes this technology can read facial expressions but can they truly understand why we are feeling this way or whats going on through our head. We can be in class learning a lesson but you can be confused about not what you're learning but of something else that's going across your head. Like any other technology. this new technology can work both ways a student it can either help them or bring them down.

Much of the human communication is nonverbal which includes emotional communications, so computers need to understand that too. This technology is basically based upon the muscular action units one gives away. In the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a geneuine smile and a forced one. In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sude ways using the zygomatic major and and a different muscle, the risorius."" They say faces don't lie, so this technology would be able to read even the fake smile you put on.

The Facial Action Coding System may help the students in many different ways. It can help them with a lesson that they don't quite understand or confused about. It can recognize if youre truly happy or faking or any oter emotions you may be feeling. Yes you know how you are felling but this technology can help give you the confidence you need. This system shows how it can improve one's life by it understanding your facial muscles that give away your expressions. You won't be ashamed to ask questions nor be laughed at because this technology will help you without you realizing it. While you're confused on the lesson this technology would modify the lesson like an effective human instructor so you'll understand the lesson mre.",3,2,3,2,0,1,1,2,0

""Well you get to help out Europe and China by giving them horses, baby cows, goats and so on."", Luke said, ""You also get to see so many natural wonders, antiques, buildings from long long ago, and meet so many new and great people""

""Sounds fun but what about my kids and wife,they will miss me, and who will be man of the house after all I only have two girls with a mother that is sick. I'm sorry Luke I just can't go to many things to worry about"".

In the meantime Luke called Dr. Philipe, (phil-EY-pay) called Saul, Paul's brother, asked if he could house sit for Paul, and payed for the docter visit and Saul's trip.

""So Paul, now can you go?"", Luke said

""Yes I can go"", said Paul

On the way to the Luke's barn that was on a hil next to the lake, they found multiple holes in the ground that hadn't been there before. ""I wonder where these came from?""

""Me too, maybe a giant worm or a mole"", Paul said

""Let's follow the holes to see where the main source is"". They followed the holes and it led them to the barn. They heard a lot of noise from the horses then the cows and then the chickens. ""What's going on in here"", Luke said. ALmost right after he said that he spotted a cottenmouth snake on of the most deadliest snakes of all, besides the viper.

""Oh my chicken nuggets, it's a snake"", Paul screamed. The snake heard Paul scream and turned around to face Paul. The sake bunched up and Luke said, ""Run!"" Paul was to late. The snake bit him on his ankle and Paul fell to the floor. Luke grabbed an iron horse shoe and threw it at the snake, missed the first time, but the second hit the snake in the head.

""Get away from my friend!"" Yelled Luke, ""Or I'll through another one!"" The snake just stayed there hissing at Luke. Luke threw another one and hit the snake again and killed the snake. Luke threw the dead snake out of the barn and got all the venom out of Paul.

""Lets go now"", Luke said. They left and was on the boat untill one of the horses saw a spider and ran towrds land. ""Let's just leave it after all we have 337 horses"", said Paul.

They left and was having the time of their lifes, seeing all type of sea creatures and weird fish. They made it to Europe and delived the animals safe and sound.

""So did you have fun?"" asked Luke.

""Yes, it is fun to get out of the house and two screaming girls and enjoy life while we still can"", said Paul

"What is the square root of 100,012? You might not know, but your computer does. Infact your computer knows a lot, but one thing it doesnt know is how to detect feelings. Why is there a camera on your computer? Who knows? Lets put that camera to use! As we know computers tend to be used more often. I agree with the idea of allowing computers to identify what mood the user is in and adjusting accordingly. I agree with this because technology is advancing, normal computers can't compete with this upgrade, and computer ads tend to be annoying.

Mona Lisa, the subject of a wonderful painting. A painting which appears she is smiling in. Smiling as if she is happy? How can we be sure that she is happy? Is it as simple as looking at the picture? In paragraph 4 is tells us that ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements"". How can a camera identify how a person is feeling? Simple, technology is improving and computers are being updated.

Computers truly are fascinating, but as asked in Paragraph 2 ""Can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"". These new computers can detect movement of one or more muscles in the face. The computer will then categorize the movement into one of these 6 categories happiness,suprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness. But then ""Boom"" and ad pops up, arent ads just annoying.

Ads, ads, ads all on the screen. How could you get rid of irrelevant ads? Well with this new software your compter will be able to detect is you are satified with your ads or not. If you appear happy when an ad pops up, your computer will discontinue to show the ad and replace it with another one. If a satisfying look appears on your face after and ad appears, your computer will continue to show ads that satisfy the user.",1,3,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"I believe that we should leave the world of driverless cars alone. I think there will be too many problems with the cars in the future. For example, what if there's a glitch or other problem with the car while someone is driving the car and injures somebody. Whose at fault for the accident?

If we move forward in the process of creating driverless cars it's going to cost a lot of money for the project. They would have to come up with the money to buy the car, the cameras, the computers, the GPS, etc. It would cost a ton of money. Not to mention all the labor costs, and what about the roads? They would have to find a way for the car to drive on the road. Doing anything to the roads would be bad enough. How much money do people want to spend just trying to make a car that drives itself. We would spend all that money and then the car would have too many problems.

Roads are being made and taken up all the time. to make this car they would have to find a way to make the roads to where the car could drive on them and then find a way for the car to recognize where those roads are. What are they going to use so the car can find the correct roads that are safe to drive on? That is definetly something that they would need to figure out.

Another problem is what are they going to do with all the other peoples' cars that don't drive themselves after they do all this work just to make a driverless car? Are the roads still going to be able to be driven on by old cars that aren't driverless? I think that there are too many questions that need to be answered before we even consider making a car that drives itself.

If we do create a completely driverless car, how much will it cost? They would've spent propably thousands if not millions on the car, so how much would it cost? If they make the car, I think it would be one of those things where only certain people could get it because it would cost so much. Just for them to break even on the car they would propably have to sell it for a ton of money.

I believe that we should not move forward in the project to build a driverless car. There are too many quesions that need to be answered. They would have to find many different way for the car to work, like the roads, GPS's, the computers in the cars. There is to many things for them to work out. I don't think the world is ready yet for driverless cars. Maybe in the next fifty to a hundered years or so, but not yet. The world just isn't ready for it yet in my opinion.",3,3,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"What would the world be like if we could just type in your wanted destination and just go withoug needing a driver, how would the world react for such a thing?

Could the car just think on it's own? How would everything even work on the car?

In my opinion, we shouldn't have driverless cars untill we can get them to be fully driverless without taking away so many taxi jobs, wrecks, and confusion during them wrecks.

I don't think that we should have driverless cars, because taxi companies would loose all their emploies, it would save the company money but, also what about that families? How are they going to get their next meal on the table without a job? Driverless cares would leave people hungry and jobless, then their kids would be taken by DCS and them the ' family ' would be seperated. Meaning driverless cars are bad for the people because it can cause poverty among the people.

Also, driverless cars could cause many wrecks by not having exact measurment of when to stop. And much of the driving laws include a person to be driving. How would the car get it's licentce ? Would it have a liceence? When driving you use your brain a car doesnt have a brain aso it wouldn't work out for them. In other words, you need a person , a driver, still to have a driverless car ; so would it really be considered a driverless car? No.

Then, theres the part when they do get into a wreck, who's fault would it be because there isn't a driver to blame? who do they sue? how wouold insurence be on a driverless care?

The company who manerfaactured the car would be the one to blame because they should have prepared for the situation, also they would be the ones the be sued. It's just a bad idea all together because the company will go bankruped.

So, think again, how would the world be if there was a such thing as driverless cars? would it be good or would it be bad? we already know that its gonna be a bad idea so why am i even asking you ? It's bad because iit takes jobs from hardworking drivers, causes wreacks, and confustion. So, driverless cars for all is a NO GO.",2,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,0
"The planets are a fasinating part of science. They have charateristics that we can not even imagine and facts that we long to learn about. The mask that apeared on Mars was first spotted in the year of 1976. I can strongly say that the face on Mars is not created by aliens. I know this because scientists figured that is was a butte or mesa- landforms that are common around the American West. Also when they shot the pictures it was taken during winter when it is normanly cloudly, not a good time to take a photo.

The face on Mars is not a alien creation, but is a Marian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. This implies that the science behind this, is that the landform on Mars is non other than a mesa. Scientist also know that mesa landforms are common enough, especially around Cydonia. This shows that the unusual formation was definatly a butte, but this one just happened to make it look like a face.

In 1976 a Viking shot a photo of a face like portrait. This was taken during winter a cloudy time of the year. This demonstrates that this picture is not the most reliable photograph. And so On April 5, 1998 a team of MOC researchers went out a took a sharper photo,much more reliable thean the original Vikings photo. This reveils that the landform was very much a natural landform. Though this rock formation did very much resemble a human head, We know that this mesa was created by shadows not aliens.

The face on Mars show us that things may appear different from what they seem. Next time lets just leave it to the experts to tell us the science behind things.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,2,0
"This article is mainly shown to inform readers just how useful exploring Venus can be. The author is quite enthusiastic about this topic and is eager to offer his/her insight on the subject. The author believes that getting a chance to explore Venus is a great benefit, because previous studies have led to scientists speculating that Venus was probably at one point in time just like Earth. Meaning that it probably was suitable for life or once had life, however it is unlike;y that it has any forms of life now.

Venus has too harsh of conditions to be able to support anything. High atmoshperic pressure, High concentration of sulfuric acid in the air, Intense heat all of these factors go into reasoning as to why it is not a good idea to go there unprepared especially when NASA is still working on ways to do so, or maybe they have ( I don't know i haven,t been updated on a topic) anyway even though it is proven to be dangerous it is not impossible.

"There have two sides to using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. Eckman has classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new emotion-recognition software tracks thewe facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Moving your facial musclles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. In fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. It's all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one. If using this technology to read, the people won't influence their negative feelings, and can manipulate the degree entirely. Each expression is compared against a neutral face. But the computer can't influence clearly the feelings because they have some feelings and emotionals are so hard to illustrate. And if not using that, the people can show their real emotion on their faces, to an expert, faces don't lie, these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""caculation"" everyday, you can tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on their faces. Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, surprise... A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive. So computers need to understand that, too. We unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author tells the reader about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents with their use of evidence and prior knowledge of previous studies to visit venus.

Venus is one of the closest planet to us. Although having the planet be so close, many dangers come with the surface of venus. The atmosphere alone holds 97% of carbon dioxide, along with corrosive sulfuric acid. On average, the tempurature can reach over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressue is 90 times greater than earths. The author illustrates that, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" With this infomation, they add that venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. And that's not all, venus also has erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes to probes going to land on its surface.

With all these negatives aspects of venus, why do we even bother to study venus further on? Astronomers are interested in venus because it may be the most earth-like planet in our solar system. Studies have shown that venus could have possibly been largely covered by oceans and various forms of life like earth. The authors adds that, ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" NASA has ideas to send scientists to Venus. One of their ideas include sending them to float above the surface at about 30 feet in a blimp like vehicle to aviod the dangerous grounds of venus. NASA also says that the air pressure is equivalent to the sea level on earth, so we already have the technology to avoid being crushed. NASA has also planned on using electronics made of silicon carbide that has been tested in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in its conditions. And lastly, they are looking into reusing older technology; envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II, because they are able to make calculations using gears and levers, and dont require electronics.

The challenge of exploring venus would be difficult and demanding, but with the technology we now have, we could be able to face these challenges and be able to further expand our studies of our solar system.",3,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2

"Self-Driving Cars are Amazing, But too Risky

I believe that self-driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Your car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self-driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self-driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in gps systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the maufacturer of the self-driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen? The idea seems great, but also scary.

"The driverless car is a great concept but I don't believe that our technology is prepared for it yet. There are too many things that could go wrong and that's if the government even lets these cars out on the road. It would be a really great idea, especially on longer trips like our family trip down to Florida every year for spring break. In reality I just can't see it being that safe and successful.

The writer talks a little bit about having special roads for these cars and this is just a concept of mere fiction. There is no way we can embed every single one of America's roads with an electrical cable, it's just not a possible thing to do. With America already in so much debt, I can't see how making these roads a reality would actually help the United States in any way.

Now we are going to scratch the smart road thing because we all know that it's ridiculous, and move on to a semi-possible option-smartcars. My first topic here is that machines always malfunction eventually. No matter how well the manufacturer makes them, they will always malfunction in some way or another. I'm sure these cars will cost a fortune, and with that cost no one will want to update them every three years. Not wanting to update these cars puts everyone at risk for malfunctions. Personally I know I'm bad about taking the time to update my phone, so I'd be really bad about updating my car. Whether that be the cars data recognition is worn out or the technology simply isn't up to date, malfunctions will happen.

When these malfunctions do happen, who is to blame? The car for not working properly or the person for not updating their car? Technically, it is the cars fault for not stopping and rearending another car, but a car can't pay for the damages. I could see a lot of law suits coming out from this, may it be between individuals in an accident or a customer verses a manufacturer. I think manufacturers should really do themselves a favor and say out of this technology advance. Accidents are already not fun we don't need to add another complicated measure to the process.

When I first read about the driverless car I thought it was a great idea, and not until I dug a little deeper into the concept did I realize that there are some things about a driverless car that our society isn't ready for. We don't have the money to help this idea be successful, nor do we have the mindsets of Americans to make it successful. I believe within my lifetime that it could be good to have driverless cars, but for now I can only look at it as a great idea with bad reprecussions.",3,3,1,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I believe that we should be able to have the popular vote, so we can be able to choose who we want as our leader and for the reasons that we want them to lead our country. When we vote we accpect that whoever got the popular vote should be our president we dont want the Electoral College to change and over power our voting. We want our right to vote to actually mean something and for us to make some decisions in our country and who should be the leader.

When we where given the right to vote and given some power to our popular vote we we were accpecting to be able to use that right to help descide what is best for our country. as it says in the article,

""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for president..."". What that means to me is that when we vote for our president we are just helping our electors have a better point in our sperspective. So when we vote we aren't really getting what we want we are just helping the electoral college get what they want. We should be the ones who are getting what we want we are the ones out there struggling and fighting for what we want. The Electoral College doesn't care about what we want and how we feel about the situation. If we were givven the right to be ablle to vote we accpect for that to happen so there really isn't any point in voting because we still have a chance in having our popular vote getting over ruled. That isn't fare to us to be given a right and it not being any power in our favor. This is the same reason why everyone doesn't vote is because they feel that there vote won't matter do to the Electoral College.

More importantly we have our right of freedom of speech from the Bill Of Rights. Also the Electoral College has 538 electors and they only need a majority of 270 electoral votes to elect our president. So that means the they get the popular vote as well as we do but the only difference is that they have more power than we do which isn't part of our rights. So that being said they dont care what we say either way its going to end up in a popular vote the will just have the final vote and that means they get what they want. Also as the article states in the second section that,

"" according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of votors would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."". That right there is saying that he won the votors popular vote bout because of the Electoral College he lost the presidency. So he won the part of the election but due to the people with more power he lost which is wrong and shouldnt be allowed. As I was saying the people that actually get effected by the election and the president should have the upper hand in power. Another quote from section three,

""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled..."". There is another reason that the the Electoral College should be excluded from the election of the president.

In conclusion as the citizens of the United States of America should have the say in who is our leader and how the election is decided. The Electoral College should be overruled by the citizens and have there power taken away from them. We the people that want the right president for our country should have the power. As our right to vote should be enforced and respected. Also we all should come together as a country and fight for what we believe is right and for what we deserve as a nation.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,2,1

I think teaching how to do this to students is a very good idea. Because if we teach this to students we can tell if a person is having a dad day and you can help them out or not. You could also tell if someone is happy or sad. You could tell if they are havin g a dad day and you could try and make them have a good day. You could tell if someone was having suicidle thoughts or is just joking. If you see someone that is happy you could try and keep them happy all day.

"Although the idea of driverless cars sounds fantastic, it seems a little too good to be true. I have faith in the engineers who will be designing the cars, but I have less faith in the people who will be in these self-driving cars.

As stated in the article ""the Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". That sounds easy enough, but what if the driver fell asleep? What if the driver had some kind of medical emergency and they fainted? What if the driver is paying too much attention to their phone to notice that there is an abstacle or accident ahead? What if? These are questions I don't want to answer from first hand experience. I do not trust other people to be responsible and ready to take action when the time comes for them to drive, perphaps in case of an emergency. At the same time, I do not want to put my life in the hands of a machine. Something could always malfunction.

When I think about future generations and how they might not have to learn how to drive, I get a little sentimental. Ever since cars have been around, its been a major milestone in a young peron's life to get their drivers license. Its a right of passage to becoming an adult. Getting your driver's license signals that you're independent. If self-driving cars really do become a thing of the future, getting a license might not be necessary, and young adults will no longer have this important right of passage.

Driving a car is a skill. Take NASCAR driving for example; its a sport based on skillful driving. Driving a car develops hand-eye coordination, quick reflexes, and problem solving abilities. If drivers make self-driving cars their main mode of transportation, they will no longer be developing these skills through driving. Driving your own car puts your life and others lives in your hands and forces you to think responsibily. Drivers will become careless and nonchalant about driving if they have driveless cars.

Who's to say that driverless cars are going to be revolutionary or fatal? The bottom line is that I'm putting my life into the hands of the car, and I only have one life. Why would I risk it?",2,3,1,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Many people today are accepting the idea of limiting car usage around the world. Though cars are an excellent way to get around they might not be the best for the enviorment. In a city in Germany, Vauban is home to many residents who do not own a car. In fact 70% do not have one and 57% sold a car to move there. These people aren't only seeing an environmental effect but also they seem more happy.

Pollution is also a problem when it comes to motor veichles. When Paris had a record day of pollution they decided to take action and inforced a partial driving ban. In just five days, congestion in France was down 60%. As you can see limiting car usage is already benefitting many and the more we turn to it the most likely we are to be living a more happy and safer life.

In places such as Bogota, Colombia there are days called car-free day. These days only buses and taxis are only allowed, so some people just bike, hike, or skate. The ultimate goal is to reduce smog and stress. Some Colombian cites are joining in on the event as well making this a growing imporvment campaign. This day has made many imporvments to the way of life, making the city look cleaner, cutting traffic time, and creating upscale shopping districts.

When it comes to America we can already see a decrease in car usage from 2005. If this number continues we will see beneficial environmental chages. Though the car industry will probably will be hit hard they already are discussing a plan to partner with telecommunications industry. They want to create safer public transportation and by doing so they would be saving time and conserving our resources.

There seems to be more advantages than disadvantages when it comes to limiting  car usage. I feel when everyone gets the idea that a safer and cleaner world is in the best intrest of everyone. then we will be taking the right steps to a new and better life.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Dear,Senator

I think we should in take concideration in the next few years about changing are election to popular vote. I feel that are state would benefit in a positive way with the way that popular vote is set up. looking at the  past history the electoral college is not benefiting us in a positive direction. i qutoe this from the article ""over 60 percent of voters would pefer a direct election""with that being said lets look at the cons of the electoral college.

To begin with the electoral college system the people like me dont get to vote for president i have to vote for someone else to vote for me in that i feel like my vote doesnt count because what happens if i vote for a elector and he doesnt go for my person to win. That just makes me feel dumb then if the elector does vote for the same person asme its not really even final becuase that vote doesnt go towards the president it goes toward the state elector and its basically there choice. another con in the electoral college system is that the same fiasco in 2000 will break out again. were the legislatures are responsible for picking electors and they dont take in to concideration of other people votes. the con that could mostly impact america is a tie in the electoral vote. another reason the electoral college is an stupid way to vote is that the big states get better privelges than the smaller states they out rule the smaller states. Its final the electoral college is unfair outdatedand irrational.

the only reasons the electoral college is alive now is the cetainty outcome,everystates president,swing states,runoff elections .run off electionsn means basically  there will never be a blow out in the voting polls it will always be compitive with that being said with the presidents trying to run for president the will actually try to reach the peoples needs to meet there satisfactory. the swing states is sayiong that there one state isnt going to decide the whole election.",2,3,1,1,0,0,0,1,0
"Hey, this is Luke Bomberger and I think that you should become a Seagoing Cowboy! When I was a small boy my friend Don invited me to go to Europe. When I couldn't think of a reason to say no I went with him. I'm glad I did because if I hadn't I wouldn't ever have become a Seagoing Cowboy. You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!

Instead of my service I became a Seagoing Cowboy and got animals across the sea safely. I washed them and cleaned them over and over but in all those chores I got to travel!

I got to see Europe, China, Greece, and Italy! I was a small town farm boy and then I got to see all of these places, all because I became a Seagoing Cowboy! You can become one too!

I'll admit that there are some dangers in becoming a Seagoing Cowboy. Once I almost fell overboard and broke my ribs! I wasn't able to do anything for the animals for a couple of days but they kept me company. Even though becoming a Seagoing Cowboy has its faults it overall is very exilerating and makes life an adventure! You can become a Seagoing Cowboy just like me!

If all that doesn't satisfy you, this will! When there are no animals aboard to take care of you can play games to pass the time. These games include baseball, volleyball, fencing, boxing, reading, and table tennis tournaments! When you are playing these games with all the other cowboys you tend to make cowboy friends almost immediatly! You can sign up right now to make new friends and play games with them!

All in all the Seagoing Cowboy experiance was the best experiance of my life. I hope that everyone gets the chance to have this experiance! You can have adventure to make you feel alive. You can have tourism to let you have experiance across the world. You can have games and new friends to keep you company and help you pass the time! You can have many things if you become a Seagoing Cowboy!",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,3,3
"The Electoral College is a ""process"" ""between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens"" (1). The Electoral Collage was created by the founding fathers and was written in the Constitution. The Electoral Collage should be kept instead of popular vote because the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who becomes President and it is chosen by a better educated person.

To start, the Electoral Collage helps in deciding who is gonna be the President.  ""Certainity of outcome, everyones President, swing states, big states, and avoid run-off elections"" (Posner). The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral Collage invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (18). ""This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (19). ""...the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election"" (20). ""So, other things being equal , a large state gets more attention from presidental candidates in a campaign than a small state does..."" (21). ""The Electoral Collage avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast"" (22).

Secondly, when voting for Electoral Collage ""you are actually voting for your candidate's electors"" (6). ""Each candidate running for President is your state has his or her own group of electors"" (5). ""The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" (5).

Although the Electoral Collage sounds simple, there are some problems that occur. ""...According to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral collage-- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (9). ""Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (10).

To conclude, the Electoral Collage is easier to decide who is becomes the President and it is chosen by a better educated person. ""Voters in a presidental elections are people who want to express a politcal preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election..."" (23).",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Electoral Congress

Have you ever wondered how the government adds up the votes and determinds who the president is after the election? the Electoral College is a process made in the Constitution, a compromise between the election by Congress and the election by citizens. Most would say that the Electoral College is reguarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic way of selecting a president. Like every other thing in the world, people form their own opinions. There are pros and cons to everything, even the Electoral College.

To begin with, the Electoral College is exactly what it sounds like. It is a group of highly educated people that come together every year during the presidental election and choose wisely who the want to become president and vice president. Once everyone is complete choosing who they select, they add them up and seperate them by each state. Keep in mind, each state only gets a certain number of electors, depending on how big the state is. For example, Florida, the state that I live in, gets 29 electoral votes, as to Hawii, which only gets four votes.

Next, the Electoral College has its pros and cons. One con of the College is they have more of an impact on the choosing of the president than the actual citizens have. You would think that the people, including both sides of the political parties, would have more of a say on whome becomes the president for the next four to eight years. For instance, multiple people and groups such as Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commence, And the AFL-CIO have said and agreed on, ""Abolishing the electoral college!"".

Lastly, we have many reasons why we keep the Electoral College. One reason is certainty of outcome, a president can have more citizen votes than the other, but the losing candidate can still win because of the electoral votes. Another reason this happens is because most states have a winner-take-all basis, meaning that the state chooses and the winning person with the most votes gets a state vote, even if you personally didn't vote for that person. Another reason why is because the U.S. has many larger states and the Electoral College balances it out for them.

So as you see, the Electoral College is debatable on whether or not it is a good or bad thing. They have pros and cons like everything else in the world.",1,2,1,2,0,1,1,0,1

"Venus is a very questionable topic because the heat , no sunlight and the amount of radiation and phisical thickness of heat in venus. In my opinion venus is very very dangerous to live on because its so hot and the amount of energy is not so good for humans and there health. Venus the following desribes how the autor feels about Venus and how i feel about venus .

Venus is very dangerous and questionable place that in my opinion the amout of heat could be very harmful to our skin the author thinks that its a good idea to live on venus well i beg to differ because people on earth already get sunburnt just from a little bit of sun at the beach. Or at a swimming pool .Just think of how many hospital visits venus would have .Hang on there isnt anything on venus but heat and radiation and dry air there isnt any hospitals .Well thats another concern there as well as the heat and radiation that are bad for humans .

The author suggests that humans should go to Venus because there might have been life on venus because its earths twin. Also he says ""If we could get more research about venus than we might have a strong possibility"". Also now days everone has a cell phone or some type of device thats electronic well it says in the pasage that ""Just imagine exposing a cell such as a phone or a tablet to acid or heat on venus capable of melting tin"". That there alone is a problem because kids teens adults act like they cant live without any celluar devices whenever a techer takes it from a student at school they argue throw temer tantrums yell scream etc. Just imagine going to venus and hearing all the complaining fromthose teens and kids and infants crying because they cant have there leap frog game or there tablet full of cool games and stuff on it .

All i'm trying to say is venus is not a good place because people get tired of summer and want to have winter or fall just something a lot cooler than the hottness all the time .There goes another complaint the phones and the heat wow I would get irratated after a while of complaining .

In conclusion, venus is going to be fun and exiting to most people until they are there all the time and think about all the heat resisting clothes and shoes headbands etc. We'll haft to wear 24/7 speaking of 24/7 is the time still the same will it be difficult for people on earth to find out and live on venus with the time change . All i'm trying to say is that there are some people who are going to agree then when they get there and feel the hotness and the radiation and see there phones, tablets, leap frogs , etc. all melt away in the heat and radiation 9 times out of 10 there going to want to go back to earth .

"Mr. Senator election by popular vote is the way to go, let the people decide!  It's their choice to pick who runs the U.S.A. this is the choice of who they want to run the country.  The citizens should have a right to vote for who they really want.  Instead of having a couple hundred people I think we should have all the people in the country choose.  So why dont we?  We can establish this rule and make it right let the citizens of the U.S.A. pick who the president should be!

Electoral collage  as the office of Federal Register in quote ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting og the electors where they vote for the President and Vice President"".  It's a bad idea to me when you can just make everyone vote for who they want not who just a couple hundred people want.  The Electoral College consists of 538 electors which a certain amount need to vote as 270 is the precise number is required.  Each candidate running each has a group of electors, they are originally chosen by the candidates politicial party.  The choice where the people choose and vote is way easier than that, we have a choice for what we want.

The ""Indefensible Electoral College"" is wrong your voting for the electors as it says in paragraph 10.  Bradford Plumer says as I quote ""Under the electoral college sysetem voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President.  There for we are voting for the electors right?  So whats the whole point when we can stick to our ways and vot ourselves.  This makes it way more simple and faster, better than waiting through the system for other people to vote, when you can just do it yourself.

Theres no reason for each party to select a slate of electors.  It can be argued that this system can turn off potential voters as a candidate.  There are 5 reasons for retaining this system.  Those are certainty of outcome, everyone's President, swing States, Big states, and avoid run-off elections.  Still we need to be able to make our own decisions.  We don't need other people to make them for us.

These people in the U.S.A. are determined in what they want, not what other people want.  They want to choose what they believe they don't want to go through a long system. When you can just do it yourself its easier, because you know what your doing but if you go the other way you have to teach the people your working with.  When you have the whole Country voting it makes it more simple and easy to go through the process.  So let the people choose who they really want as the President of the U.S.A. dont leave it to other people to do it for them.",3,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Why does this country even have this system? Where someone else basically chooses for you? The Electoral College should change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. This should change because the people have the right to have their opinion go to what is being voted on,not some else choice also because it's like people are voting for something they don't want foresfuly.  The United States is a what we call a democracy meaning the country is lead by the power of the people.

So when two people have an idea to make something better and another person has a different idea they each want to others to hear their ideas. Each person will have their reasons on why they think the way the way they think and the peolpe will have to make a desicion on what the they think is best for their community and their country. The United States is a democracy which means it is lead by the people. It's the people say. So when someone votes they expect their vote count against what they are going for. You making a desicion and someone else who is higher than you changes it makes voting ironic. Why vote? Just make them do the whole election. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president""(Plumer). So technacally we are not doing the voting we are just what is called ""giving options"" to those who are actually doing the voting. We the people demand to be heard and want what we want. In

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong it states that over sixty percent  of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Point being be should be heard no matter what.

In the United States we are not forced to do anything really. Especially when it comes to choosing. Everybody thinks differently so why should someone else vote for the choice of the people. It's like we are voting for someone we don't want when someone higher that you is voting for you. Each stae has their own number of electoral votes but it shouldn't be that way because it the president your voting for is in a tie and he need those votes the people would know that their votes are helping the person they want to see win. But when the electors choose something else the people cant think that. Sometime the electors refuse to vote for the their party's canidate. which makes the situation even terrible.

Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the sytem are wrong paragraph 11 it says ""Electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever the please."" So why even waste time on telling people to vote if someone else will choose for you sometimes not what you want.

In the end having to count so many votes could be dificult and when counting it could lead to mistakenly counted. But we the people make our own desion for our own good. Just imagine someone asks you what you want to eat and get you something totally different.",3,3,2,2,0,0,1,1,0

"Technology is accelerating at a very rapid pace! Just 30 years ago the computer was created, and now we're almost at the point of a car driving for you completly. Everyone has their own thoughts on this subject, some people might think it's interesting and some might feel skeptical and that we're creating a dissastor. How do you feel about a car that will drive for you?

Thinking about a car that could potentially drive for you sounds a bit scary. Looking at the statistics of automotive accidents, they would be sure to increase significantally due to the technology being new to everyone and them not being used to it, but also dysfunctions with the car itself. The new technology would be great, but only if when it's used it's very regulated such as having special tracks the cars drive on. If it gets regulated, companies who own tracks the cars are permitted to drive on could have insurance that if something happens they're fully covered. This would help with a lot of the law suits, and also a written contract should be signed stating that you agree with the terms of use.

In conclusion, driverless cars would be a nice thing to have but only if regulated and restricted on state roads. The way technology is expanding maybe one day a car will be invented that would be smart enough to drive on roads, but we haven't gotten to that point yet.

"Driverless Cars Are Coming

As everything in our society based on science and technology, cars are also developing from human control to driverless. The article on the left introduces how big companies (for instance, Google, BMW, etc.) are trying to make driverless cars come into our daily life and how the law will change if we have driverless cars commonly. Once driverless cars come into our life, people will argue that is it good to develop driverless cars or is it bad?

In my opinion, I have a positive aspects of driverless cars. The first and the most direct reason is because driverless cars can make our daily life much more convenient than before. We don't need to worry about which road are we driving on or any places we haven't been before. The car will drive for us, it will have plan for which road or direction we'll be.

The second reason is the driverless cars are safer than people driving by themselves. Sometimes people cannot drive safely when they are tired or get drunk. That can make a huge accident. But the driverless cars can help us to drive, ""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone"". (passage 5) By using the sensor in the car, we don't need to worry about safety anymore. The sensor can control the car and give us a much safer trip than ever before.

The third reason is driverless cars can reduce the quantity of accidents. When people are using the driverless cars, they ""must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a probelm occurs"". (passage 7) Although it is driverless car, drivers still need to pay attention.

Convenience, safety, reduction of accidents... These are the reasons we choose to use the driverless cars. There is a huge number of people who still have negative aspects of the driverless cars.

"Studying planets is often hard because of the conditions in space, and also on the planet Venus there are also very harsh conditions that humans cannot survive. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Exploring Venus can be a very risky planet for us to expore until we get better technology.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's twin because it is the closest planet to be like Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus would be hard to expore becuase of the planet's suface reaching up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of solar system and if we tried to land a rover there the metal would just liquify because of the extreme temperature's. NASA however, still wants to try to study the planet but they would have to hover over Venus because of the extreme conditions on the planet's surface. Even at 30 plus miles in the air in Venus the temperatures can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Rendering standard of photography and videography ineffective. The solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's level.

More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas,or anything else, from a distance. Threfore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow the machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.",0,2,2,3,1,2,2,2,2

"Mona Lisa was happy 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgust, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. this show us that somehow computer software can recognize our emotion. at the University of Illinois, working collaboration with prof andd University of Amesterdam are experts at developing better ways for humans and computer to communicate. in the article say ""computer reconginze the subtle facial movements we human use to express how we feel"".

Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman was working on processing to begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face, Eckman has classified that six basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. this is so true because when we have a lot of homework this emotion can relate to us. according to the text "" by the weight the different unite, the software can even identify mixed emotions.

most of us would havetroble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried. in fact, we humans perform this ame impressive calculation every day. Dr. Huang computer software stores similar antomical imformation as electronic code, perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are different sort of "" Da Vinci code.

Imagine a computer also knows that when you're happy or sad. According to the article "" the same technology can amake computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery"".

there is one question "" does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? yes, emotion instruction for a face that can look happy, sad,,,,etc. They are even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and foreced one. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and different muscle, the risorius. according to the aricle "" used to spot when a smilling politician or clebrity isn't being truthful.

Facial feedback theory of emotion, moving four facian muscles not only expresses emotion, but also may even help produce them. Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smilling and frowining as a way of creating these emotions on state. according to the article "" Empathy felling may happen because we unconsiously imitate another person's facial expressions"".

"To State Senator,

I think the Electoral College should be changed to popular vote because we have a lot of close presedential race nowadays. We also need to change the voting system because candidates are focusing on the ""swing states"" instead of all the states in the U.S.A. We also have the problem where one candidate can win the Electoral College and the other candidate can win the popular vote. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes. If we get rid of the Electoral College then we won't have to deal with people stressing about the candidate who should've won and the candidate who actually won.

I would rather have my vote be counted towards the president that I picked instead of electors who might pick that person. If I live in a democratic state and I'm Republican, then my vote is most likely not going to count because the electors are going to vote for the other president since the state is known to be a democratic state. Then we wonder why people don't vote; it's mostly because they know which candidate is going to win that state. With popular vote , nobody knows who will win the presidency because all 50 states have equal representation. No one state will be greater than the other.

According to paragraph 9  ""A Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after AL Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election,"" this proves that people are already thinking about having the direct election rather than the Electoral College.

"Have you heard of the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System they use it to read peoples emotion? Well there is and it to be a great invention because the device checks all of your facial bones. That means after doing that they can really find out what your emotions are like they used on the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. However, is it really something you can use in a classroom full of students? Yes, because the teacher will use it in case there's in emergeny, help , or seeing if thier doing there work knowing if they fell asleep or bored.

Even though it's a form of new technology it can also be a good thing to have in class. Like showing if a student doen't get what the teacher is teaching can help to show how their emotions are toward it ,"" A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confussed or bored."" The new technology seems as a good thing because it can help out the teacher and the students. Another thing it can do is they can know right a way with the computer and they don't have to trouble knowing that their are students who don't get at all what's going on and who to figure out what to do. Even it find out your emotions it can also find out if there genuine.

Also the device and let know if your really ""engaed"" like a real smile if it really real or it's fake. In classrooms they could be haelpful because the teacher can use to know who is really in what they are teaching or if your faking sick it tell right a way your not feeling bad. An example of this is,"" It's all the muscular action units. They even idicate the differeces between a genuine smile and if it is a forced one."" So what the device actually show is the student is feeling bad because the device show's what muscles they use and it know when it is fake and forced. The fact it can know if someone is genuine is great of what the emotion can tell if someon is lying or say the truth.

The fact that you can know emotion by a device facincating. I think it is a really helpful tool because it know the emotion and whether they are false or true. I know teachers would think the same way to because it can really help them find out what are the students they can help out. I believe that is is a good system to have in classrooms for the students and teachers. What do you think?",2,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I really enjoyed being a Seagoing Cowboy. It was a really good experience for me and I learned a lot along the way. I think anyone in for an adventure would be an amazing Seagoing Cowboy. You should really be a Seagoing Cowboy for these reasons.

One thing that made it really enjoyable was playing games with the other cowboys after we droped off the animals. We played things such as volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, baseball, and boxing. We also had a lot of extra time to whittle and read. Another thing that we had fun doing was seeing the amazing sights. I have been to an excavted castle in Crete, and the marvolous Panama Canal when I was on my way to China. The place that was most special for me to visit was the Acropolis in Greece. Another thing that was really special was taking a, ""gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with steets of water."" All of things are a really good experience for people. The last thing that was really interesting was working with the animals. I had some experience from helping my aunt Katie at her farm when I was a child. On the ship we have to feed the animals, give them plenty of drinking water, and clean the stalls three times a day.

"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article that talks about the idea of exploring Venus. In the article, it mentions a plethora of challenges that come along with exploring Venus. The challenges include such things as: 97% carbon dioxide atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulphuric acid, atmospheric pressure greater than that of Earth, and many other things. However, the author still thinks it is a great idea to explore Earth's sister planet. I happen to be one of the few, or many, individuals who think he supports his ideas very well.

Although Venus is not the safest place to explore, the author points out ways in which it can be done. He mentions NASA's idea of allowing humans to float above the fray as a way to see what is on Venus. When he says ""above the fray"", he is saying is that we could just place a blimp-like vehicle that hovers about 30 miles above Venus's treachorous landscape. This could work because as the author mentions, jet airplanes fly at a higher altitude in order to avoid dangerous storms. Storms that could knock them out of the sky and send them crashing to the ground.

The author also points out some interesting caveats that might prevent us from doing anything scientifically productive. They mention how just simply floating above Venus only allows us to see only a limited amount of stuff on the planet. This would be due to the conditions on the planet, such as the atmosphere being too dense to allow light to penetrate it. They also mention how researchers would be incapable of taking samples of things like rock or gas.

Luckily, scientists are working on innovations, possibly groundbreaking, that can help achieve an actually productive exploration of Venus. One such innovation is a simplified electronic that is made of silicon carbide. This is put to test in a chamber that simulates the conditions on Venus. The researchers are also looking back to old mechanical computers, which aren't a whole lot like the computers we have today and are more resistant to extreme conditions. Unlike our computers, these compuers make calculations using gears and levers.

In conclusion, the author supported his claim well that we can explore Venus despite its dangerous atmosphere. They rightfully point out good technologies that can be used to circumvent the atmospere and still be able to have a productive exploration. An example of such is the old mechanical computer.",3,3,3,3,2,3,2,2,3
"The Facial Action Coding System is a good idea if the general populous likes it. There is a posiblity that most everyone would like to have that coding system on their computer to make life that extra step easier. Profs. like Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe have disinged it to help keep students active in school, and to help people keep their research interesting or just make someone happy when they are angry or bored by ajusting what they are looking at on the screen.

I feel like the Facial Action Coding System will or would help students to stay awake and more aware that their computer can read their emoutions and change to how they are feeling like with ads and if you smile when you see one then more would come up like that. When you look at a website and perhaps you smile a lot on this website then the computer could adapt to wedsites that you like. If you do not like something on your computer like an ad then less of those ads would appear.

There will be people against the idea because they would feel vulnerable with a computer actually reading their emotions. It would be more practicle for you in different ways such as ajusting a lesson in school when you are starting to get bored or drousy. The computers would have a dumbed down version of the algorithm because most home desktops would not be able to work with such a complecated system but instead would be able to use the algorithm in detecting small things like a smile or a frown to tell if you liked what was on your computer monitor or not.

This would be a nice system to use but a lot of people not like the idea and they have their reasons. But here was a few to perhaps change a mind into liking the idea or just simply accepting it. Everyone has their own emotions and feelings about what they see or read about and this new system could detect those feelings, and help out to support or to completely change what was just seen by that person using a computer..",2,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.

The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.

The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.

Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,1,2
"As we are growing up riding in the front seat of our parent's, friend's, brother or sister's car we desperately can't wait until it is our time to achieve our license and follow their footsteps. The thought of having the responsiblity of someone else's life while driving can scare some people, but not me. Even though there are many different types of laws enplaced in each state following driving, it is a priveldge to be able to drive, not a right. Some people are able to drive, some are not. My parents often say don't rush to get your license because driving isn't all it seems to be but I don't care to listen, I will see for myself.

There are many different occassions in movies that take place in the future that include floating cars, driverless cars, all types of advancements in technology. We all have imagined that in the future that this would be an amazing invention that everyone would love but actually in reality, not everyone favors this. People speculate the consistency and safety that comes from techonology almost everyday, through their phones, laptops, and even their very own car. But me, I'm all in for trusting driverless cars and depending on technology to ensure the safety of my life. I feel that if these automakers can put together a car that can steer, accelerate, and even brake all on themselves, I'm sure going to try it because it would just make driving all less stressful. Even though I don't even have my license yet, I am surely optimistic in the success and excitement that these driverless cars are to become in the near future.

Techonolgy advancements that have occured just in the past decade have already impacted the quality of life for the normal human being. Inventions such as the iPhone, have made billions upon billions of dollars to Apple because people love the advantages that come with them. This is just one of the many successful technological advancements that have taken place in the past 10 years. A phone really isn't a neccesity to some people but a car on the other hand is, depending on where you live and the status of your life is a need to the average person. So if a new inventions in a phone has affected billions of lives of people around the world, then why can't a advancement in a car making the lives of people less of a hassle succeed? We can only wait and see what type of new improvement in the quality of life is soon to come any day now.",2,2,0,2,1,1,1,1,2
"With the information that has been found there's no prove that the Face has been structured by aliens. Scientist have stated that the Face was form by natural causes, others say that they may have found more information about the Face but than what they are saying. The Face was made by natural landform not created by aliens.

The face wasn't stuctured by aliens so therefore was made by natural landform. NASA has plenty of evidence that the Face was form naturally, for example that it hasn't really been discovered that aliens actually exsist. Throught the years of 1976 and 2001 there were pictures of the face not yet comepletely form so therefore scientist think it took 25 years to form comepletely. Others may say that NASA has more information than what they are telling us. For instants in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" in paragraph 5 it states that ""evidence that NASA would rather hide."" I argue that the Face wasn't created by aliens but from natural landforms.

Natural landforms, created by aliens no one will actually really know what they think. I think it was naturally formed not created by aliens there really is no real evidence about it created by aliens. There could be thousand possibilites that it was form naturally or created by aliens. There are plenty reasons to believe that it was natural causes but not as much as it being created by aliens, after all who doesn't love a good mystery.",2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Although many people are for driverless cars, I am against them.

Even though there are several benefits to driverless cars, driverless cars can be a huge problem and danger to people, not just driving or riding in the car, but pedestrians outside of the car as well.

I think driverless cars should not be allowed for several reasons.

Some of these reasons are that drivers could get more distracted, new laws would have to be made, and if an accident were to occur, the question that comes up is who should be blamed: the owner of the car, the driver of the car, or the car manufacturerer?

Driverless cars could prevent accidents, but they could cause them just as much.

Driverless cars should not be allowed for several reasons.

One of these reasons is that it could lead to more accidents than a regular car.

This is because if someone was tired when he or she was coming back home, they could potentially fall asleep because they are not driving.

If this happens, the driverless car will not be able to get the attention of the driver to take over.

Another reason why I think driverless cars should be banned is because when the driverless car is driving, the driver could get distracted by passengers or by their phones, causing them to not pay attention to the road because they are texting or playing a game or, even worse, not be able to listen to the driverless car when it is telling the driver to take over due to the passengers having a conversation with each other or the driver.

Also, like the text said, I think that if driverless cars were to be allowed, it would cause several other issues, like the making of new laws.

I also agree with another point that the text rose.

If someone were to get in an accident with a self driving car, who would be to blame: the driver or the manufacturer?

In conclusion, I think that driverless cars are just too dangerous to make leagal.

Driverless cars would be the cause of hundreds of car accidents that takek place on the streets everyday, with no one to point the finger at.

Driverless cars are not just an issue and danger to the driver, but also the passengers inside the car and pedestrians on the street.

There are several other dangers as well.

With driverless cars, the driver may get bored of not driving and accidentally fall asleep, and will not be able to wake up when the car tells the driver to take over.",2,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Cars back in the olden days required the use of a knob to turn on, but as the years have gone by, the human race has started to improve car experience. Some turn on by just the push of a smiple button, and others are able to be ridden independently; meaning that the cars can drive without the aid of a driver. Allowing a movement as big as to allowing cars to drive driverless is showing how much improvement cars have made, but alongside improvement, it guarantees safety.

Some people would say that having a driverless car is extremely dangerous because even though the car can drive itself, accidents do happen. Not only that but hackers could change the directions of where the car is meant to go and could potentially put someone in danger. Now, that could be true, but, with creating these types of cars the manufacturers know the risks so they could take precautions by adding firewalls to protect the car from getting hacked. As for reckless drivers, the cars could have cameras inside to check on the driver, to make sure he is alert while the car is driving to the driver's destination.

The safety of pedestrians, drivers, children, and passengers is cruicial when having an auomatic car, which is exactly why extreme precautions have to be taken. Some modern driverless cars have seat vibrators so that when an emergency happens, the driver can take action and keep everyone safe from harm. If the seat vibration isnt an option, then alerting the driver could be another way to potentially keep the safety of everyone without any harm being done. Not only does there have to be safety with the driver, but there also has to be safety with the car and its surroundings, which is why driverless cars have sensors all throughout the automobile, so that the car can know what its surroundings look like and make sure not to cause any incidents.

Technology is advancing, and fast. The cars being created today are getting humans a step closer into having cars that drive themselves on a daily basis in the near future. Some people may disagree and say that driverless cars can be dangerous, but if humans keep getting smarter, they will do anything possible to make those cars, the safest of cars.",3,3,2,3,1,1,2,2,2
"Looking at the factors of being able to visit Venus the author has some great points in the passage due to how dangerous it seems, The author is very correct on even asking why scientists are so drawn to visiting this unexplored planet for good reasons alone. The planet Venus has some pros and also cons. it may well once was a planet just like Earth a long time ago but that we only know. and some pros is that maybe that planet could possibly even help scientists with new possible discoveries.

Elon musk is one who is also trying something beyond of what we have ever set our sights on. he is trying to find a way to colonize mars!!, yet we also have plans to visit Venus. The Author also has some very good points on why its so difficult to even get close to the planet at all. When stated ""Each previouse mission was unmanned, and for a good reason"" in paragraph 2 is almost forshadowing the dangers of the plannet Venus.

Due to a very thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blanket venus is one of the dangers of the planet, so looking at the factors again on why the Author thinks why Venus is very difficult to set foot on or even get close to, We can just look at the planet from a safe distance. for now.",1,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,0
"SO YOU WANT TO BE A SEAGOING COWBOY

If you're reading this article, I'm guessing you want to be a Seagoing Cowboy. It's an interesting job. It doesn't require any special skills or years and years of experience. You just have to know how to take good care of animals and not get seasick easily. It's not that hard. Read on; I'll show you why.

There are a lot of great reasons to join the program. Here are some. When I was a Seagoing Cowboy,(Yes, I was!) along with helping other countries get back on their feet, I got to see awe-inspiring things, such as the Acropolis in Greece and the Panama Canal on my way to China. Taking care of the animals wasn't that hard. Sure you had to clean the poop-ridden stalls and carry up heavy bags of oats, but the animals made great company. On rides back home, you could relax and play games with the rest of the crew.

Being a Seagoing Cowboy could be dangerous, too. Once, after making my hourly report to the captain, I fell down a slippery ladder and almost went overboard and died! Luckily I got away with only a broken rib and more caution. People in the countries we aided could've been hostile. Seas could've been violent. Storms could've broken our ship to bite-size pieces. Fortunately, none of that happened;most of my trips were safe ones

When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time.",2,3,3,3,2,2,3,3,3
"The Face was discovered by NASA in 1976 when the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking photos for landing sites for Viking 2. It spotted a human-face like landform sticking out of the surface of the Red Planet. Later on, in 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took another photo of the face, revealing a natural landform, not a martian construction. Another photo in 2001 revealed no alien markings, martian buildings, or transportation.

Conspiracy theorists are guessing it was made by alien life and NASA is hiding something. Why should we? We want people to know wether martians are or were on mars. How can we do that if we don't give people all the facts?

If aliens built the Face, would there not be places to live, machinery, or other alien markings?

Plus, wouldn't the aliens have done a flawless job, not left random bumps and ledges? It is a natural process that happened when Mars formed.

Aliens did not make the face, there is no evidence.

NASA holds true to its oath of honesty and wec are not hiding anything. Marsa has a butte, not martians. And conspiracy tyheorists should try proving aliens exist instead of accusing highly trained professionals that they are lieing.",1,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"Luke Bomberger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War ll. In this passage there is a lot of good things and bad things about being Seagoing Cowboy, like what fears you have to overcome,what jobs you do, and how long you have to do it and what kind of fun they have.

To begin with,you have to be very brave to become a Seagoing Cowboy.

To become a Seagoing Cowboy you can't be scared of water or being on a boat for a long time. One day when Luke was on night watchman it was very rainy.

When he was going to make his hourly report to his captin he fell on a slippery ladder and cracked his ribs.

Next, is what jobs you do to become a Seagoing Cowboy. If you are a Seagoing Cowboy you have help a lot of people and animals.

On the way across the Atlantic Ocean, Luke's boat picked up some animals. Luke was incharge of feeding them and give them water 2 to 3 times a day. Also he had to clean up after the animals.

Last, is how long you have to be on the ship and what fun you can have.

When Luke had to cross the Atlantic Ocean it took his ship 2 weeks to get across. After the animals got unloaded, the other Seagoing Cowboys got to have some fun. The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed.

Tabel-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass time.

To sum up my thoughts, being a Seagoing Cowboy isn't that bad.

In the passage there is a lot of good and bad things about Seagoing Cowboys in the fears you have to overcome, how long you have to do it and the fun you can have, and the jobs you have to do. In the future, I hope we can have more people become Seagoing Cowboys.",2,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0
"I feel that this aspect is posatuve. If the car would be driverless then you pretty much wont need to use alot of gas, like in article 1 its says the foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. They have been trying to upgrade the cars today now they have cars that brake by their selves if the human isnt responding on time, they having systems in the car that help them out if they cant see what they are doing, like backing out of a drive way and they dont see a parked car, they have cameras now to help them out and they vibrate the seats when they are getting to close to a car. Some companies are making computer- self-driven cars. Originally, many futurists believed the key developing self-driving cars someday wasnt so much smarter cars as smarter roads. If they are going to make the cars driverless they are going to need a whole lot of sensors. Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an intertial motion sensor. But the most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings. Technology already has speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes, just in case the driver doesnt stop on time. They are testing computer driven cars to see if its safe, manufactures believe that more states will follow as soon as the cars are prooved more reliably safe. That is why i think this aspect is posative.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Theres so many roads in the world but traffic still exists. Ever think about the amount of cars in your neighborhood?, dont you think thats probaly the reason why? In the Sources 1,2,3 , and 4 all imphasizes on how having a limit of car usage can be an great advantage to society. I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.

With that being said , Limiting car use lowers air pollution. I agree with this because the less cars driven leads to less burning fuel. According to the passage by Robert Duffer paragraph 10 states that ""After days of near-record pollution, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""Due to the high population in Paris and numerous amount of the owning a vehicle causes massive car pollution. Having massive car pollution can be dangerous, this inherits sickness, stress and diseases. Refering to the source ""Car-free Day is spinning into a big hit in Bogata,Columbia"" Mayor Of Bogota (Antanas Mockus) stated that ""It's a good oppurtunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" As he rode a two seater bike with his wife. The Mayor in this content speaks the absolute truth. As you walk to your destination in the nice warm air you relive stress and diseases that were causing you to be sick before. Those are the reasons why i think limiting car usage lowers the pollution.

Additionally, Limitiing car usage decreases traffic. This is true because if there is 5 people going to the same place you are and all of you guys drive in that one car or bus that reduces the traffic. Micheal Sivak In Source 4 ( The end of car Culture) elaborates on that by saying ""What most intrgues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down two to three years before downturn, I Think that means something more fundamental is going on.""What Mr. Sivak means by this is that everyone should only have a certain amount of car per household and person Which will also lower the traffic. Traffic in paris is very long but due to the car-free act traffic was reduces. from reading source 2 by Robert Duffer ,it states ""Congestion was down 60 % in the capital of france (Paris), after five days of intensifying smong."" Just in five days of no driving the air is already unpolluted imageded if you drived five days all day. Those are the reasons why i think that Limiting car usage is an advantage.

To Conclude,I believe that the limiting of car usage is an great advantage. This is true because Limiting care usage lowers pollution, Decreases traffic.",3,2,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"Even though the idea of a driverless car is ludicrous, humans continue to test it out. Sergery Brin has contemplated the car for awhile and has been attempting to maunfacture the vehicle. With an idea that very extravagant, the plan itself would take a long process and an expensive amount of money. Though the driverless cars are being built, the vehicles aren't completely driverless and still has more work to be accomplished. Bin has been asked and has thought of the what the driverless car can do, but many people are conflicted about the safety of the car.

Over the years technology continues to develop and the driverless cars are now the newer way to entertain the hum race. Google has assisted in making the car and has made it to where the human driver has to be caution. The scientists and manufactured the car to help reduce the percentage of car accidents. The car has been built to help the driver when they are in danger or when they are accelerating, about to brake, etc. When they are about to give the control to the human driver, they signal an alarm of some sort and the driver is then given the wheel. If there is a speed limit over twnety-five mile per hour, the driver will have to keep their hands on the wheel and this will help the driver keep alert.

Though the car is built to help on the road and help the drivers, the car can't help with everything. Drivers could happen to fall asleep or be very bored when the car is driving itself and would then cause an issue. If the situation of there being a car accident occurs, someone wouldn't know whether to press charges against the driver or against the manufacturer. The situation of pressing charges to whoever could cause a disruption amongst the people and the businesses.

Though the driverless car is in the process of being built, there are new ideas, situations, and ways that the car could do for the human race and the community. With only a few states to test the cars, the tests are limited to see what the cars can drive through. the question of the acr being completely driverless is still unanswered. There are new discoveries that we have yet to find out about the car when it is done and has been thoroughly been tested. Technology has yet to advance with the driverless car.",1,1,0,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Vroom! Vroom! Is the familiar and common sound heard all across the world. Can you believe that cars can be so helpful and convienient, yet cause so many problems? The United States, Environmental Protection Agency, jumped on board with it's new promotion of, ""car reduced"" communities. This is a new act that will limit car usage, and help protect our Earth's environment. Motorits all over the world are contributing to the Greenhouse effect, stress, congestion, and pollution in the air we breathe. Countries such as, Columbia, France, and Germany are trying to reduce pollution, and the long term affects of cars have on the world.

Middle-class families, ranging from Chicago to Shanghai, make a huge impact on our greenhouse. Up to about fifty percent in the US alone emits carbon dioxide gas, instead of trying to reduce it. According to the international agency headquarters in London, the congestion and traffic within the capital of France, went down sixty percent, after fining citizens for being on the road after five days of a near-record pollution. The smog that covered this global city had one hundred fourty seven microorganisms per cubic meter. They had blamed diesel fuel as the reason for the smog. The cold nights and warm days trapped car emissions. If we started this new idea, we would see a large improvement within our enviromnment.

Beep! Beep! Traffic is such a stressful situation to be in. Wheather it is on your way to work, going home, getting lunch, or going to see a friend, the streests are flooded. This new act will promote the simplicity of transportation. This will release a lot of stress on people, and make their lives happier and healthier. People will be more connected and involved with their community and surroundings. Sidewalks are being layed out all throught cities, for people to find a new efficient way of transportation such as, walking or riding a bike.

Some countries are so used to not having a car or even having a space to put a vehicle. In Vauban, Germany, people are giving their cars up more and more. They just see the positive affects this ""car-free"" act has on them. Today seventy percent of families that live there do not own cars. The rate of people getting their license has gone down dramaticlly as well. Car companies are scared for their business if everyone tries to conserve energy.

This limitation of moterized vehichles may be just what the world needs to improve it's environment. This saves more energy, reduces pollution, keeps people healthy and stressfee. Living a life of simplicity will make you more happier.",3,3,2,3,0,0,1,1,0
"I believe that the so called face is just a natural landform. It is just a mountain with shadows that create an illusion of a face. In the very first picture of this landform it was very blurry, now cameras has evolved so now it is clear.

NASA wanted to figure out if this was a ancient face or an regular landform. So , 22 years later NASA went back to Mars to figure out what this landform is. With the technology NASA have they took pictures of the landform and they found out it was just a regular landform.

NASA wanted to do a double-check so in 2001 they took some more pictures. Now the pictures came out more clear than the last picture in 1998. Then NASA proved once again that it was just a natural landform.

Those are the reasons why that it is a natural landform. It was proved twice and the pictures were accurate, 3 times better the vision the last time they took a photo. Even with all the evidence some still believe that it is an acient Egyptian pharoh face on Mars.",1,3,2,3,1,2,1,1,2
"Driverless cars are a great innovation in the car industry. The new driverless cars will make driving more enjoyable, more fuel efficient, and make driving safer.

One main advantage about a driverless car is the stress of driving will go away. No more will people have to deal with other people riding their tail, speeding, and not abiding by the laws of the road.

Another reason is fuel consumption. The future looks good for mother earth, when driverless cars are invented they are thought to use only half the fuel the normal everyday car would guzzle up. This is a major positive with the prices of fuel rising and in more demand than ever.

They will also make driving safer by eliminated humans from the equation. People are amazing at a lot of things but driving isn't always one of them. By letting the person sit back and relacks while their car does the driving, this automatically eliminates the human factors of: being tired, undecisive on what to do, or not very good at driving. Eliminating this will make car crash rates go way down.

Some people think driverless car are to dangerous and raise questions like,"" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer? "" This is an example of one of the many questions being raised but the technoloy failing and someone getting hurt, is no different than the brakes failing and someone getting hurt. And most all driveless car have the ability to let the human take the wheel if the car is in trouble.

Driverless cars are a great innovation in the car industry. The new driverless cars will make driving safer, more fuel efficient, and more enjoyable for driver but until they officially release one no one can says if they are a magnificent idea or down right terrible idea.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,2,2
"Do you think driverless cars would become a problem? Well i think they would and i will be giving you some reasons why it would become a problem. First i will talk about lawsuits. Second i will talk about how it would affect the law. Last i will talk how it will hurt mechanics jobs.

Driverless cars is a bad idea because of many reasons. First i will start by conflict with the owner and the company. Whose fault would it be if the owner got into and accident would it be the companys fault because they said the car is driverless? All i see is that it would cause great conflict. There probaly would be a lot of lawsuits against the companys.

Another reason driverless cars would be bad is cause they would have to change the law. How could they give the owner a speeding ticket if they wern't even driving? would the car be set to go a certain speed and if it was how would the car know what the speed limit was? I can just see that becoming a big problem. Also i can see people thinking it would be okay to text an drive because its not like there driving anyways. Would it be okay to text and drive? How would anyone feel safe? What happens if the car was to have malfunction and cause a car pile up all because people were to lazy just to drive!

Another problem would be how would mechanics make there money a lot of people would lose there job over it. Would the goverment require a degree to work on these cars? It wouldn't be fair to the people who went to school to become a mechanic and then these self driving cars come out

that would be basically ran off a computer. Those mechanic would have basically payed thousands of dollars for no reason.

Now do you think driverless cars would become a problem? There would be a lot of lawsuits because of driverless cars. The goverment would have to change the law. Last mechanics would lose there jobs. So in all realitty in my opinion driverless cars would become a huge problem,",2,3,1,3,0,0,0,1,0
"The Electoral college is a way of voting for Presidency. Electors are the people who consist of that. Their are 538 electors. A majority of the 270 votes is required to elect a president, The 23rd amendment of the constitution states that 3 electors and treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. The candidate's political party generally choose the electors. The Presidential election is held every 4 years on the tuesdaay after the first monday in november.

"Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and Dr. Paul Eckman have been able tro design, read and determine emotions using a computer software called Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Using this technology, they were able to make a computer generated 3-D model of the face in this world famous painting. Using the muscles that lay underneath the skin in this 3-D model, the software is able to determine the emotion of the person based off of the physical characteristics and movement of the muscles.

In using the FACS software ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored' predicted Dr. Huang"" (paragraph 6). Much like a classroom instructor, the computer and software will be able to modify the lesson and instruction to further engage and explain to the student.

However, in a classroom, it seems that teachers will rarely change lesson plans to engage their students, and will further explain only if a specific question is asked, regardless of the look of confusion of the students' faces.

Futhermore, teachers and program writers would have to code for and write many forms of the lesson to explain or engage the students before uploading it to the computer for lessons. If a student is bored or confused, the software and computer system will have to be able to 1) recognze the facial expression and 2) choose from several lesson plans to fit and better the facial expression of the student/user.

As a student, I do not find myself to be facially expressive on the computer, in fact the only expresson I have is within my mind, while my face remains blank. This would make it impossibke for the FACS to identify bordom or confusion. There is also the possiblilty of the software confusing one of these facial expressions with that of concentration when reading or writing.

The article states that "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" (Paragraph 7) If the same algorithms (FACS) would be used to determine the facial feature of Mona Lisa and her expression to aid the computer in determining the facial characteristics and emotions of a student. At our 1-on-1 technology based school, students can either rent laptops or provide their own for school work. If our personal computers cannot store the algorithms of FACS to determine the facial features of students then it would be entirely useless. The school would have to purchase entirely new computers for every student in the school, with the RAM and capacity to read emotions and contain the FACS. These computers would have to be laptops so they can be transported between classes, school and home. This would be too costly for the school or students and improbable in being able to find and provide the correct kiond of computer.

If the FACS needs to be able to computer generate a 3-D model of the face, the computer would run signifigantly slower because it is trying to read your emotions and run any other programs you have open for your class work. Unlike the Mona LIsa, our faces are already three-dimensional, however the computer software would have to be able to generate a computer model of the students face and expression by examining the muscles underneath in the model, which in all liklihood would take much longer to complete than it does for an expression to change or the comprehension of a subject ot take place.

To conclude, although the Facial Action Coding System would hypothetically work to decide emotions, it would be entirely too costly, time consuming, and unlikey in te effectivness of being able to read the expressions of students during class.",4,3,3,3,1,2,2,3,2
"I would just like to start off by saying that the reason why the author thinks that we should keep studing Venus no matter the dangers is because his words ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

Other reasons we should study Venus is because there is so much more that people today do not know and I personallly feel like as long as we are here on Earth we should be currious about why only our plannet is the only plannet that has humans on it or at least they say. In the article they said ""Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system "". We as people should be and should want to be more nosey.

Not only do we people want study Venus but Venus wants us to study it. It is one of the easiest stars to see in the night sky. As the article says ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"", is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"".

I also would like to add that it would not be a bad idea to study Venus more bc we already have many facts about this planet so it is not like you would be starting completly from scratch. Some of the facts that we already know that was given to us from the article is ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"", ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"", and ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"".

Lastly I would just like to say that I hope from reading this essay I was able to draw you in and hopefully make you more currious and questionable about Venus like would'nt you want to know what is out there or at least what used to be out there or even better what could possiabley going to happen out there.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The story I read is called Unmasking The Face on Mars. I will conveince people that it was not created by aliens. That it was a natural land form amd mothing else.

The face on Mars is a natural land form that is just rocks and the shadows that made it look like a face. The way the rocks were fromed they made it look like a face when it really was not. The shadows from the planet also played a part in the story. It gave an illusion that the eyes, nose, and mouth peolpe just wanted to make a big deal of nothing.

The way the people tried to make it bigger than what it is that makes people more hype and they are going to think that it life on Mars. There is nothing on Mars like an other life froms. It was just a crazy story that somebody made up to get people to panic or take intrest in nothing. All they did was make free addvirstivement for NASA thats really all they did.They was all over the place they was in magazines, books, Hollywood films and haunted grocery store checkout.

Some of the scientist wanted it to be a alien artifact but they knew it was not. If it was aliens it could have been big for the NASA funding. They could have had a lot of money to buy more stuff to get more on the face. It had to shoot threw clouds to see the face so the clouds could have made it look like a face. It was also winter time so that could have played an important part in the Mars face story. If thier're is any thing there you would have saw it in the image three times bigger than the pixel size. If there was a plane on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even a small shack, you could see what they were.

Thats why there is no aliens on Mars I think it would never be any life in Mars. If there ever was any life on the Red Planet it would have been found. There will never be life on Mars as I am concerned.",2,3,2,2,0,0,1,2,0
"Dear state senator,

Ever since 1776, The United States of America has been a great example of freedom, excellence, and democracy. After all, the U.S. is one of the biggest supporters of democracy, and is all about the rights of their people. So imagine my shock to learn that this country, in fact, does not rely on it's people to vote for their leader. Which, to many people would be the simplest form of freedom out there. Instead, we have the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a number of electors that represent a state. ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...."" (What Is the Electoral College? by the Office of the Federal Register) In this quote, it explains that the Electoral College is based on the existing population in your state; therefore, the more people you have, the more electors the state receives. However, this sounds great and all, but in my opinion, a direct democracy would work great for this country because it would generate just representation of the people by allowing them to make the vote, encourage voters and remind them that they have a voice, and immediately destroy the chances of a representative to vote for an opposing candidate.

America is all about their people. And of course, the government wants to do what's best for them, right? Voting is a right that American citizens achieve when they reach the matured age of eighteen. It's supposed to feel like a blessing that we get to decide and have a voice in the process of election. But, with the Electoral College, it ""...may turn off potential voters of a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner) So the citizens of this country are beginning to feel like their say in this decision will have little to no impact. This will affect the amount of voters and will ultimately cause a huge problem in the way people feel about representation.

Enough about the people, how about the electors? ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer) This means that not even when the people vote for all their electors and they should be selecting the correct candidate, they may change their minds. Electors are people too, and people may have their opinions swayed and then the electors could vote for the other candidate. It is scary to think that the candidate everyone chose and was rooting for might not win because someone decided to make a different decision.

And some people might stand up for the Electoral College, say that ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates...to focus their campain efforts on the toss-up states."" (In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Posner) It later goes on to say that because of this, the citizens in the Swing States become the most thoughtful voters because they receive the most information on the candidates. However, wouldn't we, as a country, prefer all of our potential voters to be informed and well-aware of our candidates? ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states...focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" (The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer) Why should the fate of the presidency be laid in the hands of such a small amount of people when our country is meant to be for everybody in the land?

As a concluding statement, senator, I want you to consider my argument that we'd be better off without the Electoral College because citizens should be able to decide who they want to run, they should feel important, they should all be well-informed, and electors that change their minds wouldn't even be a problem anymore. Thank you for taking the time to consider my letter.

Sincerely,

Concerned Citizen",4,4,3,3,2,2,3,3,3
"I believe that driverless cars should be allowed for everyone. The cars could help certain people if they are occupied with something else. Some people may not be able to have a driverless car because even though it's driverless, they still have to be there in case of an emergency. Other people may just ignore the signals of the car and it could cause a wreck to occur.

Driverless cars could benefit many people in many different ways. The driver may need to take an important business call, and they can do that while the car is still going. The person could also have an injury and need to go to the emergency room, but have no one else to take them there. If the person has children one of their kids could need something, so they could help them while still going where they need to go. Also, the driver could've woken up late and needs to hurry to work. They could finish getting ready in their car or eat their breakfast. They may need to finish their make up or brush their hair and you can't do that with both of your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.

I also believe it would be diffucult to know who is at blame for a wreck. The car could mess up and it would be the manufacturers fault, but if the driver is not paying attention it would be their fault. The driver may not want to take responsibilty and admit to not paying attention to the signals of the car. The idea of having cameras in the car to watch the driver is very interesting. It may feel weird being watched by something, but it would help figure out who is to blame.

The idea of driverless cars is a little frightening though. There are people that may take advantage of it and not pay attention to whenever they need to take control of the car. The idea is also excellent for someone that may need the time to do something else. I approve of the idea, but there is always the slight chance of someone messing it up. Hopefully if driverless cars become a thing, they will make everything safer and nothing bad will happen because of them. If driverless cars become a regular thing, I think they need to be figured out and practiced with a lot more.",2,3,2,3,2,2,2,3,3
"""Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions (Nick D'Alto)."" Having the technology to read student emotions in class is not valuable because it would cost a fortune and it would be a distraction.

The software to detect the emotions of students would be too expensive and that makes the Facial Action Coding System not valuable. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile (Nick D'Alto)."" Most schools have standard home computers in class, which means the school will spend a fortune to replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers. After replacing the computers schools will still have to buy the Facial Action Coding System, which will most like cost alot of money that could be used for other things.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable is because it would be a distraction in a classroom. ""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions (Nick D'Alto)."" After being told one student's emotion the other students in that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson.

"The text

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" treats a very important decision, that is the worthines of pursuing or not the study of the planet Venus despite the danger it presents, the author agrees to this idea of pursuing said study, but he support's his idea of studying Venus in a very poorly way.

The autor of

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" made the text so that people would know the rewards of exploring Venus, but during the text he does nothing but make the idea less apealing to the eyes of the people, this is shown by the following excerpt ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience in our own planet.... Venusion geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""this excerpt is one of the reasons this text apeals more to an idea of disagreement than one of agreement, making the reader feel more inclined to disagree with the authors oppinion, being this the opposite of the whole reason of the text.

This also can be shown by the next quote "" However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the panet can provide only limited inshight on ground conditions... More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.""

this quote not only does not help the authors point of view but it also contradicts this passage, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientis to float above the fray."" this causes a clash of ideas, wich is not a good think to try and convince people.

In conclusion the Text of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" creates a feeling of disagreement/fear towards the idea of studying the planet venus, this is conflicting with the idea of worhtines of pursuit of venus that the author tries to give the text, meaning that the text does not support the author's idea and if it does it, is in a very poorly way.",3,3,3,2,0,0,1,3,0
"Technology is a big part of today's society. I feel that technology is over used. People today are finding ways to have technology do simple tasks for us. For example, instead of using a book, a student looks at a screen all day. Now the idea of autnomous cars has been around for a few years. I am not for autonmous cars because texting while driving will increase, jobs at gas stations will decrease, and it will cause people of the future to become less active than they already are.

In today's society, texting and driving is another issue we have. If a person is in an autonomous car and are only needed when the car cannot navigate through certain driving conditions, the driver could text much more leading to wrecks caused by drivers texting. Therefore, the autonomous care being unsafe for the roads.

If autonomous cars begin to get popular, jobs at gas stations will begin to decrease. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", it states ""The cars he, Sergey Brin, foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis..."" This statement indicates that there will be less gas needed to put into this autonomous car which will lead to gas stations around cities will lessen. Some may say that is a plus because they don't have do pay twenty dollars to put in gas every week; however, I believe that if these autonomous cars come about, the need for gas will be less and jobs will be lost. Without people needing a whole lot of gas, what's the point in multiple gas stations around town?

People in today's society are already inactive as it is with all the technology that is available. For example, there is shopping online so they don't have to leave home and cellular phones and computers to connect with people without leaving home. The companies trying to manufature the autonomous car will be another advanced technology that will make today's people even more inactive. It seems today with all of these technology, the world will soon be over ran by all of these techonologies. Therefore, the manufacturers should not continue making devices such as the autonomous car.

In passage two it said that ""in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency"".""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. And yet , the electoral college still has its defenders. what gives?

The second reason why I said that we should Abolish  the electoral college is because it  confuse people. when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the  presidency I bet  a lot of people were confused. Most people would have pefered a direct election to the one we have now.

The last reason why I said that we should Abolish the electoral college is because  candiates don't spend enough time in the states. what i mean by that is that is because of the winner take all system they know that they don't have a chance of winning. In the passage it said that during the 2000 campaig, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.

In conclusion the reason why we should abolish the electoral college is because it effects who becomes president, it confuses people, and candiates dont't spend enough in the states. Now that i told you my reason don't you think the same.",2,3,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
"The picture of faces on Mars are actually natural landforms, known as buttes or mesas. The text states that the picture really shows a Martian version of a butte or mesa. The text also states that you can find other mesas around the American West. Mesas are pieces of land that above ground-level. The author also stated that, Garvin, a mission controller, said that it reminded him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho and that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars. Although, I can see why people would think it was created by aliens, there are more facts to prove that its a natural landform. Scientists have shown that, as of right now, there are no signs of life on Mars, so aliens could not have made it. In conclusion, science has proved many more facts about the Face than a conspiracy theorist has.",2,4,3,3,1,2,2,3,3
"In the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, in the first paragraph it ask you, ""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" In response to that question, I believe that the future does have ideas for such things, Why? Technology has taught us to be creative, we live in a world where you almost have to do nothing for yourself. So computer operrated cars are no shock to my eyes and ears, well until it actually happens...

I will begin talking about the risk being ensured, I say ensured because it is almost bound to happen to have reported accidents and or malfunctions.

In the article it mentions people testing out and making assumptions to these self driven cars. One statement caught my eye when saying ""They worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical."" That is one example of why we shouldn't be putting self driven cars on the road, they're going to be expensive and always needing an upgrade, what if you're driving, well your car is driving itself, and you run into an issue while on the road with others out there, could the car malfuntion and cause you to lose your life?

I do believe that people only do things because they feel as if they need to be up to date on what the new and improved inventions: Not saying I wouldn't have fun, but am I wiling to risk my life along with others?

There are some positive perks about these self drivin cars... One being The necessititaes the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention when the car is about to run into, on going traffic, construction sites, and or a route to which a human is needed to attend the wheel.

Have they thought about giving examples on when a good time to use these cars instead of an everday drive? I think more advice would help give a good responsible outlook on these cars. I mean it all sounds fun in games to have something to futurisitic, but let's be realisitic and think about the cost, and how much you will need to update on it, do you need a certain type of insurance to purchase this car? Is my safety guarenteed?

These questions i asked would need to be answered before i ever think about buying, everyone needs to know the answers to these questions before not even thinking about all of the above.

In conclusion I would like to say that although it sounds fun it's too risky for me to try. I hope when these cars have passed the laws that the laws aren't broken... I will be sticking to my own driving for myslef, i like to have control and know whats ahead for me. I think driverless cars are ignorant and no needed.",2,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0
"Hey Earth has a twin. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author strongly suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author's idea may sound wild to some he does support his argument very intelligently.

To begin the author supports his ideas by giving back ground knowledge on Venus. The author then preoceeds to scientificly explain the orbits that Venus, Mars and Earth under takes.""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space termshumans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" The explanation that the author gives us shows us the simalirty of the planets and the efforts of exploring Venus is important despite its conditons.

In paragraph 4 the author uses a rhetorcle device ""If our sister planet is so inhostible, why are scientist even discuusign further vistits to its surface. The author uses a rhetoricle quetsion to get his point across to the reader. The author goes further into depth by describing the geogrphics of Venus and how it could of been a Earth like planet long ago."" Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""

The author brings in NASA into the conversation and explains to us how they have been working to explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" Although the author is fully aware of the extreme condtions of Venus they still don't believe that hoviering 30 miles from Venus wont provide them with enough information. The author also argues that scientist wont have the ability to take samples of rocks,gas,etc. The author even goes further by saying"" Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to undestand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"".

Well Earth may have a twin, but they are not identical. Despite the harsh conditions of Venus the aurthor does a great job with supporting their idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. Not to forget the author supported their claim with lots of evidence provied through out the text.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"In my opinion, the Facial Action Coding System is not something I would want in my classroom or in my home. There is no need for computers to read human emotion espcially in schools where security is a big issue. Having this technology in school laptops and larger organizations could potentially be a security issue becuase it may make it easier to hack or break into computers. This technology has a potential to bring much more harm than it does good.

I know that teachers in my classrooms can very easily tell when someone in their class is bored or is having a hard time paying attention, there is no need for a computer software to tell them how all of their students are feeling. In the text, it states """"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."""" All teachers are doing their best at their job and have seperate teaching styles, we can not base their ability to teach off of one or two who are feeling bored becuase they have a short attention span that day.

While I think technology is amazing I also think that it should'nt be such a large chunck of students lives, especially in school. Relying on technology could make it easier for potential threats like hackers or people who may want to harm students or to get into schools, installing something like FACS could make it even easier to break in. In this day and age, I think we rely too much on technology and its abilities, we have no need for a facial scanner that can tell our emotions when humans can already do the same. In the text, it says"" Can we actually ""calculate"" emotions."" Humans can already tell what a person is feeling by lloking at their face.

All in all, this technology doesnt seem worth it to me. There are too many cons and risks and they greatly outweigh the pros and rewards. Classrooms are not a place for a program like this and neither are organizations like hospitals or any other place. It could be a potential security risk to all who use it. This Facial Action Coding System should'nt be supported by any schools or progress beyond a simple idea.",3,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1
"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",4,3,3,3,0,1,1,2,1
"Driverless cars are the future. Sergey Brin is the creator of the Google Cars. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world. They are made to take people to where they need to go without them really even having to drive. The only time the person will need to take over is when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. These cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus.

My opinion on these new inventions is that I do not think these cars are needed and i don't think that they will be the next big thing. A lot can go wrong with them. The car could malfunction and possibly get a lot of people into a crash. The article says that the car is made so it automatically sensors the driver when they are needed. They are supposed to have seats that vibrate to notifty the driver, but what if the driver doesn't notice it and they end up crashing and hurt a lot of people.

The cars are also supposed to have cameras to watch that the drivers are remaining focused on the road. While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. But what if the camera breaks and it takes a while for the owner to get it fixed. Then how is the car going to watch the person? Plus by having these it just makes us all a little more lazier. Driving can be fun and nice to know how to do. I myself, enjoy driving. I personally think it's fun.

Our lives are being taken over by technology. Everyone now a days depends on it. They're lost without it. By making cars that will drive us around, without us barely even having to drive it is stupid. They're also most likely going to be outragiously expensive. The name also does not make sense. Why call it ""driverless"" cars, if people are still going to have to drive it.

The article states, ""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" In my opinion, it all just depends on the situation. If the car itself has an issue then its going to be the manufacturer's fault, but if the person just wasn't paying attention, then it is the driver's fault. To come to a conclusion, driverless cars are not worth all the hard work and time. They may be in style for a few months, but then i think people will get tired of them and just go back to their regular car.",3,3,2,3,1,2,2,3,2
"We as people want to explore to new levels that no one has ever been to. Some of those things could be going to Venus. You would be the first person to go, everyone would love you, and you would get so much fame. Here's some things that you don't know about. It's exreamly dangerous and your chances of survival and very slim. By slim I mean next to none.

The planet is 97% carbon dixoide so we wouldn't be able to breath and you have have to be in a space suit with limited oxygen supply. Next, you wouldn't be able to touch the surface considering that the average temperatures and 800 degress fahrenheit. When you're there you won't be able to collect materails such as rocks, gases, or even anything else because you won't be able to get to there surface and anything you use to try to touch the surface will melt.

When you are there you will be experiencing 90 times more atompheric pressure than you would here on earth. It would literally crush you to be present on the surface of Venus. Not to mention you could be the second fatherist away from earth and that'll make it longer to get back to earth than normal. Also, when you are there the planet is rotating faster than it would on earth and make you very sick.

So, before you decide to make big leaps and explore new places you got to know what you can and can't do. The author from the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gave me my information and did an amazing job explaining and getting me to understand how harse Venus could really be. You are limited to far heights and it's your choice to find them.",1,3,1,2,0,0,1,1,1
"Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary like Sergey Brin. As a matter of fact google has bulit such cars since 2009. However some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. I'm honestly split about each side.

Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecologicly friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way more safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a marjor area that is adressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automaticly breaks the car to avoid any damage.

However, there is some glaring issues that must be adressed. First off people will get bored beccause they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this everytime your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Taking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, whos to blaim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. It's stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.

In conclusion, I'm split about this idea. Driverless cars might be the next evolution for the motor companies, but it is flawed in some rather serious degrees.",3,3,1,3,0,1,1,2,2
"Many people forsee that driverless cars are the future of public transporation. Companies such as Google, have already make driverless cars fitted with various sensors to help them guide themselves around cities and navigate through traffic. Since 2009, various improvements have been make to make these driverless cars more efficient and safe. I believe that there should be continued development for driverless cars because of what they can do to change way we see public transportation today.

Driverless cars have been improving since the 1950s, ever since General Motors created track car that could drive itself around using radio signals and electrical cables. In the 1980s, various sensors were added to automobiles in the aid of the creation of antilock brakes. Driverless cars also know when to give the wheel to the driver when situation calls for the need. And now, Google has make multiple advancements to driverless cars to make them more efficient and safer around cities and pedestrians. Tesla has predicted that if there is continued development for driverless cars, automobile companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi and Nissan will have self-driving cars by 2020. This shows that with the continued development of driverless cars will surely change the future in years time.

Driverless cars have shown that they could potentially change the future of driving. Through continued development from the 1950s all the way to today, driverless cars have shown that they are capable of driving through cities and populated areas and are smart enough to evade danger until the driver needs to take over. I believe that if there is continued development for driverless cars, they will develop enough to completely take over public transportation and allow more people to be safe when on the road.",2,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0
"Have you ever wonder if a planet from outer space is safe? Today we will be talking about venus. Studying venus isvery great experience for a human to do, you get to learn about other planet. In paragraph 2 the author said "" Venus is the closest to earth in term density and size,""but is the planet venus safe for us to travel?

Numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study. Venus is a very hard planet to find out. For humans to study if it's safe or not. In venus a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. It's not safe for a human to go there cause of the acid clouds which is unsafe atmosphere for humans to breath in. Venus is a lot hotter than earth it it is over 100 its going to be hard for humans to breath.

On the planet’s surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. If the temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit it's very hot in venus and it's very dangerous for a human to travel there. It maybe the closest to earth but the atmosphere in venus is very dangerous for a human body. It is easy for a human to study venus. It's hard to get information if you dont get a chance to visit venus you don't learn abouy it. They stated "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus""

They think that venus could've supported various forms of life. They are trying to state that venus could've have human life and animals and plants on venus planet but they are still not sure if it's safe or not. In paragraph 3 they stated ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" They said venus was probably covered in ocean just like earth. Which mean venus is almost same as earth. Some people could've live in venus but they wasn't sure if it's safe or not.

To sum all this up I think that the more human study venus the more dangerous information they will get. No matter how much they study venus it is not safe and you will only get more dangerous. Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. In paragraph 6 they said ""scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Scientists are willing to have a personal despite risks just to learn about venus. Venus is a dangerous planet but almost as same as a earth that we live in venus clouds are acid.",3,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The way they say it assist you is very helpful for the elderly. Some people are handicape and was waiting for an idea like this. Everybody isn't able to move around and do alot of things because they are disabled but a invention like this will change all of those problems.

I gave as many reason as I can about the wonderful invention. The main reason is it will help the commuinty and maybe the robbery rate will go down because alot of people wouldn't have to walk anywhere for them to get ran up on an rob or worse murdered.",0,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Venus, sometimes called the ""evening star""is one of the bightest points of light in the night sky.

But, the nickname is misleading because Venus is actually a planet.

Venus is a challenge place to examine closely.

Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus could potential have life forms, can be the nearest option for a planetary visit, and people can gain others things from it not only information.

Venus could be the nearest option for a planetary visit if something happened to Earth.

The article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" it states,""recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long frames of space travel""(4).

This shows that if reseachers find a way to visit Venus without trouble, it can change the world.

This ties in with the thesis by doing this could be dangers,but it can open the world by new ways.

Also this shows that if something could have happened to Earth, people could go to Venus.

People can gain other things from going to Venus not only information.

The article states, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself""(8).

This shows that we could gain other things not only just the planet itself.

This also shows that the dangers of getting this information is going to be hard, but in the long run it will be worth it.

Venus could have life forms and feature if we don't go and discover it.

The article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""could have supported various forms of life""(4).

This shows that Venus could have support life if we explore it and find out.

This ties in with the thesis by even if the dangers are big it will be worth it if Venus could support life. This also shows that if Venus has life forms we could potential could make it in the long run.

Venus could have potential of having life forms, can be a closest option for a planetary visit, people can gain information these all are a worthly pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is a challenging path but it shows promising stuff.

If the risk factors are great, we will find a way to get there.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Since the 1900's cars have been an integral part of our lives. It seems everyone has one nowadays. But this overuse of cars is starting to have a negative effect on our enviroment and is causing mass traffic jams that put cities on halt. We as a society must start limiting our car usage to help save our enviroment and to stop traffic jams that do not let the city run smoothly.

Cars were and still are one of the best inventions man has ever made, so it is understandable why people would have such a hard time letting go of something that is so useful. But one must understand that although the car is useful it is also hurting other things, whether it be inadvertant or not. Cars have always been bad on the enviroment, now so more then ever. According to

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars passenger cars are responsible for 12 % of greeenhouse emissions and up to 50% in some car intensive areas in the United States. This shows that we as a society are one the of the main reasons why are enviroment is crumbling around us. These greenhouse emissions and mass pollution by cars are hurting the enviroment whether we want it to or not. Everybody must take a look at these numbers and see the negative effect they are having on the enviroment and realize that by simply not using a car they can help save the enviroment. Another example of the bad effects cars have on the enviroment can be found in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog.

In the article it talks about how Paris had to enforce a driving ban due to the amount of pollution in the air from cars. The fact that a driving ban had to be implemented to stop pollution is absolutley ridiculous. This alone should show people that refuse to see the negative effects they are having on the enviroment around them that car usage should and must be cut down. By simply cutting down our usage of cars we as people can help save the enviroment. Who would not want to be a part of that?

Cars have always been viewed at as the best mode of transportation. Everyone believes that their car can always get them to the place they need the fastest. But what most people do not think about is the mass traffic jams in cities that the usage of cars can cause. If people simply cut down there car usage and try out other forms of transportation it actually could get them to the destination they want the quickest. An example of this can be found in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota.

In the article it says when they banned cars for the day the huge traffic jams in the city suddenly went away. This allowed people on bikes and buses to actually get around quicker than they usually could with their cars. So by not using cars people actually got around to the places they needed to be due to the lack of traffic jams in the city.

The amount of cars driven on the road per day has risen to an astronomical number over the years. Although cars may be efficient they also have many harmful effects. Two of the worst are the effect they have on the enviroment and the mass traffic jams they cause. We as a society must recognize that by cutting down our usage of cars we can actually have a positive effect on our enviroment while also allowing ourselves the ability to bring traffic jams to a minimum.",4,4,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"I think that the auther is right about studying venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because if Venus is so close to the sun it and is one of the hottest planest because is close to the sun, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like the Earth.

Venus is similar like the earth they have valleys,mountains,and craters. But we don't know if they have food. they mayhave alliens because of the tempertures. And it can be dangerous to the Earth because we are the closest one to Venus.

scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contibute meaningfully to our knowledges of venus.

NASA has the power and money to send people and invest about all these things.

NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

NASA's posssible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to flot above the roiling Venusian landscape.

Or maybe Venus is just a start because of his nickname and is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to oour sun.

Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present addicional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent ligtning strikes to probes seeeking to land on its surface.

NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to flot above the fray.

Venus i the closet planet to the Earth in term of density and size and occasionally the closest in distance to. Should be more easy to study but the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission.

we should invest if in Venus exist phone or tablet or system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces.

we all have questions like ""if Venus move around just like the Earth does"".

We all want to konw ""if Venus produce live"".

we should keep invest why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus

The temperature that Venus has is too hot for humans is more extreme that anything and the weather present additional impediments like erupting volcans.

Why venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

My conclusion is that yes we shoud study Venus because it may have humans been in their planet, because they have water,sun,just like the Earth does. and our travels on Earthand beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubst but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. And sent more people to Venus and see what they have as a planet.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The long list of benefits that comes from limited car usage are mostly based on where you live and how much you do your part. Laws and restrictions have been arriving across the entire world to see the effects of having little or no automobiles in the community. Other countries that have an intense cloud of smog need to ban car use in the millions at a time to help settle down the atmosphere there.

Life without cars today can be very well described in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars . In her article she describes how the community is shaped and condensed in order to make travelling to necessarry places easy through walking or bike riding distance. This is the kind of turn around that the world needs as well. With the amount of pollution happening, this is a good experiment that will hopefully spread all over the planet.

The amount of pollution affecting certain cities across the world is getting rather out of hand. In Robert Duffer's article

Paris bans driving due to smog , he talks about the intense pollution over France's capital, resulting in the partial ban of almost

HALF

of the amount of cars on the road at once. Those who violated the ban's rules were fined, and thousands of cars were impounded as well due the the reaction of citizens when they received the fine. In paragraph 14 of the article, Duffer states that ""

Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France ,

after five days of intensifying smog.""

The ban clearly worked, showing that it was indeed the heavy number of vehicles on the road all at once.

Programs all across the world have gotten people in the millions to find other methods of travel that did not cause any pollution. Columbia is a huge example as shown in Andrew Selsky's article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota . In the article, Selsky specifies about how millions of Columbians have taken alternative modes of transport, whether it be hiking, biking, or skating as opposed to general driving. Even on account of rain, the citizens found ways to get about without using their cars. This is making Bogota a more human and social place as well, as Selsky states, ""

Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks.""

This event is happening for the good of the people and of the planet, and it seems like everyone is okay with that.

With the way our world is rapidly changing with a new generation and new technology, we are going to have to adapt from our old habits. Young adults are not seeing the full necessity of buying a vehicle when they can get to where they need to go by other means that are less expensive and less harmful to the environment. The need for everyone to have a car is slowly going down. It may never completely go away, but it is reducing greatly.",3,3,4,3,1,2,2,2,2
"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It is important to study Venus because it is simular to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus.

Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit.

It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to.

NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is simular to Earth. Venus once had oceans like the Earth does now. NASA and scientists are looking into possible ways to explore Venus. This exploration will help find new facts about Venus.",2,3,1,2,0,0,0,0,1
"Some may say that they need cars to get around. Some people love thier car and could never dream of giving it away. Some also don't care about cars that much. Well in Germany and Paris cars are banned, yes I said banned. Some people may be shocked at this but others not so much. Some may ask how do they get around places? Some might ask so do they just walk everywhere from place to place? Some may ask do they actually like living without a car? Some might not even agree with the whole banning cars thing and may have lots of other questions. Well if you wanna know the answer to those questions well read on. Pay attention while you're reading and as I explain to you why these people think life is better without cars.

Having a car is important to mom's especially to the mom's that have about three or more kids. Mom's have dudies to do including taking sons to soccer ball games. Well a mom in Vauban, Germany got rid of her car. She actullay enjoy being car-free, and get this seventy percent of Vauban's families don't own a car. Also fifty-seven percent of people sold their car just to live there, obvisously more and more people are agreeing with this no car thing, and they would much rather take buses and taxies.

Now am not saying that everyone will agree about banning cars, read on to see how the people in Parris disobeyed the no car rule and what happened to them. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or pay 22-euro (31 USD). The same would apply the next day for the odd-numbered plates. According to an international news agency headquartered in London almost four-thousand drivers were fined. Twenty-seven people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine.

Some people may not know the real reason that people try to limit car use or even ban it in some countries. Its to take away stress and to lower air pollution. In Bogota, Colombia they had a care-free day and it turned into a big hit. On this car-free day millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses. Leaving the streets of this capital city eerily deviod of traffic jams. You know but not everyone was willing to parcisepte in this event and those people faced twenty-five dollar fines. This program was set to sprend to other countries and it did. For the first time, two other Colombian cities, Cali and Valledupar joined the event, and they were happy.

In conclusion limiting car usage or even banning cars is a good way takes stress and lower pollution.

Having to drive around alot can put a lot of pressure on a person and the pressure is lifted when they dont have to drive anymore. Air pollution is bad there are already a lot of things polluting the air why not make cars one of things thats not polluting the air. Also there will be less car traffic noone likes being stuck in traffic. I think that limiting car usage is a good thing. It will save us in the long run.",2,2,3,3,0,1,1,1,1
"The electoral college should be eliminated. It should be changed to popular vote for the presidential election. With the electoral college, people don't get to have the freedom to vote for who they want to be elected. Instead they vote for a slate of electors who in turn, elect the president for you. There are a few problems with this. One, the electors could end up not doing their job. They might refuse to vote for their party's candidate and end up voting for whomever they please. That could turn into a riot or just leave a lot of people very unhappy. The electors could also mess up their vote and end up voting for the wrong candidate. Say they are loyal to the president they are suppose to vote for, but then end up choking and voting for the opposing president. Further more, what if a state sends two slates of electors to Congress? It happened in Hawaii in 1960. (""What's wrong with the electoral college"") Another thing is a tie could happen. A tie in the electoral vote means that the election then gets handed to the House of Reprsentatives, where they will then vote on the president of their choice. Either way the people do not get a say on who they want for president. It is all in the hands of people that can turn their backs on who they promise they will vote for, and end up voting for the opposing president. If the people got to choose who they wanted to be president, then we wouldn't run into any of these problems. There would never be any ties or broken promises. The electoral college is ""unfair, outdated, and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished.",2,4,2,3,2,2,2,1,2
"In the age of technology, we are constantly searching for better ways to communiucate to computers. It seems as though they are just blocks of plastic, wiring, and metal that have no empathy, brains, or hearts. But what if computers could understand human emotion? The computer could know what we are feeling and give us results to match that mood. This is becoming a reality for society today, as a new software, the Facial Action Coding System has promising results for understanding and catergorizing human emotions. This technology could be used in the classroom, where it would provide a better learning environment for students if the computer could understand the students and know if they were bored or tired, and would adjust its program accordingly.

The Facial Action Coding System was created by Prof. Thomas Huang of the University of Illnois and Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. The FACS first costructs a 3-D model of the face with all 44 face muscles. Movement of one or muscles is called an action unit. Dr. Paul Eckman, another creator of FACS, has ""classified six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated them with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles."" The FACS was tested on the Mona Lisa, and detected her as ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" A computer being able to understand human emotion would be groundbreaking, as ""most human communication is nonverbal, including, emotional communication."" We as humans have a variety of expressions, from huge ones to very subtle changes in mood. Computers need to understand these, along with the subtle facial movements that go with them. A extensive calculation is needed in order to acheive this goal. We humans perform this 'calculation' every day, as we can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face by taking their facial cues into consideration of their emotion. A comptuter that could a similar thing as such would know when you're happy or sad, and then react accordingly. If you were to smile at a Web ad, it would send a similar one. But if you frowned, the next one would be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Hunag predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would allow for a better learning environment and teaching skills for students.

The use of this technology would be outstanding and unbelievably helpful in the classroom. It could accurately identify a student's emotions and change the lesson plan to meet their own academic needs. This technology not only can identify emotions, but can help humans to react to them. With more expressive characters in video games and movies, humans can identify and repilcate such emotions, as we have empathy. Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions, and computers with the FACS software could allow for that and much more to occur. Technology as we know it today could be changed forever. If computers do acquire the FACS software, then it would be able to identify human emotions and adjust accordingly.",2,3,3,3,1,2,2,2,2
"Can you believe there's actually technology that can identify your emotions ? There's a new technology that can show a how a human is feelings. It's called the Facial Action Coding System. This system can be used to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom by showing when kids are getting bored or confused, showing if fake emotions are being used, and help produce emotions.

First off, the system can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom by showing if the kids are bored or confused. By the computer allowing to show how the students are feelings, the teachers can look at that and they can actually change things up a bit in class. On paragraph 6 it says, "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Therefore, the FAC system can feel the same emotions as the students are feeling and show how the students are feeling.

On the other hand, the FAC can also identify if fake emtions are being used. When you fake a smile the system can tell when it a real smile or a forced one. On paragraph 8 it says, "" Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis pars palpabreaus make crow's-feet around your eyes.But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideway using the zygomatic major and different muscle, the risorius."" Which means the FAC knows when the smile is real or fake when the way your smile is being structured.

Lastly, another way that expressing emotions in a classroom is valuable is helping produce emtions. Making an expression can also help you feel an emotion. That way this can help the students show their real emotions. On paragraph 9, the author says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emtions but, also may even help produce them. ""Therefore, that can change whole mood and emotions of a students. Helps students change what they are feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom showing that the system is valuable by showing when kids are getting bored or confused, if fake emotions are being used, and to help produce emotions. So yes, this technology is very valuable for a classroom. FAC can be a great use to read humans.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,2,2
"The technology to identify human emotion in my trance of thought its stupid. I don't think this would be helpful in a classroom because it would just be a waste. in my thoughts i think it would be a waste because some people that are having a bad day might just want to be left alone and not talk about there problems to people. The computer might be able to detect the persons emotions by characterlise there facial muscles by the expression movements but the student might be annoyed that it does this all the time and doesnt like it. In the article it says that "" Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" here it says that Dr. Huang studies different artists and there paintings and how some showed how they used there emotion and some didn't. Its a bad idea to modify a computer to read peoples emotions because when a kid is doing there homework and the kid is bored the computer is going to detect that the kid is bored from doing his/her homework and put a add with a video game and the kid is going to get distracted and fail the assingment.",1,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,0
"I believe we should continue in the making of autonomous cars. There is much to be discovered on it as well as much to be put into it. I would be very careful if I drove one yes, but I do believe the car is capable of what they need and whatthe people need. Yes it will still need human assistnce once in a while during the times of ""...navigating through road work or accidents."" Which will keep the ddriver still in control and not putting others and themselves in danger. As said in the text ""The google car simply announces when the driver should be prepaired to take over."" This may become a problem seeing as most people think that if a car is auto-drive then it needs no human-asscistance and they may just leave it be and let it do it's thing. They decided that to make it easy to tell the driver "" Hey, you should help me drive."" To help with this they put in a vibrating chair to vtell the driver that they should take over. Itis said in the text that some states will welcome these cars once proven safe. This is why I believe they should continue their work. They have things to discover and things to apply to it. They will correct any mistakes and learn what needs to be done. I believe that these cars will one day be perfected and ""driven"".",1,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"i agree with the article, knowing that a technologly can be use to see how people emotions are is pretty cool for someone to know how you and another person is feeling. the resson why i agree to this passage is because i mean it has all sorts of context. the emotions that people have are very important because thats why we all ask each other when somwthing looks wring we always ask and say ""whats wrong"" because we can tell by there emotions. some people lie and say there fine but we know deep down there not.

In the picture you can see that Mona Lisa Smile is not real. so many peoole love with stuff amd keep in there back of there head and just leave it alone, but deep down we all know their thinking about it. "" movement of one or more miscoes is called an ""action unit"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness.

surprie, anger , disgust, fear , and sadness. movement of the facial muscles."" that how Mone Lisa feels. As you look really close into the picture you have see 83 perecent happy , 9 peecent disgusted, 6 perecent fearful, amd 2 perecent angry. artists can make a picture not look like whats the person is feeling

Mone Lisa as we all know is a very strong independent woman. we all kmow she was going through some tuff times. i feel like everyone asked her if she was okay. and than everyone had went to a conclusion. ""lets make a system on peoples emtions."" everyone believed that their was gonna be thsi system to figure how peoole were gonna react. And when we tried it in Mona

Lisa we all knew that the technology was gonna work. Mone Lisa was a cery hard working last who never would show her emtion to anyone. until the technology was imvented.

Nicu sebe of the university of amsterdam had memrion feom the text that "" expert at deveopling better ways for humans and computers to communicate. people really know now on how people feel and there real feelings are being shown. i think its for the better anyways, reason being is because if we did not know how people felt that mean we would not be able to stop people would harm them selfs.

i think this techology is a good way to start this world into a better way than just asking peoole on how they feel and making them think about it more. people can find all different ways to makes somene else feel better. Mone Lisa never speaked up she would always say she was fine. she wiukd always bave a smile in the back of her head. but she knew no one would ever understand her so she never told anyone and just never spoke like the feeling she always felt.",1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that driverless car would be a waste a money. I dont think that anybody would trust a car driving itself around. i personally think that people would feel safer driving themselfves around than a computerized car. Some people may think that a car that can drive itself could be useful and it some ways it may be. It could be safer because less people could txt and drive, or drink and drive, that could cause lesss wrecks. On the down side if they cant fix the car when it goes through traffic and the person is asleep then the car wont know what to do and it could cause another wreck going through one. It could also cause another wreck if it was going through a construction site. That could be b ad because construction sites are already buisy enough and cramed enough.

Most people would prefer to dirve them,selves to work or to school every day. I dont trust technology, i think that it has brought our world to crap. The governmant isusing it just to get money and that is what these cars are for. Its just to gets civilians money. I would feel safer because i know where i am going and if there is a crash or a construction zone i know how to handle it and know where to go or how to get where i need to go. Also i wouldnt half to worry abput falling asleep and the car not knwoing what to do or some one ramming into the back of my car. The safest way that i would think to have a caar that could drive on its own is to have magnets in the road and the opposite polarity in the car some where so that the car has a path to guide it.

"The Facial action coding system is a good idea to used in estudents beacuse almost the 50% of the students are shy an they dont want to ask when they are confused and bored so if teachers know how they feel they can help them. A classroom computer could reconigze when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ."" the same technology can make computers-combined faces more expressive- for video games or videos surgery. Many people are going to like this becuase that can help techers, students, and all people that cna get it. Did you know that exist a new sofwart making by Dr. Paul Eckman called "" The Facial Aciton Coding"" that indentify the humans emotion that it can used in all people bout we can used in students to show how they are feeling. The process begin when the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major mucles in the model must move like humans muscles. movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"". Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions that are happiness, surprise, anger, disguits, fear and sadness -and then associated each whit characteristic movements os the facial muscles. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, Dr. Huang thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly), The software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a natural face showing no emotions. the monal lisa demostration is really intendet to bring a smile to your face. Imagine making a computer that know when you are sad or happy it can be good for people. In conclusion this idea is really amazing besause it helps people and almost all the people are confused beacuse they dont know how they feel about something, this computer with the sofware it can be good for school because al students got confiused in something bout someones are shy an they dont want to ask to the teachers to make the aclaration about the thing that they are confiused and it can be better for teachers making more things intesting.",1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Venus is presented as a valid candidate for exploration in the near future. The author presents evidence to support that it could be possible one, but is it worth it? As well as many positives of exploring Venus, there are just as many, if not more, negatives to this expedition. This mission seems very dangerous considering what would be taken from this research. Venus may have been like Earth in the past, but now there are too many dangers in exolring. The author does not give a convincing argument that going to Venus is worth the risk considering the dangers that are present.

One of the main risks of going to Venus is the high pressure and temperature. At a temperature of 800 degrees farenheit and a pressure that would crush a submarine, it's safe to say that traveling to Venus could be an extreme risk. The only evidence given to argue that a visit to Venus would be worth it, is the evidence that Venus used to be most like Earth and it is close by. With the evidence given there is not a strong enough argument there to convince anyone that tackling these dangers to venture to Venus would be worth it.

For the good of science and research, yes a trip to Venus would be extraordinary. However with the dangers presented in this article, there is just not a great need to put people at risk for it. Venus may be an interesting point of research for mankind and maybe it will happen one day, but right now it shouldn't be an option. The author has valid evidence that show that these obstacles can be overcome, but there is no evidence to support that these efforts are worth the risk.",3,3,2,3,2,3,3,4,3
"The Facial Action Coding System takes science to a whole new level. Once people are able to read facial expressions, communication becomes much easier. Humans communicate mostly by thier own faces. We humans have come to know that reading a persons face can tell a lot about them. Having facial recognition in

schools will help the students.

Going to school is a new experience everday. Seeing new people in the halls to trying to figure out a new lesson in class. Each student has their own way of learning. Communicating with peers. With all the same boring lessons everyday, school can become a boring learning enviroment.

Facial recognition would change how students think of thier learning enviroments. In the article Dr. Huang predicts that if FACS is used in a learning enviroment the lessons would be changed by looking at the students facial expressions. The computer could see if the sudents were becoimg bored or confused. The computer then would change the lesson to make the students become more engaged. This would help the students focus more and understand the lesson. Maximizing the lesson to the best of its ablility to help the students.

This technology would help the students feel like the lesson isn't boring. The facial features of every person are different. The classroom is filled with twenty to thirty faces every class. With the new FACS system would help the teachers and students become more active with thier lesson. By reading the faces of the students the FACS changes the lesson. Thus making the lesson more enjoyable for everyone.

In conclusion, having a learning enviroment that functions for youself and with others is the greatest possible outcome. The FACS in the classroom would maximize everyone's lerning ablility. If you get the maximum learning ablity out of a lesson, the lesson shoulnd't have to be retaught. Intern, students are getting the most out of the lesson everyday and not being bored by learning the same lessons.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,0
"After reading the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" my aspect of the topic is negative. Throughout the pharagraphs in this writing, I will explain as to why I think of driverless cars as a negative aspect.

Yes, driverless cars would be awesome, but I still think of it as a negative aspect. In the text, it notes how driverless cars can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but also must still alert the driver where the car may be driving and navigating through road construction ahead or problems about the roads in general. Therefore the driver still must remain alert and ready to take the wheel when there maybe a situation.

The point of a driverless car, is it it literally driverless, meaning the driver does not have to worry about having to put there hands on the wheel in certain situations. A driverless car should be a car where the person is able to sit back without a worry of having to be alert at most times.

Some people in this world enjoy driving, and find it fun. In the future they should have the choice of a driverless car or just a normal car where you are able to drive it yourself. The difference between the two cars should be you either get to drive the car, with full attention, hands on the wheel, doing your own thing with no help. Or a driverless car, a car where you ultimantly don't do any driving at all and you can sit on back and relax and enjoy the ride.

Passengers of a driverless car should not have a worry about having to put there hands on the wheel, hence why they are calling it a driverless car. Yes, some roads may be dangerous, but a driverless car should be able to handle it if it is manufactured right. A passenger in this specific car should not worry about his or her safety, and the safety of others in the vechicle.

In conclusion, Driverless cars in my argument will have a negative outcome. My argument about this topic is due to safety issues. It also is due to the fact the car is called a driverless car, the driver/passeger should not be touching the wheel. Touching the wheel would be considered driving. If manufactures in the future could think of a way where the driverless care is actually driverless, and there are no worries or safety issues, than yes I am all for driverless cars.",2,3,1,2,0,1,1,1,0
"BAM!!!!. Knowing that you crashed your new driverless car due to a technical failure, must suck. Driverless cars should be a dream not a goal. I am against the development of these cars, Its dangerous!.These cars require lots of attention because you never know your car could crash at any time.

The main reason why I am against driverless cars is because the danger it could cause. technology always fails at one point in life and using it on cars could cost a life. As said in paragraph 9, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"". Driverless cars requires lots of attention even though they're ""Driverless"". These cars arent smart enough to recognize signs or advanced problems, paragraph 8 states ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver? Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"",

Driverless cars coming soon, What? before even thinking about driverless cars think about the money it will cost to upgrade roads !. These cars will not work off-road unless they want to put more more in these extras roads. In paragraph 3 it says,"",but they require massive upgrades to existing roads, something that was simply too expensive to be practical. Building these car will also require lots of money to biuld and buy.

Thinking of getting a driverless car in your near future? I don't think so. Risk yourself and your money if you want to be in a situation of life or death. Driverless cars should be a dream not a goal . I am strongly against the development of these cars.",2,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0
"The idea/concept of driverless cars is revolutionary, humans wouldn't need to drive ever again. Cars since 2009 have been able to drive themselves without a single crash. Google has made it an option to drive the car under specific conditions like navigating through road work or accidents, pulling in and out of driveways, and dealing with complicated traffic."" The cars would use half of the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus"", says Sergey Brin. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world.

I think that it is a great idea to actually be able to get in a car that drives itself. It would feel like a luxury. The article says that there are some major liability conflicts between companies right now over the issue of who would be responsible for if there was a wreck. Would it be the driver or the manufacturer? The idea of a driverless car still needs to be worked on and equipped with more technology and more assurance that the car is safe.

These cars would be rarely seen when finally on the market just like a prius. Some studies show that it could be boring not being able to drive. ""The psychological aspects of automation are really a challenge,"" admits Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human dirver in control at all times. Even when there is a human in control driving is never safe, because you constanty have to worry about humans not being responsible drivers.

The artical states that, ""automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"". The problems might be solved and the cars might drive perfect but nothing is perfect. There is still going to be defects on the cars and by then it will be too late when people are injured. I think it is not a good idea to do this, because its not completely reliable and would defeat the purpose of being able to drive. America would only get lazier and soon technology will do everything for us. This is what I am afraid of, because we will get used to everything being done for us and we won't know how to do anything outselves. Cars should stay how they are and let humans get some activity in besides walking from the door to the car then being driven where they need to go.

The idea is very nice, but I wouldn't buy a car like that just for safety precautions. Technology is slowly taking a huge role in life now and I just think it's moving too fast. We are more focused on technology now than enjoying life itself. Teens can't live without phones anymore, and teachers are constantly using them. Things should just go back to paper and pencil.",3,2,2,2,1,2,1,2,2
"For starters, the power to read someones emotion is too much, what if the person dose not want to be read and would like some privacy. Facial recognition is already a thing and the reading emotions is a useless waste of tax dollars for more reason than one.

if this is a goverment funded project, then, one why, and two, what for. in the case that you are wasting money for things more immportant, like fixing the hunger epidemic, or stopping corupt people from oppressing others, you have decided to make a technology that reads faces, there are uses for this tech, but is it what we need or is it something that can wait untill everyone is happy and healthy. Understaning that there are uses for tech like this, what other uses does it have, the only thing for it is the ""makeing school lessons less boring"".

In another case, people not wanting to be read like a book and having it done anyway, dose not sound like fun. Creating a socity where everyone knows how everyone else feels, there are flaws that will devistate populations, perhaps someone dose not want to talk about somthing and the compter or cellphone with this new tech dose not know this, then offends the persson by telling a dark secret or spilling the beans about your emotions to some blabermouth that spits the info to the internet for example ""to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling polititinn or celebrity isn't being truthful."" not only dose this tech give people the power to see through fake smiles, but it is also a hudge invasion of privacy and should be frowed upon, then again when has a polititian ever been truthful to begin with.

The main point is, with this tech taking away the ability to hold a secret, it makes our socity seem like robots and always wanting to be read like a book and have our emotions described as ""numbers on a spread sheet"" or words on a screen. The entire reason we are human is because we can read emotions without the use of a machiene telling us how we feel, insted of our friends asking us ""are you okay"" a computer program says ""you are feeling sad"" after some trgic event. Also the program has only basic emotions and feelings progamed into it, nothing as complex as a state of deep depretion.

However this program could be useful for diegosing depression and stats that doctors still have trouble finding. Imagine if insted of reading feeling and telling you how you feel, the program could, for say; recomend a way to feel better if you are sad, or help relive anger stress with some soothing music, and even help make sure everyone is happy with out the big buck spending for therpy of a phycologist.

In conclution there are both good and bad things this program can do, but with all that power come a lot of risk and exposure. Read somthing wrong and disaster wil stike.

"Studying Venus is a worthy persuit alhtough it presents some dangers. Studying Venus and sending a spacecraft or even people would further our knoledg on the planet, it could help us further our technology aswell, and it is Earth's ""twin"".

We could learn so many new htings about the planet. Things that cant be seen because of Venus's thick atmosphere. We already know that the Earth and Venus have many things in common like mountains and vallys and craters, but if there were to be a mission on Venus where a space craft lands or an actual human is sent ont he ission we could discover how Venus came to have those mountains and valleys and craters.

With furthering our knoledge about the planet we could also further our knoledge in our technology. There has not been any spacecraft that has been named that has gone on a mission to Venus becuase they never last more than a few hours. We could betterthat technology so that the spacecrafts can last a lot longer to where ventually we can send people. We can have a simulated enviorment of Venus and test different materials to see which works best and improve it as we go. The improvements in technology could help us in future missions aswell.

Venus in known to have things in common with Earth which is another reason why Studyig Venus is a worthy pursuit. It is the planet that resebles Earth in its geography and it would be worth knowing how Venus got that. We can also discover new ways in which it is our planet's ""twin"".

We should take to challenge and study Venus. It may take years and it is dangerous but it is a worthy pursuit. We are aware of the dangers and difficulty of studying Venus; it is just the matter of accepting the challenge or not.",2,3,2,3,0,1,1,2,1

""not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. every day people are studying this planet. i think maybe one day people will be able to live on venus and that venus might be our new planet. this is why i think studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Technology to read emotional expressions of students is not valuable because the software is not compatible with all generations of computers. It would cost a lot of money to upgrade all computers for schools around the world. Technology to read expressions is also not valuable because in the passage it explains how the technology can find ones hidden emotion. That is invading privacy because they are hiding their emotions for a reason and maybe they don't want to be bothered and a teacher may try to talk to them about it.

Knowing ones hidden emotional can be invading privacy but it also has benefits. The benefits could be for identifying ones anger that has the mentality to inflict harm to someone or something. It could also alert the teacher because there could be a disturbance. He or she could pull the student aside incase they cannot handle their emotions or have a panic attack. The software could also prevent fights and agruments because the teacher would see the students emotions and help. But that still does not stop the fact at the end of the day that is an invasion to privacy because sometimes emotions are suppose to be kept on the inside. Last but not least the pricing becasue in the article it does not give price but the software might cost and it would still cost money to upgrade school computer to get the software.

Although the technology has benefits it should still not be used. Even though it has value it is stll not worth it price wise and the invasion of ones privacy. At the end of the day every school does not have money. It could also be a safety problem becuse student will feel like they're being spyed on. Not just by the teacher but the government becuse the government is attached through many softwares.",2,3,1,2,1,1,1,1,1
"Throughout history, mankind has depended on hands-on work for critical purposes.

However, technology has evolved as a tool to assist us to do labor more efficiently and quickly.

It is an important decision whether or not to support driverless cars because it can affect the conflicts due to this choice.

Human error has been a common factor for automobile accidents across the nation, which has claimed many lives.

Driverless cars can be another tool for the human population that could save lives.

To begin with, manufacturers have tinkered on this project for many years by several strategies such as General Motors and their concept car that ran on a unique test track.

It began in the 1950s, using binary code to alert the car system.

Unfortunately, upgrades in that period of time were too expensive to be used widespread.

This began the alternative option of smarter cars, rather than intellegent roads to assist drivers.

Likewise, the government is obstinant on testing for every single liability smarter cars can be held for.

It is above all priorities for the smarter cars to ensure complete saftey from dangerous hazard conditions on the road.

To prevent such conditions, developers considered the use of driverless cars to assist drivers instead of total control at all times.

Furthermore, scientists and engineers have added ideas from each other, enabling cars to even sensor dangerous obstacles.

For example, the BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" is one of the many cars that can preform driverless to a certain extent, allowing for a human driver to access the controls if necessary.

This evidence concludes that driverless cars are potential as a wonderful tool to help in the saftey of others in a vehicle.

Driverless cars could be the next common technology among the human population like computers or phones.

From this, humanity will continue evolving and strive through conflicts similar to this subject.

However, another choice for us, individually is whether or not to accept change.",1,2,2,2,1,1,2,1,2
"In this article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they have both postive things to say about this and they have negative things to say about cars.

First, my position on driverless cars to me is a good thing because if you have to parallel park in between two cars and you're not very good then thats when the car can do it and park it perfect for you.

It's also good because say if you're texting and u drop your phone and go to pick it up and there is a car in front of you...then the car would automatically stop for you so you dont crash.

Second, It's bad because you never know when the car can mess up on you. But f anything does happen then it wont be your fault it would be the manufacturing people's fault for not checking to see if everything is good with the car. Some people wouldn't even want a driverless car because they will get bored waiting for their turn to drive.

In the end it all depends on whether or not you want a driverless car, but there are going to be very nice driverless cars in the future. I would get one but I would want it tested before I buy it because I wouldnt want to spend a lot of money on a car that didnt work like the manufactures said it would. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars drives themselves by 2020.",1,2,1,2,1,1,1,1,2
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the technology that the author describes called Facial Action Coding System, that lets you make up and show human emotions in pictures.

I am for this new use of technology, Only because when taking a picture in the old times alot of people really didn't smile they just looked at the artist, while the artist painted them. I feel as though this is a good thing, not because it creates emotion in the picture, it gives the person looking more understanding of how maybe the person in the picture is feeling. I find it very cool that they can use a 3D scale model of the face and maintiain the muscles in the face that move just like our muscles in or face move today. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

Also I find it cool how the famous painter ""Da VInci could study human anatomy enoough to help him pain the facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" When I look at the new Mona Lisa painting I do smile and think that maybe she was happy to have taken this picture, I mean we'll never know what she really felt in the painting. All we know is what we see today and thats her smiling.

So in conlcusion I do agree and am for the Facial Coding Symstem all the way. It makes the paintings and pictures look nice, and have more emotion. So im all for it.",2,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

"For years I've heard that voting time is the choice of the people. But with Electoral College, it's not about the people; it's about the slate electors. When voting for what president the people want, they aren't voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors. But if two people are going for president, and one wins the national popular vote but the other has more electors votes; the one with more electors votes will be president. I think changing the election to popular voting for the president would be better than Electoral College, I'm not the only one that agrees.

When voting time comes around you see a lot of publicity about each person running for office months before the actually voting time. And between that time of the publicity starts and to the voting date you are picking which person you want in office. You may do some research, listen to all the radio or TV interviews, and/or watch all the speeches each person does. The whole time you are set on one person to be president. But yet you can't vote for them, becuase of Electoral College. You vote for the slate electors, the electors vote for the president. Maybe your slate elector doens't want that person, they can vote for the other runner. Voters can't always control whom their electors votes for. Sometimes voters get confused on the electors and vote for the wrong candidate.

To pick a electors to depends on the state. Maybe it's a state convention, state party's central committee who chooses, maybe the presidential candidates themselves even. It's not always the people's choice on who is president. It has happened before, two people gone for president, one gets more national votes while the other has more electors votes. And of course, the one with more electors votes goes into office. Even though the people decided they wanted the other runner.

During elections the runner for president tend to only pay attention to the more populated state such as California, New York, Florida, and Texas rather than the smaller states that have less number of electoral votes like Hawaii, Alaska, North and South Dakota, or New Hampshire.

According to Bradford Plumer in ""The Indefennsible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and AFL-CIO all agreed on getting rid of electoral college. Over 60% of votes would rather have a direct election to having Electoral College. They rather have a president win by popular vote than having slate electors vote on a president for them.

Voting for a leader of your country should be the people's choice. Not slate electors. It should be by popular vote, not Electoral College's vote. I say listen to the people, vote on popular vote.",3,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as ""The Face on Mars."" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.

Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.

On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.

Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was. Now NASA had proved that this brilliant ""face"" was only a landform.

NASA did endless amounts of research in hopes of finding evidence of martian life, so why would they hide something like that? Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform. The research NASA has put into may not have given them the results they wanted, but it may later benefit them in finding life on Mars.",3,4,3,4,1,2,2,2,2
"The face that you seem to see on Mars is just a big misunderstanding. Many conspiracy theorists have made up stories about this face in order to get money and popularity. Even though it is actually just a mesa in the middle of Mars, located in Cydonia. There are many mesas in the western United States and aren't made from any alien race.

This article states that the Face is,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This illusion is what conspiracy theorists use to make it viral. It also proves how there is no face at all. It is all just a big shadow of a mesa in Cydonia.

On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia. Michael Malin and his team used the Mars Orbiter Camera to take photographs of the face. These photographs were ten times sharper than those of the previous Viking missions. They revealed that is was just a natural mesa and there wasn't anything to do with aliens at all.

April 8, 2001 was a day that completely changed and confirmed that there was nothing more than a mesa in Cydonia. The Mars Orbiter Surveyor can take pictures with one pixel being 1.56 meters, while the early Viking photographs had pixels that were 43 meters. This high definition camera took a picture of the face again. Being able to zoom in up to 3 times larger than the normal picture, the team found out there weren't any structures or figures on the face.

There is plenty of evidence that can prove there isn't anything wrong with the area in Cydonia. Going from high defintion photographs with modern technology to zoom in and spot out evidence or old photos showing shadows of the mesa walls. There are plenty of conspiracies that have been proven false by these photos and research of the NASA workers. This has proven that the Face on Mars was never actually a face or alien structure, but a normal everyday mesa.",2,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,3
"Waking up early on a Monday morning is already horrible, but the traffic is worse. Imagine a car that could drive for you, while you can relax. Sounds great, only your self driving car doesn't drive through traffic, roadwork, or accidents. Throughout the last decade many car companies have developed prototypes of ""driverless"" cars, though none are really driverless, in some states they are illegal to drive, and have many safety concerns, developing this car would make humans lazier than we already are. This ""driverless"" car would cause more harm than good, by creating this car we are inabling humans.

These cars are still developing, to respond to the varying safety regulations that need to be made for this model. Foremost they want to adress the saftety aspects of when the car needs the human to take over. Although this car is said ""driverless"" in certain situations such as, when pulling in or out of driveways, responding to traffic issues, driving through roadwork, and accidents. This feature of the car puts many people off. When they hear a driverless car they expet a car where their presence is not needed to steer through traffic. Though the car has many sensors to navigate through traffic, it is still necessary for the human to drive through obsticals. The sensors being used are suppose to mimic a human's driving skills, then why can it not navigate through traffic, without the use of a human?

To many these cars may still seem as a good investment, but what about the government? Driving laws are written for the mindset of a human. ""As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming) States such as, California and Flordia have allowed limited use of 'semi-autonomus' cars. Once the safety of the cars is superb it is expected that more states will follow their lead. Also, the question of, whose fault is it for an accident? For cars that include the help of a human to navigate through some situations, it could be blamed on the human. Yet, for cars that are the sole drivers, and do not require a humans assistance, accidents could be blamed on the manufacturer. This could create many law suits and conflicts between automobile companies that produce these cars and the owners.

Waking up to drive in traffic may be annoying, but it is safer than trusting a ""driverless"" car. With the safety problems yet to be fixed, laws prohibiting the usage, and the need for humans to still pay attention, it makes for the driverless car to be undesirable to most. These cars may improve in the future but, I am still against their production.",3,3,1,2,1,1,2,1,2
"Cars that can drive themselves? Twenty years ago, cars that drive themselves were only seen in movies. In today's modern society we have had the technology and the people to make a movie-like fantasy into reality. Google has been working on a car since 2009, that does not need a human operating it one-hundred precent of the time. However, these autonomous casr are not completely driverless. All in all, autonomous cars can help and change our world for the better.

Autonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone. The dirverless car, with the use of lasers, are so advanced that they can detect and respond to danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. This technology can prevent hundreds of accidents and lives everyday. When the car sensors danger it doesn't immediately slam into the brakes like a human would, potentially causing a problem. Instead, the car applies the breaks while reducing power from the engine, allowing far better control that any human could have by themselves. ""...making driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Another example of how autonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone is with the development of the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". This development allows the driver to obtain control over the car if needed. For example, a work zone or accidnet is ahead, the car notifies the driver ot take over. ""This necesitates the car being ready to quickly get the drivers attention whenever a problem occurs."" Autonomous cars also may have camereas just to reassure the driver isn't letting the car do all the work. This can help prevent accidents or disaterous situations. If the driver is texting and the car senses a problem, the car will get the drivers attention and thus by-passing any collison or problem. ""While the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver."" Autonomous cars can potentially be safer than humans alone.

While autonomous cars have all these new developments that can prevent many situations, they can also be potentially disaterous. For example, if the car were to malfunction and not brake when it senses danger, it could be extremely dangerous for the human. Today traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. However, there are hundreds or car accidents when humans had full control of the car evryday. With the autonomous car, that rate can potentially drop drastically. An example would be a human is texting and driving, and they dont notice its

red light and cause an accident. With autonomus cars the car would alert the human, making them realize. Autonomous cars have many pros and few cons.

Cars that can drive themselves are no longer movie fanatsies. They are in our real lives, and plan to hit the streets in as early as 2020. With new technologies they can save lives and make our lives easier. Give them a shot and see how autonomous cars can help and change our world for the better.",3,3,2,2,0,2,1,1,1
"The aurthor say's that it is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of going to venus. He says that it is dangerouse and not worth it. He said 'it is very challenging and it is proved' which means its hard to get their and could be dangerouse. Many people tried to go their but never landed on venus. They even also sent out space crafts and they disapear or just dont even make it close to venus.If someone evr makes it their it would be dangourouse.

No space craft has made it their for more then 3 decades. He says that that it is dangerouse beacause of the bad things that could happend , like if humans

go check it out it will be bad because there is acid flowing around the air.

If a human ever makes it their it could be dangerouse if they are their for to long. They have a limit of how long they should stay their.

"The limiting of persoanlcar usage has done wonders for the areas that this policy has be implmented. Strictly enviermentaly swpeaking in the cites that have limited their residents persoal car usage the smog rates went drasicly down. Thoughschanges happened in a matter of days. Imagin the changes that could accoure if limited car usage was implmented on a wider scale for the long term. Not only envirermentaly benifical but limited car usage also has large and far reaching econmic and social upsides. The lack of money being waisted on persoanl automobeal transportation leads to a surplus of savings for everyday familes to spend or more nessary items. Socialy limited car usage has be proven to be benifal as a whole also. People living in areas that have  already been placed under this polices report signifigent reducions in stress and worrying, leading to much weight off their sholders and a genaeral better aqttude over all.

The first and most obveous advantage of the limed car usage policiy is the masive positive impact the police has the earth. As stated in source one and I quote ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."". Now imagin if thoes percentages just went away. In the city of Vauban Germany, an expermental city already under the policy, it did. Another example if Paris. A city that literly had to force the policy of limited car usage apon it people in a desperate attempt to reverse what the evils of personal car usgae was doing to the atmosphere of the city. The personal cars created smog so think the city hit record polution levels that even rivaled Beijing its self, one of the worlds most poluted citys. As stated in source two, the city put a ban on cars with any license plates that were even numbered on the first day from driving and a ban on odd numbered the second day. The positives of the limited car usage plicy was so instantanous that the second day of no driving for odd numbered cars ws deamed not nessary. The massive envirmental advantages of the limited car usage policiy can neiter be denyed or ignored.

The economic advantages of this policy can also not be ignored. To fully grasp the economic upswing that will accure under this policy we must turn our attention the the great city of Bogota, Colombia. In this former Spanish colony turned capital city a program has been set up called the ""car-free day"". On this day no cars are driven and a festable is set up to promote alternate transportaion and reduce smog. This year two other Colombian citys, Cali and Valledupar joned the event citing the obouse advantages of the policy. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" says buisinessman Carlos Arturo Plaza source 3 quotes. The policy as done economic wonders not only for the people but for the city its self. since the day begin in the mid 1990s over 118 miles of bike path have been created, parksand sports centers have bloomed throughout the city, uneven sidke walks have been leveled out, and new resturants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up as reported by source 3. The limited car usage policy cound be the merical policy for citys in need of an economic boost.

Finaly the social advantages of the policy have also been noted.

The evils of the modern day car culture must be destroyed. As said by Carlos Plaza preveously ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"". ""When i had a car I was always tense. Im mush happier this way"" said Heidrun Walter resident of Vauban. Two people on two totaly differnt sides of the world both experenced the social advantages of this policy. Even young people are seeing the advantages according to a study last year that found that driving by young people devreased  23 percent between 2001 and 2009 according to source 4.

As one can now clearly see the advantages of limted personal car usage are impossibkle to deny and even harder to ignore. Economicly,socialy, and enviromentaly this policy as done wonders where ever it has been implimented. It has both immeadit and long term positive effects with no odveous negitive effects. Altrnates to personal cars could be things like Bill fords bisiness plan for a world in which personal vehical ownership is replaced witha partnering with the telecommunications industy to create citys in which pedestrians, bicycle, private cars, and public and commerical traffic are woven into a connected netword. The acceptence of limited car usage and the extenciton of modern day car culture is the next step for the advacment of humanity.",3,3,3,2,0,1,1,1,0
"When we use facial expressions it lets the person you are directing the expressions to know how we are feeling. We smile because we are happy, we frown because we are sad, we raise our eyebrows because we are shocked or surprised. We use usually identify those pretty well, but a computer can identify them better. I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.

When I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.

Students get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them. They want something that will entertain them and help them learn at the same time. With this new technology, student's facial expression will be identified when they like or don't like something. Teachers then can change the way the lesson is taught without changing the lesson at all as told in paragraph 6.

This is a new way to change how schools teach. More students would want to come to school and teachers would have an increase in successful students. Knowing what we didn't know is creating more ideas to the future.",2,3,3,2,1,1,1,1,2
"The Electoral Collge is a process where electors vote for President and Vice President, and count the number of electoral votes by Congress. Many people are debating whether or not keep the Electoral College or change it to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Although the Electoral College has been taking place for many years now, it can be a disaster factor. I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished and changed to a election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it will make the election fair, the chance of there being a tie is much less, and it will be rather rational as oposed to the Electoral College.

The Electoral College is not fair and it is irrational. Voters don't vote directly to the president they want. According to Source 1: ""What is the Electoral College?"" voters actually voting for their candidate's electors. Majority of the states have a ""winner- take- all"" system in which electors are awarded to the winning candidate. Voters don't get to chose who exactly they want, it's based upon which elector they chose that really determines who will win the presidential election. The voters can't always control what the elector they chose does with what thy're decision was on who they wanted to win the election, and they just as well get confused and sometimes possibly make the wrong choice. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States is fair for anyone who votes. There is less chance of getting confused and less chance of picking the wrong elector. Even though others may argue that each party selects trusted electors to vote for the patry's nominees, it's still not fair to those who get confused and end up picking the wrong elector which leads to wrong vote towards the presidential election.

The chances of it turning out to be a tie aren't low. Accoring to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral Colleg: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", a tie has happened before. States have sent two states of electors to Congress. Although it happened long ago, it doesn't mean that it won't occur anytime again. Abolishing the Electoral College can give a less chance for that to occur. Since staes have the ""winner- take- all"" system, the candidates don't even spend time or focus on the states that thye know they have no chance in winning in. According to source 2, there were seventeen states who didn't even get to see the election at all, and some votes didn't even get to see the ad of the campaign.

The presidential election will become rational to many people. There may be cons to abolishing the Electoral College but there are more pros to it rather than cons. It would make the presidential election fair and easier for the voters voting for the candidates. People may argue that it's best to keep the Electoral College because some states may not have enough people voting for the candidates so it wouldn't be possible to directly vote for the president of the United States but there are more states who do have the chance to chose and make a direct decision rather than picking an elector who may or may not go agaisnt the party that had picked them and then they can end up chosing who they, the electors want instead of what the voter really wanted and intended. Many people may be able to agree that it is best to abolish the Electoral College instead of keeping it. The electors are picked mostly based upon the state.

Abolishing the Electoral College is the fair, rational, and beneficial thing to do. Keeping the Electoral College won't benefit the presidential election in any way possible. It's better to keep the election fair than otherwise. Voters should be able to know exaclty who they're picking without any confusion or without accidently picking the wrong person. People shouldn't need to be confused about who they're picking and they shouldn't have to posibly worry at the fact that the elector they voted for might defy the will of the voters and they would pick who they, the voters feel like picking rather than picking who the voters vote was actually intended for in the first place. There are risks to basically putting the voters vote in someone elses hands and the voters vote can easily be changed by one of the electors that the party had picked because they trusted that person. If the presidential election was about who you can pick directly, then it would be much easier and the voters will know that the presidential election was fair and nothing was done to change who they voted for in the beginning.",4,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,1
"I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys Program. If you think you shouldn't I will give you two

very good reasons why you should. But remember it's a once in a life time thing.

First of if your the kind of person that likes to save the community or help others this is the perfect job for it. If get you join the club you'll be saving lots of animals, people, plants,and habitats. The cows can be saved by building a farm. The animals like dear, wolfs, and squirrels and all the other animals can be saved by the forest. Sharks and fish and the other sea living animals can be saved by not putting polluted thing in the water. Snakes and the coyotes can be saved by helping the desert animals.

Second, if your the kind of guy or women that likes to climb, or go on journeys, and swim then this also the perfect club. You'll go climb mountains and sail on huge boats and for fun catch fish.

Those are the two amazing reasons now i'll see you there hope you have fun!",2,3,0,3,0,0,0,0,1
"dear state senator i think you should change to election by popular vote because its worked for us in the past no one can cheat on the voting. those are just some of the reasons we should change to election by popular vote  as a voting system.

first of all we should change to election by popular vote. because its the easiest way of voting because if we keep using the electoral college according to source 3 its un fair because states that are bigger get more attention than smaller states. and also source 2 says ""its official the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational the best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality"".

second of all election by popular vote is the fairest way of voting because unlike the electoral college tjhe popular vote would make the number of votes per state even so not on state gets more votes than another. according to source 3 ""the number of electoral votes depends on the size of the state in which you live so the means if you live in a small state your state gets less electoral votes than a big state"". and in the electoral college some people chaet and vote more than once giving that president an even bigger chance of winning.

the final reason i think we should change to the election by popular vote is its more efficient think about it would you want a voting method that depends on the size of your state i mean what if you lived in rhode island where you get 3 electoral votes versus texas which has 38 electoral votes but with the election by popular vote it counts which canidate has more votes and based on those numbers thats who gains presidency.

in a nut shell the reason we should use the election by popoular vote is its more efficient more fair and easier to decide whos president. so mr senate please read this and consider it i think theese are all very good reasons we should make the change.",2,3,2,2,0,0,0,1,0
"Today's society is not worried about who has the nicest or fastest car, they just want to be able to get from point A to point B. That's why the amount of driving has decreased by 9 percent since 2005. This has helped the environment by reducing the amount of pollution and has made people happier and not as stressed.

As the pollution rate has continued to increase throughtout the years, different countries have incouraged less driving for less pollution. For example, In Bogota, Columbia, their ""goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" Other places, like Paris, banned driving to ""clear the air of the global city."" This is due to ""days of near-record pollution."" The smog cleared after two days of no driving. Having alternative ways of transportation is a way to reduce air pollution.

Another advantage less driving is it makes people happier. Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, says, ""When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way."" Also, businessman, Carlos A. Plaza, said, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress."" as he rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife. When you don't drive, you don't have to worry about being late for work because of traffic jams, you won't be mad because someone just cut you off, or that the teenage girl in front of you isn't paying attention because she is talking on the phone and doing her mascara. Once you get out and ride a bike or walk down the street, you will realize how stressful driving can be.

In conclusion, driving only causes air pollution and more stressfull days. Walking, riding a bike, or riding the bus not only saves money, but it also helps the environment and makes you a happy person.",3,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,3
"Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" when it is no star at all. Venus is a planet right next to Earth. The author provides examples of the advantages of exploring Venus such as getting a better understanding of Venus, its the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. The author believes a worthy pursuit is to study Venus despite the dangers it poses.

First of all, exploring Venus would give us a better understanding of this planet and why it is important we study it. On the planet surface of Venus the tempertures average over 800 degrees, and because of the dense atmosphere most forms of light cannot be penetrated. In the article it states, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astromomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" With the author adding this in his article it proves that studying Venus could benefit the human race in the long run.

Second of all, Venus is the closest planet to Earth. This gives Earth advantages of being able to send out a spacecraft to land on Venus. The article says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too, Eath, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner...humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world."" With this in the article it shows that being able to send out spacecraft to Venus expands the curiosity and imagination of scientists wanting to explore Venus.

Finally, Venus is the most Earth- like planet in the solar system. In the artice it describes, ""Long ago, Venus was provably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Eath. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This proves that Venus could of been just like Earth today.

In conclusion, the authors suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despute the dangers it presents. The author gives us evidence of why its important such as, we would expand our understanding of Venus, it is the closest planet to Earth, and its the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. There is no garantee that the study of Venus will continue, but there are many reasons why it should.",3,3,3,3,1,1,1,1,2
